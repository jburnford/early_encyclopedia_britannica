If two straight lines intersect one another in the centre of a circle, the arch of the circumference intercepted between them is called the measure of the angle which they contain. Thus, (Plate DXXXVII. fig. 1.) the arch AB is the measure of the angle contained by the lines CA and CB.\n\nII. If the circumference of a circle be divided into 360 equal parts, each of these is called a Degree; and if a degree be divided into 60 equal parts, each of these is called a Minute; and if a minute be divided into 60 equal parts, each of these is called a Second, and so on; and as many degrees, minutes, seconds, &c. as are in any arch, so many degrees, minutes, seconds, &c. are said to be in the angle measured by that arch.\n\nCor. 1. Any arch is to the whole circumference of which it is a part, as the number of degrees and parts of a degree in it is to the number 360. And any angle is to four right angles as the number of degrees, &c. in the arch which is the measure of the angle to 360.\n\nCor. 2. Hence also it appears that the arches which measure the same angle, whatever be the radii with which they are described, contain the same number of degrees and parts of a degree.\n\nThe degrees, minutes, seconds, &c. contained in an arch or angle are commonly written thus, $23^\\circ 29' 32''$, which expression means 23 degrees 29 minutes 32 seconds and 20 thirds.\n\nIII. Two angles which make together two right angles, also two arches which make together a semicircle, are called the Supplements of one another.\n\nIV. A straight line BG drawn through B, one of the extremities of the arch AB, perpendicular to the diameter passing through the other extremity A, is called the Sine of the arch AC, or of the angle ACB, having arch AB for its measure.\n\nCor. 1. The fine of a quadrant or of a right angle is equal to the radius.\n\nCor. 2. The fine of an arch is half the chord of twice the arch.\n\nV. The segment AG of the diameter intercepted between its extremity and the fine BG is called the Versed Sine of the arch AB, or of the angle ACB.\n\nVI. A straight line AH touching the circle at A, one extremity of the arch AB, and meeting the diameter CB which passes through B the other extremity, is called the Tangent of the arch AB, or of the angle ACB.\n\nCor. The tangent of half a right angle is equal to the radius.\n\nVII. The straight line CH between the centre and the extremity of the tangent AH is called the Secant of the arch AB or of the angle ACB.\n\nCor. to Def. 4, 6, 7. The fine, tangent, and secant of any angle ACB, are also the fine, tangent, and secant of its supplement BCE. For by the definition, BG is the fine of the angle BCE; and if BC be produced to meet the circle in I, then AH is the tangent and CH the secant of the angle ACI or BCE.\n\nCor. to Def. 4, 5, 6, 7. The fine, versed fine, tangent, and secant of an arch which is the measure of the angle ACB is to the fine, versed fine, and secant of any other arch which is the measure of the same angle, as the radius of the first arch is to the radius of the second.\n\nLet BG, fig. 2. be the fine, AG the versed fine, AH the tangent, and CH the secant of the arch AB to the radius CA; and $b_g : a_g : a_h : c_h$ the same things to the radius CA. From similar triangles BG : $b_g :: BC : b_C$; and because CG : C_G (: CB : C_b) :: CA : C_a; therefore, by division $AG : a_g :: CA : C_a$. Also AH : a_h :: CH : C_h :: CA : C_a.\n\nHence it appears that if tables be constructed exhibiting in numbers the fines, tangents, and versed fines of certain angles to a given radius, they will exhibit the ratios of the fines, tangents, and versed fines of the same angles to any radius whatever. In such tables, which are called trigonometrical tables, the radius is either supposed 1, or some number in the series 10, 100, 1000, &c.\nThe construction and use of these tables we shall presently explain.\n\nVIII. The difference between any angle and a right angle, or between any arch and a quadrant, is called the Complement of that angle, or of that arch. Thus, if the angle ACD, fig. 1, be a right angle, and consequently the arch AD, which is its measure, a quadrant, the angle BCD is the complement of the angle BCA, and the arch BD is the complement of the arch AB. Also the complement of the obtuse angle BCE is BCD, its excess above a right angle; and the complement of the arch BDE is the arch BD.\n\nIX. The fine, tangent, or secant of the complement of any angle is called the cofine, cotangent, or cosecant of that angle. Thus, supposing the angle ACD to be a right angle, then BF = CG, the fine of the angle BCD, is the cofine of the angle BCA; DK, the tangent of the angle BCD, is the cotangent of the angle BCA, and CK, the secant of the angle BCD, is the cosecant of the angle BCA.\n\nThe following properties of the lines which have been defined flow immediately from their position.\n\n1. The sum of the squares of the fine and cosine of any angle is equal to the square of the radius. For, in the right-angled triangle BGC, BC\u00b2 = BG\u00b2 + GC\u00b2, (Geometry, Sect. IV. theor. 13.) Now BG is the fine, and CG = BF is the cosine of the angle BCA.\n\n2. The radius is a mean proportional between the tangent of any angle and its cotangent, or tan. ACB \u00d7 cot. ACB = rad\u00b2. For since DK, CA are parallel, the angles DKC, HCA are equal; now CDK, CAH are right angles, therefore the triangles CDK, HCA are similar, and therefore AH : AC :: CD or AC : DK, and AC\u00b2 = AH \u00d7 DK.\n\n3. The radius is a mean proportional between the cosine and secant of any angle. Or col. ACB \u00d7 sec. ACB = rad\u00b2. For the triangles CGB, CAH are similar; therefore CG : CB or CA :: CA : CH.\n\n4. The tangent of an arch is a fourth proportional to its cosine, its fine and the radius, or tan. ACB = fin. ACB \u00d7 rad. For, from similar triangles CG : GB :: CA : AH.\n\nTrigonometrical tables usually exhibit the fines, tangents, and secants of all angles which can be expressed by an exact number of degrees and minutes from 1 minute to 90 degrees, or a right angle. These may be computed in various ways, the most elementary is to calculate them by the help of principles deducible immediately from the elements of geometry.\n\nIt has been demonstrated in Geometry, (Sect. V. prob. 22,) that the chord of one-sixth of the circumference, or an arch of 60\u00b0, is equal to the radius; therefore, if BD be an arch of 30\u00b0, its fine BF will be half the radius (cor. 2. def. 4.). Let us suppose the radius to be expressed by unity, or 1, then fin. 30\u00b0 = \u00bd; now since a being put for any arch, cof.\u00b2a + fin.\u00b2a = rad\u00b2 (where by cof.\u00b2a is meant the square of the number expressing the cosine of the arch a, &c.) and as fin.\u00b230\u00b0 = \u00bc, therefore cof.\u00b230\u00b0 = 1 - \u00bc = \u00be, &c. Coff. 30\u00b0 = \u221a3/2 = .8660254038.\n\nIt has been demonstrated in the arithmetic of fines (Algebra, \u00a7 356,) that 2 cof.\u00b2a = 1 + cof. 2a; hence we have the following formula for finding the cosine of an arch, having given the cosine of its double; cof. a = \n\n\\[ \\frac{1 + \\text{cof. } 2a}{2} \\]\n\nBy this formula from the cosine of 30\u00b0 we may find that of 15\u00b0, and again from cof. 15\u00b0 we may find cof. 7\u00b0 30', and proceeding in this way we may find the cosines of 3\u00b0 45', 1\u00b0 52' 30\", and so on, till after 11 biflections the cosine of 52\" 44' 31\" 45\" is found; we may then find the sine of this arch by the formula fin. a = \\( \\sqrt{(1 - \\text{cof. }^2 a)} \\). Now, as from the nature of a circle the ratio of an arch to its fine approaches continually to that of equality, when the arch is continually diminished, it follows that the fines of very small arches will be very nearly to one another as the arches themselves: Therefore, as 52\" 44' 31\" 45\" to 1' so is the fine of the former arch to the fine of the latter. By performing all the calculations which we have here indicated, it will be found that the fine of 1' is .000390882.\n\nIt has been shewn in the arithmetic of fines (Algebra, \u00a7 355,) that a and b being put for any two arches, fin. (a + b) = 2 cof. b fin. a - fin. (a - b), hence putting 1' for b, and 1', 2', 3', &c. successively for a, we have,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{fin. } 2' &= 2 \\text{ cof. } 1' \\times \\text{ fin. } 1', \\\\\n\\text{fin. } 3' &= 2 \\text{ cof. } 1' \\times \\text{ fin. } 2' - \\text{ fin. } 1', \\\\\n\\text{fin. } 4' &= 2 \\text{ cof. } 1' \\times \\text{ fin. } 3' - \\text{ fin. } 2', \\\\\n&\\text{&c.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nIn this way the fines for every minute of the quadrant may be computed, and as the multiplier cof. 1' remains always the same, the calculation is easy. If instead of 1', the common difference of the series of arches were any other angle, the very same formula would apply.\n\nThe fines, and consequently the cosines of any number of arches being supposed found, their tangents may be found by considering that tan. a = \\(\\frac{\\text{fin. } a}{\\text{cof. } a}\\); and their secants from the formula sec. a = \\(\\frac{1}{\\text{cof. } a}\\).\n\nWe have here very briefly indicated the manner of constructing the trigonometrical canon, as it is sometimes called. There are, however, various properties of fines, tangents, &c. which greatly facilitate the actual calculation of the numbers, these the reader will find detailed in Algebra, Sect. XXV. which treats expressly of the Arithmetic of Sines.\n\nThe most expeditious mode of computing the fine or cosine of a single angle is by means of infinite series: The investigation of these is given in Fluxions, \u00a7 70.; and it is there shewn that if a denote any arch, then, the radius being expressed by 1,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{fin. } a &= a - \\frac{a^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\frac{a^5}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5} - \\text{&c.} \\\\\n\\text{cof. } a &= 1 - \\frac{a^3}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{a^5}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4} - \\text{&c.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTo apply these we must have the arch expressed in parts of the radius, which requires that we know the proportion of the diameter of the circle to its circumference. We have investigated this proportion in Geometry, Prop. 6. Sect. vi.; also in Fluxions, \u00a7 137.; and subsequently in the article entitled Squaring the Circle.\n\nFrom these series others may be found which fairly express the tangent and secant. Thus because tan.\nNature and Construction of Trigonometrical Tables.\n\n\\[ \\tan a = a + \\frac{a^3}{3} + \\frac{2a^5}{15} + \\frac{17a^7}{315} + \\text{&c.} \\]\n\nAnd in like manner, dividing unity by the series for \\( \\cos a \\), because \\( \\sec a = \\frac{1}{\\cos a} \\), we get\n\n\\[ \\sec a = 1 + \\frac{a^2}{2} + \\frac{5a^4}{24} + \\frac{61a^6}{720} + \\text{&c.} \\]\n\nWe shall conclude what we proposed to say on the construction of the tables, by referring such of our readers as wish for more extensive information on this subject to Dr Hutton's Introduction to his excellent Mathematical tables; also to the treatises which treat expressly of trigonometry, among which are those of Emerson, Simpson, Bonnycafe, Cagnoli, Mauduit, Lagrange, Legendre. In particular, we refer to an excellent treatise on the subject by Mr R. Woodhouse of Caius college, Cambridge.\n\nDescription of the Table of Logarithmic Sines, &c.\n\nThat trigonometrical tables may be extensively useful, they ought to contain not only the fine, tangent, and secant to every minute of the quadrant, but also the logarithms of these numbers; and these are given in Dr Hutton's Mathematical Tables, a work which we have already mentioned; as, however, the fines, &c. or the natural fines, &c. as they are called, are much less frequently wanted than their logarithms, we have only given a table of the latter. See LOGARITHMS.\n\nThis table contains the logarithms of the fines and tangents, or the logarithmic fines and tangents, to every minute of the quadrant, the degrees at top and minutes descending down the left-hand side, as far as 45\u00b0, and from thence returning with the degrees at the bottom and the minutes ascending by the right hand side to 90\u00b0, in such a manner that any arch on the one side is in the same line with its complement on the other, the respective fines, cosines, tangents, and cotangents, being in the same line with the minutes, and on the columns figured with their respective names at top when the degrees are at top, but at the bottom when the degrees are at the bottom. The differences of the fines and cosines are placed in columns to the right-hand, marked D; and the differences of the tangents and cotangents are placed in a column between them, each difference belonging equally to the columns on both sides of it. Also each differential number is set opposite the space between the numbers whose difference it is. All this will be evident by inspecting the table itself.\n\nThere are no logarithmic secants in the table, but these are easily had from the cosines; for since \\( \\sec a = \\frac{\\text{rad.}}{\\cos a} \\), therefore, \\( \\log \\sec a = 2 \\log \\text{rad.} - \\log \\cos a \\); now \\( \\log \\text{rad.} = 10 \\), therefore the log. secant of any arch is had by subtracting its log. cosine from 20.\n\nThe log. fine, log. tangent, or log. secant of any angle is expressed by the same numbers as the log. fine, log. tangent, or log. secant of its supplement; therefore, when an angle exceeds 90\u00b0, subtract it from 180\u00b0 and take the log. fine, &c. of the remainder for that of Nature and Construction of Trigonometrical Tables.\n\nTo find the log. fine of any angle expressed by degrees and minutes. If the angle be less than 45\u00b0, look for the number of degrees at the top, and opposite to the minutes on the left hand will be found the fine required; thus the log. fine of 8\u00b0 10' is 9.15245. But if the angle be 45\u00b0 or more than 45\u00b0, look for the degrees at the bottom and the minutes on the right hand, and opposite will be found the log. fine required. Thus the log. fine of 58\u00b0 12' is 9.92936. The very same directions apply for the cosine, tangent, and cotangent; and from what has been said, the manner of finding the angle to degrees and minutes, having given its fine, &c. must be obvious.\n\nIf the angle consists of degrees, minutes, and seconds, find the fine or tangent to the degrees and minutes, and add to this a proportional part of the difference given in the column of differences for the seconds, observing that the whole difference corresponds to 1' or 60\". Thus to find the log. fine of 30\u00b0 23' 28\", first the fine of 30\u00b0 23' is 9.70396. The difference is 21. As 60\": 28\" :: 21 : \\(\\frac{28 \\times 21}{60} = 10\\) nearly, the part of the difference to be added, therefore the fine of 30\u00b0 23' 28\" is 9.70406.\n\nOn the contrary, let it be required to find the angle corresponding to the tangent 10.14152.\n\nThe next least tangent in the table is 10.14140, which corresponds to 54\u00b0 10'; the difference between the proposed tangent and next least is 12; and the difference between the next least and next greater, as given in the table, is 26; therefore, 26 : 12 :: 60\" : \\(\\frac{12 \\times 60}{26} = 28\"\\) nearly, hence the angle corresponding to the proposed log. tangent is 54\u00b0 10' 28\".","sp":89,"ep":91},{"h":"ENLARGED AND IMPROVED","t":"THE FOURTH EDITION.\n\nIllustrated with nearly six hundred Engravings.\n\nVOL.

It is nearly divided into equal parts by the river Mede or Cowes, which rising in the southern angle, enters at the northern, into the channel, opposite the mouth of Southampton bay. The south-coast is edged with very steep cliffs of chalk and freestone, hollowed into caverns in various parts. The west side is fenced with ridges of rocks, of which the most remarkable are those called, from their sharp extremities, the Needles. Between the island and the main are various sand-banks, especially off the eastern part, where is the safe road of St Helen's. Across the island, from east to west, runs a ridge of hills, forming a tract of fine downs, with a chalky or marly soil, which feed a great number of fine-fleeced sheep. Rabbits are also very plentiful here. To the north of this ridge the land is chiefly pasture: to the south of it is a rich arable country, producing great crops of corn. The variety of prospects which this island affords, its mild air, and the neat manner in which the fields are laid out, render it a very delightful spot. It is devoted almost solely to husbandry, and has no manufactory. It is one of the principal resources of the London market for unmalted barley. Among its products are to be reckoned a pure white pipe-clay, and a fine white crystalline sand; of the latter of which great quantities are exported for the use of the glass work in various parts.

They are situated between the latitudes of 34 and 48 degrees south, and between the longitudes of 166 and 180 degrees east from Greenwich. One of these islands is for the most part mountainous, rather barren, and but thinly inhabited; but the other is much more fertile, and of a better appearance. In the opinion of Sir Joseph Banks and Dr Solander, every kind of European fruits, grain, and plants, would flourish here in the utmost luxuriance. From the vegetables found here, it is supposed that the winters are milder than those in England, and the summers not hotter, though more equally warm; so that it is imagined, that if this country were settled by people from Europe, they would, with moderate industry, be soon supplied, not only with the necessaries, but the luxuries of life, in great abundance. Here are forests of vast extent, filled with very large timber trees; and near 400 plants were found here that had not been described by the naturalists. The inhabitants of New Zealand are stout and robust, and equal in stature to the largest Europeans. Their colour in general is brown, but in few deeper than that of the Spaniard who has been exposed to the sun, and in many not so deep; and both sexes have good features. Their dress is very uncouth, and they mark their bodies in a manner similar to the inhabitants of Tahiti, and which is called tattooing.

If science, while its beneficial influence is felt in all the common pursuits of life, affords scope at the same time to the greatest exertions of human genius; if literature is both the delight and ornament of those by whom it is cultivated; and if history, by bringing under our review the great course of human affairs, enables us to draw lessons for our future conduct from the unerring experience of the past, there can be no question as to the importance of a work comprising so many objects of deep and general interest to mankind. It deserves also to be remarked, that many of those great discoveries which have effected a revolution in science, and which have gradually introduced the most striking changes into the affairs of the world, have been the fruit not of accident, but of the most painful and abstruse inquiries; and that the great powers of invention and genius necessary to explore those intricate paths, do not by any means imply the same capacity of plain and familiar illustration;\u2014those who possess those rare endowments being, on the contrary, rather averse to waste their precious talents on what appears to them to be the natural employment of more ordinary minds. It is hardly necessary, however, to point out to the reader how greatly the cause of philosophy must be promoted, when its important truths, in place of being confined to the speculative few, are expounded in popular works, and in this manner diffused among all classes of the community, so as to be the common topics of men's discourse,\u2014thus adding to their innocent and laudable recreations, and setting to work at the same time, in the cause of literature and science, an additional stock of talent and exertion. Such being the obvious advantages arising from a well-digested account of Science, of Literature, and of General History, we shall not enlarge farther on the utility of the present work. As in such an undertaking, however, the execution is of as much importance as the plan, we shall endeavour, as shortly as possible, to satisfy the reader that, in that particular, no pains nor expense\npence have been spared to render the present edition as perfect as possible, and to give it a fair claim to that share of popularity and reputation, so amply enjoyed by the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica from the first moment of its publication.\n\nIn so complicated a work, it is obviously of infinite importance to preserve a clear and accurate arrangement, so as to give unity and consistency to its various parts; for it is evident that, without constant attention to method and order, such a work may be rendered in a great measure useless: and though it may still be an immense and valuable register of knowledge, the reader may search through its pages without any clue to guide him to the object of his inquiries. It is in this particular that the first rude essays towards a compilation of this kind are so extremely defective. The alphabet, in place of being employed in the humble function of an index to the matter contained in the work, was made supreme arbiter of the whole arrangement; and the different sciences, instead of following their natural order, were cut down into detached parts, out of which no great whole could possibly be formed. In this view the alphabet, far from conducing to clearness, became an instrument of disorder; and its only use appeared to be, to save the writers to whom we allude from the trouble of a more accurate or philosophical arrangement. Those obvious defects in all the most popular dictionaries of arts and sciences were observed by Mr Chambers, the compiler of a very valuable work of this kind himself; and, in speaking of the labours of his predecessors, he particularly censures the inattention to method, so visible in every part of their performances. \"Former lexicographers (he observes) scarce attempted any thing like structure in their works; they seem not to have been aware that a dictionary is in some measure capable of the advantages of a continued discourse; and hence it is, that we see nothing like a whole in what they have done.\" For the purpose of remedying this defect in his own work, he informs his readers, that \"his view was to consider the several matters, not only in themselves, but relatively, or as they respect each other; both to treat them as so many wholes, and as so many parts of some greater whole; and to point out their connection with each other, and with that whole, by reference: so that by a course of references from generals to particulars, from premises to conclusions, from cause to effect, and vice versa, a communication might be opened between the several parts of the work, and the detached articles be in some measure replaced in the natural order of science, out of which the alphabetical order had removed them.\" With a view of exhibiting a connected\nconnected view of the various articles scattered through his dictionary, Mr Chambers has accordingly prefixed to it an analysis, from which may be seen, at one view, the mutual connection and dependence of its various parts.\n\nBut although the arrangement of the Cyclopaedia of Mr Chambers is much preferable to that of any former work of the kind, it is still liable to many of those objections for which he censures his predecessors. Even if his original plan had been carried into effect with complete success, and all the articles in different parts of his work had been so managed, as, when reunited, to have made so many complete systems, the number of references was still so great that no reader could possibly have submitted to the trouble of combining them (A).\n\n---\n\n(A) To be convinced of the truth of this assertion, one needs but to cast his eye over the author's table of arrangement. It is as follows.\n\n| Sensible; consisting in the perception of phenomena or external objects\u2014called Physiology or Natural History; and which, according to the different kinds of such objects, divides into\u2014 |\n| --- | --- |\n| Or, | Powers, and Properties\u2014called Physics, and Natural Philosophy. |\n| Rational; consisting in the perception of the intrinsic characters or habits of sensible objects\u2014either their |\n| Quantities\u2014called Pure Mathematics\u2014which divides, according to the subject of Geometry\u2014whence Statics\u2014Conics\u2014Spherics. |\n| Relations to our happiness\u2014called Ethics, or Natural Politics, Religion, or the doctrine of Religion\u2014whence Law. Offices, which subdivides into Theology, or Revelation. |\n\n| Natural and Scientific; which is either\u2014 |\n| --- | --- |\n| Or, | Latent powers and properties of bodies\u2014called Chemistry\u2014whence Optics, Catoptrics, Dioptrics, Phonics\u2014whence Music, Hydrostatics, Hydraulics, Pneumatics. |\n| Artificial and Technicals (consisting in the application of natural notices to farther purposes), which is either\u2014 |\n| Quantities of bodies\u2014called Mixed Mathematics; which according to the different subjects, resolves into\u2014 |\n| Real, employed in discovering and applying the |\n| Structure and economy of organical bodies, called Anatomy. |\n| Relations thereof to the preservation and improvement either of\u2014 |\n| Animals\u2014called Medicine, Pharmacy. Vegetables\u2014called Agriculture, Gardening. Brutes\u2014called Faring, Man\u00e8ge\u2014whence Hunting, Falconry, Fishing, &c. |\n\n| External; which is either\u2014 |\n| --- | --- |\n| Or, | Symbolical, employed in framing and applying\u2014 |\n| Words, or articulate signs of ideas\u2014called Grammar. Armories\u2014called Heraldry. Tropes and Figures\u2014called Rhetoric. Fables\u2014called Poetry. |\n\n---\n\nSuch\nOf this inconvenience, inseparable from a mere dictionary of arts and sciences, the original compilers of the Encyclopaedia Britannica were fully aware; and they resolved, in the conduct of their work, to adopt such a plan as should completely free it from this objection. They were as fully convinced as their predecessors of the utility of a separate explanation of every technical term, and of the necessity also of noticing, in detail, many topics which it would be proper more fully to illustrate in the general account of the respective sciences to which they belonged. They were sensible, however, at the same time, how greatly the progress of useful knowledge is facilitated by systematical arrangement, and how necessary it is for those to think methodically who expect to benefit mankind by their labours. They have accordingly endeavoured, in place of the awkward expedient of a prefatory analysis, adopted by Mr Chambers, to exhibit a clear and satisfactory account of the several arts and sciences under their proper denominations, and to explain at the same time the subordinate articles under their technical terms. These articles may be divided into three kinds. The first consists of such as, not depending very closely on particular systems, admit of a complete explanation under their proper names; the second of such as require to be considered in the general account of the sciences with which they are connected, and also under their own denominations; and the third, of such as belong to a great whole, from which they cannot be separated, so as to be explained in detail. Articles of the first kind admit, of course, of no references; those of the second sort, being only partially explained under their own denominations, the reader is referred for more complete information to the article where the subject is more fully illustrated; and in articles of the third description, no attempt is made to explain them, except in connection with the subjects to which they severally belong, and to which the reader is therefore always referred.\n\nSuch is that great and general analysis of knowledge, which has by some of our correspondents been recommended to us in terms of the highest praise, and to which elegance and accuracy cannot perhaps be refused. Its utility, however, as prefixed to a dictionary of arts and sciences, is not very apparent. From each word, which in this table is printed in capitals, many branches are made to spring, which in the dictionary are all treated as separate articles. Thus, from Meteorology we are referred, in a subordinate analysis, to Air and the Atmosphere; including, 1st, The history of its contents, Ether, Fire, Vapour, Exhalation, &c. 2d, Meteors formed therein; as Cloud, Rain, Shower, Drop, Snow, Hail, Dew, Damp, &c. Rainbow, Parhelion, Halo, Thunder, Waterspout, &c. Winds, Monsoon, Hurricane, and the like. As every word printed in capitals, as well in this subordinate division as in the general table, is the title of an article treated separately in the Cyclop\u00e6dia, we must turn backwards and forwards through more than 24 references before we come at the detached topics, which we are directed to unite into a system of Meteorology. The number of articles which must be united in the same manner to constitute the Compiler's system of Metaphysics is upwards of 48; and those which are referred to Theology above 300!\nSuch is the arrangement adopted in every edition of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica; and there appears to be no other, by which the great object of such a work would be so easily and so completely attained. The necessary effect of such a plan must be, to give to readers of every description the most easy access to the objects of their various pursuits; for, whilst the philosopher or artist may procure whatever information he is in search of, by turning to the general name of the science to which his attention is directed, those who are desirous of information on particular topics will find them explained with sufficient accuracy under their respective denominations. Considered in this point of view, the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica may vie in the accuracy of its arrangement with the Encyclop\u00e9die Methodique; for though that voluminous work undoubtedly has an imposing appearance, yet we, who, in the course of our labours, have had to consult it frequently, have never found our object the more readily, for having been obliged to travel in quest of it through different alphabets.\n\nA dictionary, in which the several arts and sciences are digested into distinct treatises or systems, whilst the various detached parts of knowledge are explained in the order of the alphabet, seems indeed to have received the best form of which such a work is susceptible; and may certainly be made to answer one end, which more philosophical arrangements never can accomplish. Under the various letters of the alphabet, it is obvious that the whole circle of the sciences may be completely exhausted; and that every discovery, ancient or recent, may be referred to the particular system which it tends to confute or to confirm, without having recourse to the awkward expedient of employing several alphabets, or the still more inconvenient arrangement by which the systems themselves are broken into fragments.\n\nThe truth of these observations is confirmed beyond the possibility of doubt, by the favourable reception which every edition of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica has hitherto met with; by the still greater encouragement which has been given to the present; and by the circumstance of its plan having been invariably adopted by the editors of all similar works. On this subject, the proprietors of the present edition express themselves with the greater ease and confidence, as they cannot be accused of flattering their own vanity, or of being the publishers of their own praise. The merit of the arrangement, as well as of various other improvements suggested in the course of the work, belongs not so much to them, as to the compilers of the first edition.\nTo a work which proposes as its main object to exhibit a view of the Arts and Sciences, the private history of those eminent persons by whose ingenuity the progress of science has been promoted, seems to be a proper accompaniment. Those who formed the plan of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica resolved accordingly to improve it, by the addition of one department, not to be found in any former compilation of the kind, with the exception of the French Encyclop\u00e9die.\n\nOf all the various sorts of narrative-writing, it is acknowledged that none is more worthy of cultivation than Biography, since none can be more delightful or more useful; none can more certainly enchain the heart by irresistible interest, or more widely diffuse instruction to every diversity of condition. Its tendency to illustrate particular passages in general history, and to diffuse new light through such arts and sciences as were cultivated by the persons whose lives are related, are facts too obvious to require proof. It exhibits likewise the human character in every possible form and situation. It not only attends the hero through all the bustle of public life, but pursues him to his most sequestered retirements. It shows how distinguished characters have been involved in misfortunes and difficulties; by what means they were extricated; or with what degree of fortitude and dignity they discharged the various functions, or sustained the vicissitudes, sometimes prosperous and sometimes adverse, of a chequered and a fluctuating life. In such narratives, men of all ranks must feel themselves interested; for the high and the low, as they have the same faculties and the same senses, have no less similitude in their pains and pleasures; and, therefore, in the page of honest biography, those whom fortune or nature has placed at the greatest distance, may mutually afford instruction to each other. For these reasons it is, that every man of learning and taste has esteemed the biographical labours of Plutarch among the most valuable and interesting remains of antiquity.\n\nThe lives and characters, therefore, of such persons as have excelled in the arts either of war or of peace, of such as have distinguished themselves either on the theatre of action, or in the recess of contemplation, will be found in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica alphabetically disposed under their proper names. In former editions of this work, many names are omitted for which the reader will naturally look; some because the work had advanced beyond the initial letters of their names before the editor received intelligence of their deaths; others through inadvertency, and from various mistakes, against which it is difficult to provide in so extensive an undertaking,\ntaking; and several from the confusion occasioned by the death of the first editor in the midst of his labours. In the present edition, all these defects have been carefully rectified; and the proprietor may safely venture to assert, that it contains a more perfect biographical register than any which has hitherto been offered to the public. Some, indeed, may be disposed to remark, that this department of their work is executed with too great minuteness, and that the names of many persons are dragged from obscurity, who are not proper objects of public regard. To this we shall only reply, with the greatest biographer of modern times, that, in our apprehension, there has rarely passed a life of which a faithful narrative would not be useful; and that, in the lives of the most obscure persons of whom we have given any account, something will be found either connected with recent discoveries and public affairs, or capable of affording a useful lesson to those who may be placed in similar circumstances.\n\nBetween eminent achievements and the scenes where they were performed, there is a natural and necessary connexion. The character of the warrior is connected with the fields of his battles; that of the legislator, with the countries which he civilized; and that of the traveller and navigator, with the regions which they explored. Even when we read of the persons by whom, and the occasions on which, any particular branch of knowledge has been improved, we naturally wish to know something of the places where such improvements were made. This curiosity, so natural and so laudable, has been frequently felt by ourselves during the compilation of this work; and to gratify it in others, we have subjoined to the name of every considerable place an account of its situation, its climate, its soil, its peculiarities, its inhabitants, with the manners, customs, and arts; its revolutions, laws, and government, with whatever else appeared necessary for the reader's information, and at the same time admissible into a work of such variety and extent. It is indeed probable, that by many of our readers we shall be thought to have done too much rather than too little in this department; and to have filled our pages with accounts of towns and villages not of sufficient importance to demand general attention. But were it known how many of such places we have excluded from our work, though recommended to us by some of our most obliging correspondents, those who reflect upon the different tastes of mankind, and consider that we wrote for the public at large, would forgive us for having occasionally employed a few sentences in the description of others, which, whatever be their real importance, could not have been omitted without disappointing a very numerous class of readers.\nThe knowledge of history is so important, not only to the statesman and the legislator, to whom indeed it is absolutely necessary, but likewise to every man who moves in a sphere above that of the lowest vulgar, that a work professing to be a general repository of arts, sciences, and literature, would be exceedingly defective, if it did not contain some information of the transactions of those who have been in possession of the world before us; of the various revolutions of states and empires; and of all the other means which have contributed to bring every thing into the state in which we behold it. Fully aware of this, the compilers of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, besides giving a general view of universal history and chronology, have enriched this edition with a short, though they hope luminous, detail of the progress of each particular nation, which from the remotest period to the present time, has acted a conspicuous part on the theatre of the world. The reader therefore will here find a very comprehensive view of Civil History, ancient and modern, in all its branches. Nor have the histories of Nature and Religion been neglected. Of the former, it is not perhaps too much to say, that in all the subdivisions of its three great kingdoms, it will be found more fully, more accurately, and more scientifically, detailed in this work, than in any other dictionary which has yet been published. Of the latter, a brief view is given under the general article History; the unavoidable defects of which are in a great measure supplied by the accounts that will be found, under their proper denominations, of all the considerable sects and opinions which have prevailed in the religious world, from the earliest periods to the present day.\n\nFrom the original plan of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, which hardly seems capable of any improvement, the compilers of the present edition have, except in a very few instances, never deviated; and they can honestly assure their readers, that notwithstanding their adherence to this resolution, they have found ample scope for the exercise both of learning, and diligence in every sort of laborious research. This must necessarily be the case, indeed, in every succeeding edition of such a work as the present, which professes to follow the sciences and the arts through all their changes and refinements, and to present the most accurate view of the state of the world and of all its concerns at the period of each successive publication. This part of their duty, those concerned with the present edition have neither spared labour nor expense faithfully to discharge. Literary journals; the memoirs and transactions of philosophic societies; and all the most valuable dictionaries of arts and sciences, both in our own and in other languages,\nguages, have been constantly consulted. The works of the most eminent authors, as well ancient as modern, who have written on any particular art or science, have been collected and compared. Such of them as treat of topics, about which there is no room for controversy, and are at the same time susceptible of abridgement, have been abridged with the greatest care; whilst others, more concise and tenacious of their subjects, have been more closely pursued and more faithfully retained. Upon those branches of science on which the works of other authors furnished nothing fit for the purpose of the Editors, original essays and treatises are inserted, which were composed either by themselves, or by such of their friends as they knew to be intimately acquainted with the subject. On disputed points, whether in the physical or moral sciences, arguments and objections have been displayed in their full force; and of each of the various sects into which the Christian church is divided, the account is generally given by the most eminent clergymen of that sect to whom the Editors could find access.\n\nIn executing this part of their task, there were various circumstances connected with the history of the third edition, which greatly added to its difficulties. In so extensive and multifarious a collection, a few mistakes, repetitions, and omissions might naturally be looked for; although the publication were, from the beginning to the end, in the hands of a single individual. When it is known, however, that after the third and last edition of this work was considerably advanced, it was committed to the care of a new editor, ignorant of the contents of what had been already finished and printed, and without any directions from his predecessor to guide him accurately through the remaining part of his task; it will not, perhaps, appear very surprising that inaccuracies, omissions, and repetitions should have occurred. For these defects, the want of an intelligible index to the materials left by the first editor is the best apology, and it was owing to the want of such a necessary guide that Dr Gleig, the second editor, was perpetually liable, notwithstanding the utmost circumspection, to give, under one title, an explanation of subjects which had before been explained under another; and to omit articles altogether, from a persuasion, sufficiently natural in the circumstance in which he was placed, that they had been discussed in some preceding volume under the general system to which they belong.\n\nWe are far from wondering at, or from censuring these imperfections in the last edition. At the same time we may be permitted to observe, that\nthey contributed greatly to add to the difficulties of the present editor; since it was absolutely necessary, in order to preserve the unity and consistency of the work, diligently to examine and to compare all those parts of the former edition in which there was any thing unsuitable to the general plan, or in which any interesting information was omitted.\n\nIn executing this part of his task, the Editor has encountered many difficulties; but he can truly say he has spared no pains, whether by addition or arrangement, to overcome them, and to present to the public a finished work. For this purpose, he has also availed himself of the valuable information contained in the two supplementary volumes to the third edition, conducted under the inspection of Dr Gleig, which, joined to the more recent improvements of science, he has new-modelled and arranged for the present work.\n\nAs it may be satisfactory to the reader to learn by whose assistance the Encyclopaedia Britannica has been brought to its present state of perfection, the following list is subjoined, which the Editor flatters himself will be found to contain the names of various writers eminent for their proficiency in different departments of literature and science.\n\nFor whatever instruction may be contained under the articles Anatomy, the public is indebted to the late Andrew Bell, F. S. S. A., the proprietor, who had devoted a great portion of his time and attention to the study of anatomy, and to the ingenious Mr Fife, who has practised for many years under Dr Monro, as dissector in the anatomical school of the University; and the whole article Surgery has been written anew by Mr James Wardrope, surgeon in London.\n\nThe articles Aerology, Aerostation, Chemistry, Electricity, Gunnery, Hydrostatics, Mechanics, Meteorology, Mineralogy, with most of the separate articles in the various branches of Natural History, we have reason to believe were originally compiled by the late Mr James Tytler, chemist, but many of them have been entirely re-written, and the others accommodated to the present improved state of these sciences, by Dr James Millar, who superintended the editing of the present work, Dr Kirby, and Dr Brewster of Edinburgh, and Professor Muirhead of Glasgow.\n\nThe article Blind was furnished by the late Dr Blacklock and Dr Moyes, both men of superior attainments, the former in elegant literature, and the latter in the physical sciences.\n\nAstronomy and Navigation were compiled, the one by Dr Thomas Thomson, and the other by Dr Andrew Mackay; and the articles Algebra, Conic Sections,\nSections; Trigonometry, and several others in the mathematical and physical sciences were furnished by Mr William Wallace of the Royal Military College, Great Marlow.\n\nThe lives of Johnson and Mary Queen of Scots, with the articles Instinct, Love, Metaphysics, Miracle, the history of Ethics under Moral Philosophy, Oath, Passion, Plastic Nature, Polytheism, Prayer, Slavery, and Supper of the Lord, were contributed by the Right Reverend Bishop Gleig of Stirling, editor of the last six volumes of the former edition; Grammar and Theology by Dr Gleig and the Reverend James Bruce, A.B. late of Emanuel College, Cambridge; and Motion by Dr Gleig. The system of Medicine, which was published in the former edition, was revised and improved for the present by Andrew Duncan, M.D., Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and Professor of the Institutes of Physic in the University.\n\nThe article Music was furnished by Dr Blacklock for the third edition, and has been considerably improved for the present by Mr George Sandy, writer to the signet, and William Maxwell Morison, Esq. advocate, to the latter of whom the Editor is also indebted for what we have published on the science of Physiognomy. The articles Mysteries, Mythology, and Philology, we owe to the erudition of the late Dr David Doig, master of the grammar school of Stirling, and author of two very ingenious Letters on the Savage State, addressed to the late Lord Kames.\n\nNavigation, Parallax, Pendulum, Projection of the Sphere, and Ship-Building, were furnished by the late Andrew Mackay, L.L.D., long known to the public as an able mathematician; and the article War, including Naval Tactics, by Dr Kirby.\n\nIn the former edition, the valuable articles Physics, Pneumatics, Precession of the Equinoxes, Projectiles, Pumps, Resistance of Fluids, River, Rotation, Seamanship, Signals, Sound, Specific Gravity, Statics, Steam and Steam Engine, Strength of Materials, Telescope, Tide, Articulating Trumpet, Variation of the Compass, and Water-Works, were originally written by Professor John Robison. These articles have not been materially altered in the present edition; and to those who are at all acquainted with the various and original acquirements of that author, it is altogether unnecessary to enter particularly into their merits.\n\nPhilosophy is the joint production of Professor Robison and Dr Gleig. Physiology was furnished by John Barclay, M.D. of Edinburgh, and Midwifery by Dr James Hamilton, junior. For a continuation of the History of\nof India, the editor is indebted to Dr William Tennant, who resided long in that country. The articles Political Economy and Taxation are written by Mr Hugh Murray; Gardening by Mr James Williamson; and an account of Boscovich's system of Natural Philosophy by Dr Poole. We know that much useful information had been communicated by Dr Latham of Dartford in Kent, the celebrated ornithologist; by Dr William Wright, physician-general to the forces in the West Indies under the command of Sir Ralph Abercromby; by the Reverend J. Hawkins, vicar of Halsted in Essex; by the late Mr Adams, mathematical instrument maker to his Majesty; and by Mr William Jones, optician in Holborn, London.\n\nWith every disposition to acknowledge the very able assistance with which we have been favoured in the prosecution of this important undertaking, we are still sensible, that it is wholly out of our power to particularize every one to whom we are indebted. To enter into any detail of the reasons which prevent us from making this particular acknowledgment is wholly unnecessary. We may mention, however, one circumstance, which would of itself have prevented us from being so minute in this particular as we might have wished, namely, the death of Mr Bell, the late proprietor, before the work was finished; to whose great exertions in forwarding this publication, as well as to his zeal in the general cause of science, all those who had the pleasure of his acquaintance can bear witness. While delicacy, however, prevents us from enlarging on this topic, we hope the reader will excuse this tribute of respect to the memory of an estimable character; and that the apology we have made will, at the same time, be deemed satisfactory by those, whose assistance, in the course of the publication, we are in this manner prevented from properly acknowledging.\n\nEdinburgh, July 1810.","sp":598,"ep":610},{"h":"SCHOLIUM","t":"Let one of the six parts of any spherical triangle be neglected; let the one opposite to it, or its supplement, if an angle, be called the middle part, the two next to it the adjacent parts, and the remaining two the opposite parts.

I.\n\nIn a right-angled plane triangle, as the hypotenuse is to either of the sides, so is the radius to the fine of the angle opposite to that side; and as either of the sides to the other side, so is the radius to the tangent of the angle opposite to that side.\n\nLet ABC be a right-angled plane triangle (fig. 3.), of which AC is the hypotenuse. On A as a centre with any radius, describe the arch DE; draw EG at right angles to AB, and draw DF touching the circle at D, and meeting AC in F. Then EG is the fine of the angle A to the radius AD or AE, and DF is its tangent.\n\nThe triangles AGE, ADF are manifestly similar to the triangle ABC. Therefore AC : CB :: AE : EG; that is, AC : CB :: rad : fin. A.\n\nAgain,\nAgain, \\( AB : BC :: AD : DF \\); that is \\( AB : BC :: \\tan A \\).\n\nCor. In a right-angled triangle, as the hypotenuse to either of the sides, so is the secant of the acute angle adjacent to that side to the radius. For \\( AF \\) is the secant of the angle \\( A \\) to the radius \\( AD \\); and \\( AC : AB :: AF : AD \\), that is, \\( AC : AB :: \\sec A : \\tan A \\).\n\nNote. This proposition is most easily remembered when stated thus. If in a right-angled triangle the hypotenuse be made the radius, the sides become the sines of the opposite angles; and if one of the sides be made the radius, the other side becomes the tangent of the opposite angle, and the hypotenuse its secant.\n\n**Theor. II.**\n\nThe sides of a plane triangle are to one another as the sines of the opposite angles.\n\nFrom \\( B \\) any angle of the triangle \\( ABC \\) (fig. 4.), draw \\( BD \\) perpendicular to \\( AC \\).

III.**\n\nThe sum of any two sides of a triangle is to their difference as the tangent of half the sum of the angles opposite to these sides to the tangent of half their difference.\n\nLet \\( ABC \\), fig. 5., be a triangle; \\( AB + BC : AB - BC :: \\tan \\frac{1}{2} (\\angle BCA + \\angle BAC) : \\tan \\frac{1}{2} (\\angle BCA - \\angle BAC) \\).\n\nIn \\( AB \\) produced take \\( BE = BC \\), and on \\( B \\) as a centre with \\( BC \\) or \\( BE \\) as a radius, describe the semicircle \\( ECF \\) meeting \\( AC \\) in \\( D \\); join \\( BD, CF, \\) and \\( CE \\), and from \\( F \\) draw \\( FG \\) parallel to \\( AC \\), meeting \\( CE \\) in \\( G \\).\n\nBecause the angles \\( CFE, CBE, \\) stand on the same arc \\( CE \\), and the former is at the circumference of the circle, and the latter at the centre; therefore, the angle \\( CFE \\) is half the angle \\( CBE \\) (Geometry, Sect.

IV.**\n\nIf a perpendicular be drawn from any angle of a triangle to the opposite side or base; the sum of the segments of the base is to the sum of the other two sides as the difference of these sides to the difference of the segments of the base.\n\nLet \\( ABC \\) be a triangle (fig. 6.), and \\( BD \\) a perpendicular drawn to the base from the opposite angle; \\( AD + DC : AB + BC :: AB - BC : AD - DC \\).\n\nOn, \\( B \\) as a centre with the radius \\( BC \\), describe a circle meeting \\( AC \\) in \\( E \\), and \\( AB \\) in \\( G \\), and the same line produced in \\( F \\).

(See Theor. III.)\n\n\\[ AC + CB : AC - CB :: \\tan \\frac{1}{2}(B + A) : \\tan \\frac{1}{2}(B - A). \\]\n\nHaving now the sum and difference of the angles B and A, the angles will be found by the rule given in the problem following Theor.

As we now know all the angles and two sides, the remaining side may be found by Case 1.\n\n**Case 4.** The three sides AB, BC and AC (fig. 10.) being given, to find the three angles A, B, C.\n\n**Solution.** Let fall a perpendicular CD upon the greatest of the three sides from the opposite angle. Then find the difference between AD and DB by this proportion.\n\n\\[ AB : AC + CB :: AC - CB : AD - DB. \\]\n\nThe segments AD, DB may now be found severally by the rule given for finding each of the quantities whose sum and difference is given, and then the angles A and B may be found by the following proportions.\n\n\\[ CA : AD :: \\text{rad.} : \\cos A, \\]\n\\[ CB : BD :: \\text{rad.} : \\cos B. \\]\n\nThe angles A, B being found, C of course is known. The first part of this solution follows from Theor. IV. The latter part from Theor. I.\n\n**Example.** Let AB be 125, AC 105, and BC 95. Required the angles.\n\nIn this case AC + BC = 200, AC - BC = 10, therefore we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{125}{200} :: \\frac{10}{AD - DB} = \\frac{200 \\times 10}{125} = 16.\n\\]\n\nNow AD + DB = 125, therefore AD = 70.5 DB = 54.5.\n\n---\n\n**Spherical Trigonometry**\n\n**SECTION III.**\n\n**SPHERICAL TRIGONOMETRY.**\n\n**Theor. I.**\n\nIf a sphere be cut by a plane through the centre, the section is a circle.\n\nThe truth of this proposition is evident from the definition of a sphere. See Geometry, Sect. IX. Def. 3.\n\n**Definitions.**\n\nI. Any circle which is a section of a sphere by a plane passing through its centre, is called a great circle of the sphere.\n\nCor. All great circles of a sphere are equal, and the centre of the sphere is their common centre, and any two of them bisect one another.\n\nII. The pole of a great circle of the sphere is a point in the superficies of the sphere from which all straight lines drawn to the circumference of the circle are equal.\n\nIII. A spherical angle is that which on the superficies of a sphere is contained by two arches of great circles, and is the same with the inclination of the planes of these great circles.\n\nIV. A spherical triangle is a figure upon the superficies of a sphere comprehended by three arches of three great circles, each of which is less than a semicircle.\n\n**Theor. II.**\n\nThe arch of a great circle between the pole and the circumference of another circle is a quadrant.\n\nLet ABC be a great circle, (fig. 11.) and D its pole; let the great circle ADC pass through D, and let AEC be the common section of the planes of the two circles, which will pass through E the centre of the circle; join DA, DC. Because the chord DA is equal to the chord DC, (Def. 2.) the arch DA is equal to the arch DC; now ADC is a semicircle, therefore the arches AD and DC are quadrants.\n\nCor. 1. If DE be drawn, the angle AED is a right angle, and DE being therefore at right angles to every line it meets with in the plane of the circle ABC, is at right angles to that plane. Therefore the straight line drawn from the pole of any great circle to the centre of the sphere is at right angles to the plane of that circle.\n\nCor. 2. The circle has two poles D, D', one on each\nSpherical each side of its plane, which are the extremities of a diameter of the sphere perpendicular to the plane ABC.\n\n**Theor. III.**\n\nA spherical angle is measured by the arch of a great circle intercepted between the great circles containing the angle, and having the angular point for its pole.\n\nLet AB, AC be two arches of great circles containing the spherical angle BAC; let BC be an arch of a great circle intercepted between them, and having A for its pole, and let BD, CD, AD be drawn to D the centre of the sphere. The arches AB, AC are quadrants, (Theor. II.), and therefore the angles ADB, ADC right angles; therefore (Geometry, Sect. VII. Def. 4.), the angle BDC (which is measured by the arch BC) is the inclination of the planes of the circles BDA, CDA, and is equal to the spherical angle BAC (Def. 3.).\n\nCor. If AB, AC two arches of great circles meet in A, then A shall be the pole of a great circle passing through B and C.\n\n**Theor. IV.**\n\nTwo great circles whose planes are perpendicular pass through each other's poles.\n\nLet ACBD, AEBF be two great circles, the planes of which are at right angles to one another; from G the centre of the sphere, draw GC in the plane ABCD perpendicular to AB, then GC is also perpendicular to the plane AEBF, (Geometry, Sect. VII. Theor. 12.), therefore C is the pole of the circle AEBF, and if CG be produced to D, D is the other pole of the circle AEBF.\n\nIn the same manner, by drawing GE in the plane AEBF perpendicular to AB, and producing it to F, it is shewn that E and F are the poles of the circle ABCD.\n\nCor. 1. If two great circles pass through each other's poles, their planes are perpendicular to one another.\n\nCor. 2. If of two great circles the first passes through the poles of the second, the second also passes through the poles of the first.\n\n**Theor. V.**\n\nIf the angular points of any spherical triangle be made the poles of three great circles, another triangle will be formed by their intersections, such, that the sides of the one triangle will be respectively the supplements of the measures of the angles opposite to them in the other.\n\nLet the angular points of the triangle ABC be the poles of three great circles; which by their intersections form the three lunar surfaces DQ, FR, and EO; A being the pole of EF, B the pole of DF, and C the pole of ED. Then the triangle DEF which is common to three lunar surfaces will be in every respect supplemental to the triangle ABC.\n\nFor let each side of ABC be produced to meet the spherical sides that contain the angle opposite to it, in the triangle DEF; then, because BC passes through the poles of ED, DF, ED, DF must also pass through the poles of BC, (Theor. II. Cor. 2.). Therefore the points D, Q are the poles of BC. In like manner R, F are the poles of AB, and E, O the poles of AC. Hence EL, FK are quadrants, (Theor. II.), and therefore EF is the supplement of KL, but since A is the pole of EF, KL is the measure of the angle at A; thus EF is the supplement of the measure of the angle at A. In like manner FD is the supplement of the measure of the angle at B, and DE the supplement of the measure of the angle at C.\n\nFurther, it will appear in the same manner that BC is the supplement of HM, the measure of the angle at D; that AB is the supplement of NK the measure of the angle at F; and that AC is the supplement of GL, the measure of the angle at E.\n\n**Theor. VI.**\n\nIf from any point E, which is not the pole of the great circle ABC, there be drawn arches of great circles EA, EK, EB, &c. the greatest of these is EGA, which passes through G the pole of ABC, and EC the remainder of the semicircle is the least, and of the other, EK, EB, &c. EK, which is nearer to EA is greater than EB, which is more remote.\n\nLet AC be the common section of the planes of the great circles AEC, ABC; draw EH perpendicular to AC, which will be perpendicular to the plane of the circle ABC (Geometry, Sect. VII. Theor. XII.) and join AE, KE, BE, KH, BH. Then of all the straight lines drawn from H to the circumference, HA is the greatest, HC the least, and HK greater than HB: Therefore in the right-angled triangles EHA, EH, EHB, EHC, which have the side EH common, EA is the greatest hypotenuse, EC the least, and EK greater than EB, consequently the arch EGA is the greatest, EC the least and EK greater than EB.\n\n**Theor. VII.**\n\nAny two sides of a spherical triangle are together greater than the third, and all the three sides are together less than a circle.\n\nLet ABC be a spherical triangle, let D be the centre of the sphere, join DA, DB, DC. The solid angle at D is contained by three plane angles ADB, BDC, ADC, any two of which are greater than the third, (Geometry, Sect. VII. Theor. XV.) and therefore any two of the arches AB, BC, AC which measure these angles must be greater than the third arch.\n\nTo prove the second part of the proposition, produce the sides AB, AC until they meet again in E; then ECA and EBA are semicircles; now CB is less than CE + EB, therefore CB + CA + BA is less than CE + EB + CA + BA, but these four arches make up two semicircles; therefore CB + CA + BA is less than a circle.\n**Theor. VIII.**\n\nIf two sides of a spherical triangle be equal, the angles opposite to them are equal, and conversely.\n\nIn the triangle \\(ABC\\), if the sides \\(AB, AC\\) be equal, the angles \\(ABC, ACB\\) are also equal. If \\(AB, AC\\) be quadrants, \\(ABC, ACB\\) are right angles. If not, let the tangent to the side \\(AB\\) at \\(B\\) meet \\(EA\\) the line of common section of the planes \\(AB, AC\\) in \\(F\\), and let the tangents to the base \\(BC\\) at its extremities meet each other in \\(G\\); also, let \\(FC, FG, EC,\\) and \\(EB\\) be joined. Then the triangles \\(FEB, FEC\\) have \\(FE\\) common, \\(EB = EC\\), and the angle \\(AEB = AEC\\), therefore \\(FB = FC\\), and the angle \\(FCE = FBE\\) a right angle; hence \\(FC\\) is a tangent, and the triangles \\(FGB, GCF\\) are mutually equilateral, therefore the angle \\(FBG = FCG\\) and consequently the spherical angle \\(\\hat{ABC} = \\hat{ACB}\\).\n\nAgain, if the angles \\(ABC, ACB\\) be equal, the side \\(AB = AC\\). For if in fig. 14, the angle \\(ABC\\) be equal to \\(ACB\\), the side \\(DF\\) of the supplemental triangle \\(DEF\\) will be equal to the side \\(DE\\) (Theor. V.), therefore the angle \\(DEF = DFE\\), and consequently in the triangle \\(ABC\\), the side \\(AC = AB\\) by Theorem V.\n\nCor. In any triangle the greater angle is subtended by the greater side; and conversely. For if the angle \\(ACB\\) be greater than \\(ABC\\) (fig. 18), let \\(BCD = ABC\\), then \\(BD = DC\\), and \\(AB + AD + DC\\), which is greater than \\(AC\\) (Theor. VII.). The converse is demonstrated in the same manner as the like property of plane triangles, (Geometry, Sect. I. Theor. XIII.).\n\n**Theor. IX.**\n\nAll the angles of a spherical triangle are together greater than two, and less than six right angles.\n\nIn the triangle \\(ABC\\) (fig. 14.) the three angles are together less than six right angles, because when added to the three exterior angles they only make six; and they are greater than two right angles, because their measures \\(GH, KL, MN\\), added to \\(DE, EF, FD\\), are equal to three semicircles; and \\(DE, EF, FD\\) being less than two semicircles (Theor. VII.) \\(GH, KL, MN\\) must be greater than one.\n\n**Theor. X.**\n\nAny two angles of a spherical triangle are together greater, equal, or less than two right angles, according as the sum of the opposite sides is greater, equal, or less than a semicircle; and conversely.\n\nLet the sides \\(AB, AC\\) (fig. 19.) of the spherical triangle \\(ABC\\) be produced to meet in \\(D\\); then it is evident that according as the sum of \\(AB, BC\\) is greater, equal, or less than the semicircle \\(ABD\\), the side \\(BC\\) will be greater, equal, or less than \\(BD\\); the angle \\(D\\) or \\(A\\) will be greater, equal, or less than \\(BCD\\), and the sum of the angles \\(BAC, BCA\\) greater, equal, or less than the sum of \\(BCA, BCD\\), which is two right angles.\n\nCor. According as half the sum of any two sides of a spherical triangle is greater, equal, or less than a quadrant, half the sum of the opposite angles will be greater, equal, or less than a right angle.\n\n**Theor. XI.**\n\nIn a right-angled triangle, according as either of the sides about the right angle is greater, equal, or less than a quadrant, its opposite angle is greater, equal, or less than a right angle; and conversely.\n\nLet \\(ABC\\) (fig. 20.) be a triangle right-angled at \\(B\\), Fig. 20., and let the sides \\(AB, BC\\) be produced to meet in \\(D\\); then, because they pass through each other's poles, \\(E\\) the middle point of \\(BAD\\) will be the pole of \\(BCD\\); let a great circle pass through the points \\(CE\\). The arch \\(EC\\) is a quadrant, and the angle \\(ECB\\) a right angle. Now it is plain, that according as \\(AB\\) is greater, equal, or less than the quadrant \\(EB\\), the opposite angle \\(ACB\\) will be greater, equal, or less than the right angle \\(ECB\\), and conversely.\n\nCor. 1. If the two sides be both greater, or both less than quadrants, the hypotenuse will be less than a quadrant; but if the one be greater and the other less, the hypotenuse will be greater than a quadrant, and conversely.\n\nFor in the triangles \\(ABC, ADC\\), right-angled at \\(B, D\\), in which the sides \\(AB, BC\\) are less, and consequently \\(AD, DC\\) greater than quadrants, the hypotenuse \\(AC\\) is less than a quadrant, because it is nearer to \\(CB\\) than the quadrant \\(CE\\). But in the triangle \\(ABC\\), of which the side \\(AB\\) is greater, and \\(BC\\) less than a quadrant, the hypotenuse \\(AC\\) is greater than a quadrant, because it is further from \\(CB\\) than \\(CE\\) is.\n\nCor. 2. In every spherical triangle, of which the two sides are not both quadrants, if the perpendicular from the vertex fall within, the angles at the base will be both acute or both obtuse; but if it fall without, the one will be obtuse, and the other acute; and conversely.\n\n**Theor. XII.**\n\nIn any right-angled spherical triangle, as radius is to the fine of the hypotenuse, so is the fine of one of the oblique angles to the fine of its opposite side.\n\nLet \\(ABC\\) (fig. 21.) be a spherical triangle, having Fig. 21. a right angle at \\(B\\); and let \\(AD, BD, CD\\) be drawn to the centre of the sphere. From \\(C\\), in the plane \\(DCA\\), let \\(CE\\) be drawn perpendicular to \\(DA\\), and from \\(E\\), in the plane \\(DBA\\), draw \\(EF\\) perpendicular to the same line, and let \\(CF\\) be joined. Then because \\(DA\\) is perpendicular to the two lines \\(CE, EF\\), it is perpendicular to the plane \\(CEF\\), and consequently the plane \\(CEF\\) is perpendicular to the plane \\(DBA\\); but the plane \\(DCB\\) is also perpendicular to \\(DBA\\); therefore their line of common section \\(CF\\) is perpendicular to the same: Hence \\(CFD, CFE\\) are right angles. Now in the right-angled triangle \\(CFE\\), rad. : \\(CE ::\\) fin. \\(E : CF\\); but the angle \\(CEF\\), being the inclination of the planes \\(DCA, DBA\\), is the same with the spherical angle \\(CAB\\), \\(CE\\) is the fine of \\(AC\\), and \\(CF\\) the fine of \\(BC\\); therefore rad. : fin. \\(AC ::\\) fin. \\(A :\\) fin. \\(BC\\).\nCor. 1. As radius to the cosine of either of the sides, so is the cosine of the other to the cosine of the hypotenuse.\n\nFor let the great circle of which A is the pole, meet the three sides in D, E, F; then F is the pole of AD; and applying this proposition to the complementary triangle FCE, rad.: fin. FC :: fin. F : fin. CE; that is, rad.: cof. BC :: cof. AB : cof. AC.\n\nCor. 2. As radius to the cosine of one of the sides, so is the sine of its adjacent angle to the cosine of the other angle.\n\nTheor. XIII.\n\nIn any right-angled triangle, as radius to the sine of one of the sides, so is the tangent of the adjacent angle to the tangent of the other side.\n\nFrom B let BE be drawn perpendicular to DA, and from E, EF also perpendicular to DA, in the plane DCA, to meet DC in F, and let BF be joined. It may be shown as in the preceding proposition, that FB is perpendicular to the plane DBA; hence FB is the tangent of BC, and FBE is a right-angled triangle; therefore rad.: EB :: tan. E : FB; that is rad.: fin. AB :: tan. A : tan. BC.\n\nCor. 1. As radius to the cosine of the hypotenuse, so is the tangent of one of the angles to the cotangent of the other. For, in the complementary triangle FCE, (fig. 22.) rad.: fin. CE :: tan. C : tan. FE, that is, rad.: cof. AC :: tan. C : cot. A, or rad.: cof. AC :: tan. A : cot. C.\n\nCor. 2.

Any one of these being considered as the middle part, let the two which are next to it be called the adjacent parts, and the remaining two the opposite parts. Then the two preceding theorems, with their corollaries, may be all expressed in one proposition adapted to practice, as follows.\n\nIn any right-angled spherical triangle, the rectangle under radius, and the cosine of the middle part, is equal to the rectangle under the cotangents of the adjacent parts, or to the rectangle under the sines of the opposite parts.\n\nCase 1. Let the hypotenuse AC be the middle part.\n\nThen, rad.: cof. AC :: tan. C : cot. A (Theor. 13., Cor. 1.).\n\nTherefore (rad.: tan. C ::) cot. C : rad. :: cof. AC : cot. A.\n\nAnd rad.: cof.

BC.\n\nAnd (Theor. 12.) rad.: fin. AC :: fin. C : fin. AB.\n\nWe are indebted for the foregoing rule to Napier, the celebrated inventor of logarithms. It comprehends all the propositions which are necessary for the solution of right-angled triangles, and being easily remembered, is perhaps one of the happiest instances of artificial memory that is known.\n\nTheor. XIV.\n\nIn any spherical triangle, the sines of the sides are proportional to the sines of the opposite angle.\n\nThis proposition has been demonstrated in the case of right-angled triangles. Let ABC be any oblique-angled triangle, divided into two right-angled triangles, ABD, CBD, by the perpendicular BD, falling from the vertex upon the base AC. In the former, the complement of BD being the middle part, rad. \u00d7 fin. BD = fin. AB \u00d7 fin. A, (Napier's Rule). In the latter, the complement of BD being the middle part, rad. \u00d7 fin. BD = fin. BC \u00d7 fin. C. Hence fin. AB \u00d7 fin. A = fin. BC \u00d7 fin. C, and fin. AB : fin. BC :: fin. C : fin. A.\n\nCor. 1. The cosines of the two sides are to one another directly as the cosines of the segments of the base. This is proved by making AB, BC the middle part.\n\nCor. 2. The tangents of the two sides are to one another inversely as the cosines of the vertical angles. This will follow from making the angles ABD, CBD the middle parts.\n\nLemma 1. The sum of the tangents of two arches is to their difference, as the rectangle under the sine and cosine of half their sum to the rectangle under the sine and cosine of half their difference.\n\nFor, putting a and b for any two arches, by the arithmetic of sines (Algebra, \u00a7 353.), Sin. a cof. b + cof. a fin. b = fin. (a + b).\n\nLet each side of this equation be divided by cof. a cof. b, and we get\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{fin. } a}{\\text{cof. } a} + \\frac{\\text{fin. } b}{\\text{cof. } b} = \\frac{\\text{fin. } (a + b)}{\\text{fin. } a \\text{ cof. } b}\n\\]\n\nthat is, tan. a + tan. b = \\(\\frac{\\text{fin. } (a + b)}{\\text{fin. } a \\text{ cof. } b}\\).\n\nIn like manner, from the formula fin. (a - b) = fin. a cof. b - cof. a fin. b, we get\n\ntan. a - tan. b = \\(\\frac{\\text{fin. } (a - b)}{\\text{fin. } a \\text{ cof. } b}\\),\n\ntherefore tan. a + tan. b : tan. a - tan. b : fin. (a + b) : fin. (a - b), and remarking that fin. (a + b) = \\(2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} (a + b)\\).\nLemma 2. The sum of the fines of two arches is to their difference, as the rectangle under the fine of half the sum and cosine of half the difference of these arches is to the rectangle under the fine of half the difference and cosine of half the sum.\n\nFor it has been shown in the arithmetic of fines (Algebra, \u00a7 355), that\n\n\\[\n\\sin(p+q) + \\sin(p-q) = 2 \\sin p \\cos q,\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin(p+q) - \\sin(p-q) = 2 \\cos p \\sin q.\n\\]\n\nLet \\(p = \\frac{a}{2} + \\frac{b}{2}\\), and \\(q = \\frac{a}{2} - \\frac{b}{2}\\), so that \\(p+q = a\\) and \\(p-q = b\\); then these formulas become\n\n\\[\n\\sin a + \\sin b = 2 \\sin \\frac{a+b}{2} \\cos \\frac{a-b}{2},\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin a - \\sin b = 2 \\cos \\frac{a+b}{2} \\sin \\frac{a-b}{2}.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, \\(\\sin a + \\sin b : \\sin a - \\sin b :: \\sin \\frac{a+b}{2} \\cos \\frac{a-b}{2} : \\cos \\frac{a+b}{2} \\sin \\frac{a-b}{2}\\).\n\nLemma 3. The sum of the fines of two arches is to their difference, as the tangent of half the sum of these arches is to the tangent of half their difference.\n\nFor dividing the latter antecedent and consequent of the proportion in the foregoing lemma by \\(\\cos \\frac{a+b}{2} \\cos \\frac{a-b}{2}\\), we have \\(\\sin a + \\sin b : \\sin a - \\sin b :: \\tan \\frac{a+b}{2} : \\tan \\frac{a-b}{2}\\); that is, because \\(\\tan \\frac{a+b}{2} = \\frac{\\sin \\frac{a+b}{2}}{\\cos \\frac{a+b}{2}}\\) and \\(\\tan \\frac{a-b}{2} = \\frac{\\sin \\frac{a-b}{2}}{\\cos \\frac{a-b}{2}}\\).\n\nLemma 4. The sum of the cosines of two arches is to their difference, as the cotangent of half the sum of these arches is to the tangent of half their difference.\n\nBy Arithmetic of fines (Algebra, \u00a7 355),\n\n\\[\n\\cos(p+q) + \\cos(p-q) = 2 \\cos p \\cos q,\n\\]\n\\[\n\\cos(p+q) - \\cos(p-q) = 2 \\sin p \\sin q.\n\\]\n\nLet \\(p = \\frac{b+a}{2}\\) and \\(q = \\frac{b-a}{2}\\), then \\(p+q = a\\) and \\(p-q = b\\); and the two formulas become\n\n\\[\n\\cos a + \\cos b = 2 \\cos \\frac{b+a}{2} \\cos \\frac{b-a}{2},\n\\]\n\\[\n\\cos a - \\cos b = 2 \\sin \\frac{b+a}{2} \\sin \\frac{b-a}{2}.\n\\]\n\nHence, \\(\\cos a + \\cos b : \\cos a - \\cos b :: \\cos \\frac{b+a}{2} : \\cos \\frac{b-a}{2}\\);\n\nand dividing the latter antecedent and consequent by \\(\\cos \\frac{b+a}{2} \\cos \\frac{b-a}{2}\\),\n\n\\[\n\\cos a + \\cos b : \\cos a - \\cos b :: \\cos \\frac{b+a}{2} : \\cos \\frac{b-a}{2},\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin \\frac{b-a}{2} : \\sin \\frac{b+a}{2}, \\text{ that is, because } \\cot \\frac{b+a}{2} = \\frac{\\cos \\frac{b+a}{2}}{\\sin \\frac{b+a}{2}} \\text{ and } \\cot \\frac{b-a}{2} = \\frac{\\cos \\frac{b-a}{2}}{\\sin \\frac{b-a}{2}}.\n\\]\n\nIn the demonstration of the remaining theorems, we shall put A, B for the angles A and B at the base of the spherical triangle ACB (fig. 26), a and b for the sides opposite to these angles, p and q for the segments of the base BD, AD made by the perpendicular arch CD, P and Q for the vertical angles BCD, ACD; we shall also put s for \\(\\frac{1}{2}(a+b)\\), d for \\(\\frac{1}{2}(a-b)\\), s' for \\(\\frac{1}{2}(p+q)\\), d' for \\(\\frac{1}{2}(p-q)\\), S for \\(\\frac{1}{2}(A+B)\\), D for \\(\\frac{1}{2}(A-B)\\), S' for \\(\\frac{1}{2}(P+Q)\\), and D' for \\(\\frac{1}{2}(P-Q)\\).\n\nTheorem XV.\n\nIn any spherical triangle, the tangent of half the sum of the segments of the base is to the tangent of half the sum of the two sides, as the tangent of half their difference to the tangent of half the difference of the segments of the base.\n\nFor by Theorem XIV. Cor. 1. \\(\\cos a : \\cos b :: \\cos p : \\cos q\\); therefore, \\(\\cos a + \\cos b : \\cos a - \\cos b :: \\cos p + \\cos q : \\cos p - \\cos q\\), hence (Lemma 4.) \\(\\cot s : \\tan d :: \\cot s' : \\tan d'\\), or \\(\\cot s : \\cot s' :: \\tan d : \\tan d'\\); but \\(\\cot s : \\cot s' :: \\tan s : \\tan s'\\), therefore, \\(\\tan s : \\tan s' :: \\tan d : \\tan d'\\). This proposition expressed in words at length is the theorem to be demonstrated.\n\nTheorem XVI.\n\nThe cotangent of half the sum of the vertical angles and the tangent of half their difference, or the cotangent of half their difference and the tangent of half their sum, according as the perpendiculars fall within or without, are reciprocally proportional to the tangents of half the sum and half the difference of the angles at the base.\n\nFor, taking the case in which the perpendicular CD Fig. 27. (fig. 27,) falls within, let EFG be the supplemental triangle, let the arches GE, GF meet again in L, and produce CA, CB to meet EF in H and K. Because G and L are the poles of AB, the perpendicular CD, if produced, will pass through G and L; let it meet EF in I; then, because C is the pole of EF, the arch GCI is perpendicular to EF, and since E is the pole of BC, KE = quadrant = FH, and EH = KE, and IF = IE = IK = IH. In the triangle LEF, by the preceding proposition, \\(\\tan \\frac{1}{2}(FI+IE) : \\tan \\frac{1}{2}(FI-IE) :: \\tan \\frac{1}{2}(FL+LE) : \\tan \\frac{1}{2}(FL-LE)\\); \\(\\tan \\frac{1}{2}(FI+IE) : \\tan \\frac{1}{2}(FI-IE) :: \\tan \\frac{1}{2}(KL-IH)\\).\n\nNow FI + IE, or FE, being the supplement of C, (Theorem 5.), \\(\\tan \\frac{1}{2}FE = \\cot \\frac{1}{2}C\\); and FL, LE being the supplements of FG and GE, FL and LE are the measures of the angles A, B; moreover, IK, IH are the measures of the angles BCD, ACD, therefore, \\(\\cot \\frac{1}{2}C, \\text{ or } \\cot \\frac{1}{2}(P+Q) : \\tan \\frac{1}{2}(A+B) : \\tan \\frac{1}{2}(A-B) : \\tan \\frac{1}{2}(P-Q)\\). In the very same way it may be proved, when the perpendicular falls without the triangle, that \\(\\cot \\frac{1}{2}(P-Q) : \\tan \\frac{1}{2}(A+B) :: \\tan \\frac{1}{2}(A-B) : \\tan \\frac{1}{2}(P+Q)\\).\n\nTheorem XVII.\n\nIn any spherical triangle, the sine of half the sum of the sides is to the sine of half their difference, as the cotangent of half the vertical angle to the tangent of half the difference of the angles at the base.\n\nFor since \\(\\tan a : \\tan b :: \\cot Q : \\cot P\\), therefore,","sp":91,"ep":98},{"h":"ST THOMAS OF CANTERBURY'S DAY","t":"a festival of the Romish church, observed on December 29, in memory of Thomas Becket archbishop of Canterbury, who was murdered, or, as the Romanists say, martyred, in the reign of King Henry II.\n\nTHOMAS the Reynour, called also Thomas Lermont, and Thomas of Erceldon, was born at Erceldon, a village near Melrose in Tweedale, in what year is uncertain; but he was an old man when Edward I. was carrying on war in Scotland.\n\nThe character of Lermont as a prophet, and which was common to him with Linus, Orpheus, and other early poets in many countries, arose, if we may believe Mackenyie in his Lives of Scottich Writers, from his having conferences with Eliza, a nun and prophetess at Haddington. Lermont put her predictions into verse, and thus came in for his share of the prophetic spirit. None of these ancient prophecies now remain; but the following, which pretends to be one of them, is given Account of from a manuscript of the time of Edward I., or II. The Scottich countess of Dunbar is the lady famous for the defence of her castle against the English. Her proper title was Countess of March; but it was common in these times to style a nobleman from his chief residence. Thus Gilbert Strongbow, earl of Pembroke, is called Earl of Strigil, from his residence at Strigil-castle, near Chepflow, Monmouthshire, &c.\n\nLa Countesse de Donbar demande a Thomas de Effedoune, quant la guere d'Effocce prendreit syn.

The reverence of the people for a learned and respectable character seems to have been the sole foundation of Thomas's claim to prophecy. But, in the 16th century, prophecies were made, and ascribed to him, as well as others given to Bede, Merlin, &c. (A). They were printed at Edinburgh, 1615; reprinted 1682, and 1742.\n\nTHOMISM.

Lefley bishop of Rois reports, that the night before the battle between Athelstan king of Northumberland and Hungus king of the Picts, a bright cross, in form of that whereon St Andrew (the tutelar saint of Scotland) suffered martyrdom, appeared to Hungus; who having gained the victory, ever after bore the figure of that cross on his banners.

Others place the foundation of it as low as the year 1500.\n\nThe chief and principal ensign is a gold collar composed of thistles and sprigs of rue interlaced with annulets of gold, having pendent thereto the image of St Andrew with his cross, and the motto, NEMO ME IMPUNE LACESSET. \"No body shall provoke me with impunity.\"\n\nThe ordinary or common ensign worn by the knights is a star of four silver points, and over them a green circle, bordered and lettered with gold, containing the said motto, and in the centre is a thistle; all which is embroidered on their left breast, and worn with the collar, with a green ribbon over the left shoulder, and brought under the right arm; pendent thereto is the image of St Andrew, with his cross, in a purple robe, within an oval of gold enamelled vert, with the former motto; but sometimes they wear, encircled in the same manner, a thistle crowned.\n\nAbout the time of the Reformation, this order was dropped, till James II. of Great Britain resumed it, by creating eight knights.

But his genius inclining him to the study of poetry, which he soon found would be incompatible with that of theology, or at least might prevent his being provided for in that way in his own country, he relinquished his views of engaging in the sacred function, and repaired to London in consequence of some encouragement which he had received from a lady of quality there, a friend of his mother.\n\nThe reception he met with wherever he was introduced, emboldened him to risk the publication of his excellent poem on Winter.\u2014This piece was published in 1726; and from the universal applause it met with, Mr Thomson's acquaintance was courted by people of the first taste and fashion. But the chief advantage which it procured him was the acquaintance of Dr Rundle, afterward bishop of Derry, who introduced him to the late lord chancellor Talbot; and some years after, when the eldest son of that nobleman was to make his tour on the continent, Mr Thomson was chosen as a proper companion for him. The expectations which his Winter had raised, were fully satisfied by the successive publications of the other seasons; of Summer, in the year 1727; of Spring, in the following year; and of Autumn, in a quarto edition of his works, in 1730.\n\nBeside the Seasons, and his tragedy of Sophonisba, written and acted with applause in the year 1729, he had, in 1727, published his poem to the memory of Sir Isaac Newton, with an account of his chief discoveries; in which he was assisted by his friend Mr Gray, a gentleman well versed in the Newtonian philosophy. That same year the resentment of our merchants, for the interruption of their trade by the Spaniards in America, running very high, Mr Thomson zealously took part in it, and wrote his Battainia, to rouse the nation to revenge.\n\nWith the honourable Charles Talbot, our author visited most of the courts in Europe, and returned with his views greatly enlarged; not only of exterior nature and the works of art, but of human life and manners, and of the constitution and policy of the several states, their connections, and their religious institutions. How particular and judicious his observations were, we see in his poem on Liberty, begun soon after his return to England. We see at the same time to what a high pitch his care of his country was raised, by the comparisons he had all along been making of our happy government with those of other nations. To inspire his fellow-subjects with the like sentiments, and show them by what means the precious freedom we enjoy may be preserved, and how it may be abused or lost, he employed two years in composing that noble work, upon which he valued himself more than upon all his other writings.\n\nOn his return to England with Mr Talbot (who soon after died), the chancellor made him his secretary of briefs; a place of little attendance, suiting his retired indolent way of life, and equal to all his wants. From this office he was removed, when death, not long after, deprived him of his noble patron. He then found himself reduced to a state of a precarious dependence. In this situation, having created some few debts, and his creditors finding that he had no longer any certain support, became inexorable; and imagined by confinement to force that from his friends, which his modesty would not permit him to ask. One of these occasions furnished Quin, the celebrated actor, with an opportunity of displaying the natural goodness of his heart, and the disinterestedness of his friendship. Hearing that Thomson was confined in a spunging house for a debt of about 70l. he repaired to the place; and, having inquired for him, was introduced to the bard. Thomson was a good deal disconcerted at seeing Quin, as he had always taken pains to conceal his wants; and the more so, as Quin told him he was come to sup with him. His anxiety upon this head was however removed, upon Quin's informing him, that, as he supposed it would have been inconvenient to have had the supper dressed in the place they were in, he had ordered it from an adjacent tavern; and, as a prelude, half a dozen of claret was introduced. Supper being over, and the bottle circulating pretty briskly, Quin said, \"It is time now we should balance accounts.\" This astonished Thomson, who imagined he had some demand upon him; but Quin perceiving it, continued, \"Mr Thomson, the pleasure I have had in perusing your works I cannot estimate at less than a hundred pounds, and I insist upon now acquitting the debt.\" On saying this, he put down a note of that value, and took his leave, without waiting for a reply.\n\nThe profits arising from his works were not inconsiderable; his tragedy of Agamemnon, acted in 1738, yielded a good sum. But his chief dependence was upon the prince of Wales, who settled on him a handsome allowance, and honoured him with many marks of particular favour. Notwithstanding, this, however, he was\n\n(A) Sibylla and Banister Anglicus are mentioned in the time of Edward IV. (MSS. Cot. Dom. A. IX.) Among Latin prophecy of Bridlington is there given. Waldhave and Eltraine seem also English prophets. In the whole collection, therefore, Thomas is the only Scottish one.\nMr Thomson's poem, entitled the Castle of Indolence, was his last work published by himself; his tragedy of Coriolanus being only prepared for the theatre, when a fatal accident robbed the world of one of the best of men and best of poets. He would commonly walk the distance between London and Richmond (where he lived) with any acquaintance that offered, with whom he might chat and rest himself, or perhaps dine by the way. One summer evening being alone in his walk from town to Hammersmith, he had over-heated himself, and in that condition imprudently took a boat to carry him to Kew; apprehending no bad consequence from the chill air on the river, which his walk to his house, towards the upper end of Kew-lane, had always hitherto prevented. But now the cold had so feasted him, that the next day he was in a high fever. This, however, by the use of proper medicines, was removed, so that he was thought out of danger; till the fine weather having tempted him to expose himself once more to the evening dews, his fever returned with violence, and with such symptoms as left no hopes of a cure. His death happened on the 27th of August 1748.\n\nMr Thomson had improved his taste upon the finest originals, ancient and modern. The autumn was his favourite season for poetical composition, and the deep silence of the night he commonly chose for his studies. The amusement of his leisure hours were civil and natural history, voyages, and the best relations of travellers. Though he performed on no instrument, he was passionately fond of music, and would sometimes listen a full hour at his window to the nightingales in Richmond gardens; nor was his taste less exquisite in the arts of painting, sculpture, and architecture. As for the more distinguishing qualities of his mind and heart, they best appear in his writings. There his devotion to the Supreme Being, his love of mankind, of his country, and friends, shine cut in every page; his tenderness of heart was so unbounded, that it took in even the brute creation. It is not known, that through his whole life he ever gave any person a moment's pain, either by his writings or otherwise. He took no part in the political squabbles of his time, and was therefore respected and left undisturbed by both sides. These amiable virtues did not fail of their due reward; the applause of the public attended all his productions, and his friends loved him with an enthusiastic ardour.\n\n\"As a writer (says Dr Johnson), he is entitled to one praise of the highest kind; his mode of thinking, and of expressing his thoughts, is original. His blank verse is no more the blank verse of Milton, or of any other poet, than the rhymes of Prior are the rhymes of Cowley. His numbers, his pauses, his diction, are of his own growth, without transcription, without imitation. He thinks in a peculiar train, and thinks always as a man of genius; he looks round on Nature and on life with the eye which Nature bestows only on a poet; the eye that distinguishes, in every thing represented to his view, whatever there is on which imagination can delight to be detained, and with a mind that at once comprehends the vast, and attends to the minute. The reader of the Seasons wonders that he never saw before what Thomson fawns him, and that he never yet has felt what Thomson impregnes.\"\n\nHis testamentary executors were the lord Lyttelton, whose care of our poet's fortune and fame ceased not with his life; and Mr Mitchell, a gentleman equally noted for the truth and constancy of his private friendship, and for his address and spirit as a public minister. By their united interests, the orphan play of Coriolanus was brought on the stage to the best advantage; from the profits of which, and the sale of manuscripts and other effects, a handsome sum was remitted to his sisters. His remains were deposited in the church of Richmond, under a plain stone, without any inscription. A handsome monument was erected to him in Westminster abbey in the year 1762, the charge of which was defrayed by the profits arising from a splendid edition of all his works in 1749; Mr Millar the bookseller, who had purchased all Mr Thomson's copies, giving up his property on this grateful occasion. A monument has also been erected to him at the place of his birth.\n\nTHORAX. See Anatomy.\n\nWHITE or LAW THORN.

It was bounded on the north by Mount Haemus; on the south, by the Aegean sea; on the west, by Macedon and the river Strymon; and on the east, by the Euxine sea, the Hellespont, and the Propontis.\u2014The Thracian Chersonesus is a peninsula inclosed on the south by the Aegean sea, on the west by the gulf of Melas, and on the east by the Hellespont; being joined on the north to the continent by a neck of land about 37 furlongs broad. The inland parts of Thrace are very cold and barren, the snow lying on the mountains the greatest part of the year; but the maritime provinces are productive of all sorts of grain and necessaries for life; and withal so pleasant, that Mela compares them to the most fruitful and agreeable countries of Asia.\n\nThe ancient Thracians were deemed a brave and warlike nation, but of a cruel and savage temper; being, according to the Greek writers, strangers to all humanity and good nature. It was to the Thracians, however, that the Greeks were chiefly indebted for the polite arts that flourished among them; for Orpheus, Linus, Musaeus, Thamyris, and Eumolpus, all Thracians, were the first, as Euclathius informs us, who charmed the inhabitants of Greece with their eloquence and melody, and persuaded them to exchange their Thracian fierceness for a sociable life and peaceful manners; nay, great part of Greece was anciently peopled by Thracians. Tereus, a Thracian, governed at Daulis in Phocis, where the tragic story of Philomela and Procne was acted. From thence a body of Thracians passed over to Euboea, and possessed themselves of that island. Of the same nation were the Aones, Tembices, and Hyanthians, who made themselves masters of Boeotia; and great part of Attica itself was inhabited by Thracians, under the command of the celebrated Eumolpus. It is not therefore without the utmost ingratitude and injustice that the Greeks style them Barbarians, since to them chiefly they were indebted both for the peopling and polishing of their country.\n\nThrace was anciently divided into a number of petty states, which were first subdued by Philip of Macedon. On the decline of the Macedonian empire, the country fell under the power of the Romans. It continued under subjection to them till the irruption of the Turks, in whose hands it still remains.","sp":17,"ep":17},{"h":"THRASHING","t":"in Agriculture, the operation by which corn is separated from the straw. This operation is performed in a variety of ways, sometimes by the feet of animals, sometimes by a flail, and sometimes by a machine.\n\nThe most ancient method of separating the corn from the straw was by the hoofs of cattle or horses. This was practised by the Ishmaelites, as we find from the books of Moses; it was also common among the Greeks and Romans*. Flails and thrashing machines were also plentiful, so not uncommon among these nations\u2020. The flail xviii. 30, which was used by the Romans, called baculatus, fulgus, Virgil, iii. or perica, was probably nothing more than a cudgel or club. Pole. The thrashing machine, which was called tribula or tribulum, and sometimes traha, was a kind of sledge made of boards joined together, and loaded with stone or iron. Horses were yoked to this machine, and a man was seated upon it to drive them over the sheaves of corn.\n\nDifferent methods are employed in different countries for separating the corn from the stalk. In the greatest part of France the flail is used; but in the southern districts it is generally performed by the feet of animals. Animals are also used for the same purpose in Spain, in Italy, in the Morea, in the Canaries, in China, and in the vicinity of Canton, where the flail is also sometimes used. It appears that in hot climates the grains do not adhere so firmly to the stalk as in cold countries, and therefore may be more easily separated. This will explain the reason why animals are so frequently employed in hot countries for treading out the corn; whereas in cold climates we know they are seldom tried, and have no reason to suppose that they would answer the purpose. In the Isle of France in Africa, rice and wheat are thrashed with poles, and maize with sticks; for it has not been possible to teach the negroes the use of the flail.\n\nThe animals used for treading out corn are, oxen, cows, horses, mules, and even asses when the quantity is not great. The operation is performed in this manner: The sheaves, after being opened, are spread in such a manner that the ears of the corn are laid as much uppermost as possible, and a man, standing in the centre, holds the halters of the cattle, which are made to trot round as in a manege; whilst other men with forks...\nThrashing-forks shake the straw up from time to time, and the cattle are trotted over it again and again till they have beaten out all the grain. This method is expeditious enough; but besides bruising a considerable quantity of corn, it requires a great many cattle, and injures the legs of the horses and mules, which are preferred before cows and oxen for this work.\n\nThe flail is undoubtedly a much better instrument for thrashing corn than the feet of animals, for it separates the grain from the straw and husks both more effectually and more expeditiously; yet it is liable to many objections. It is a very laborious employment, too severe indeed even for a strong man; and as it is usually the interest of the thrasher rather to thrash much than to thrash clean, a good deal of corn will generally be left upon the straw. It is therefore an object of great importance in husbandry to procure a proper machine for separating the corn from the straw.\n\nThe first thrashing machine attempted in modern times, of which we have received any account, was invented in Edinburgh by Mr Michael Menzies about the year 1732. It consisted of a number of instruments like flails, fixed in a moveable beam, and inclined to it at an angle of ten degrees. On each side of the beam in which the flails were fixed, floors or benches were placed for spreading the sheaves on. The flails were moved backwards and forwards upon the benches by means of a crank fixed on the end of an axle, which made about 30 revolutions in a minute.\n\nThe second thrashing machine was invented by Mr Michael Stirling, a farmer in the parish of Dunblane, Perthshire. Of this discovery we have received a very accurate and authentic account from his son, the reverend Mr Robert Stirling minister of Crieff.\n\nIt is an old proverb, that necessity is the mother of invention. This was verified on the present occasion. Besides his ordinary domestic servants, Mr M. Stirling had occasion sometimes to hire an additional number to thrash out his grain, and frequently found it difficult to procure so many as he needed. This naturally led him to reflect whether the operation of thrashing could not easily be performed by machinery. Accordingly, so early as the year 1753, under the pretence of joining in the amusements of his children, he formed in miniature a water mill, in which two iron springs, made to rise and fall alternately, represented the motion of two flails, by which a few stalks of corn put under them might be speedily thrashed. This plan he executed on a scale sufficiently large within two years after, making the springs about ten feet long, each of which had one end firmly screwed into a solid plank, and the other terminated in a round baton of solid iron, two feet long and above an inch in diameter. Under these the sheaves were conveyed gradually forward in a narrow channel or trough, by passing between two indented horizontal cylinders, similar to those now used in the most of the thrashing mills in that part of the country, and called feeders. In this manner the thrashing was executed completely, and with considerable rapidity; but as the operation was performed on a low floor, and no method contrived for carrying off the straw, the accumulation of it produced such confusion, and the removal of it was attended with such danger, that this scheme was very soon entirely abandoned. The mortification arising from disappointment, and especially the scoffs of his neighbours, for what was universally accounted an absurd and ridiculous attempt, served only to stimulate the exertions of the inventor to accomplish his designs on another plan.\n\nLaying aside therefore the iron springs with the feeders, and all the apparatus adapted to them, he retained only an outer or water wheel, with an inner or cog wheel moving on the same axle: to this inner wheel, which had 48 teeth or cogs, he applied a vertical trundle or pinion, with seven notches, the axle of which passed through a floor above the wheel, and having its upper pivot secured in a beam fix feet above that floor. At the distance of three feet three inches above the floor two straight pieces of squared wood, each four feet long, passed through the axle of the trundle at right angles, forming four arms, to be moved round horizontally. To the extremities of these arms were fixed four iron plates, each 20 inches long, and eight broad at the end next the arms, but tapering towards a point at the other end. This large horizontal fly, constituting four thrashers, was inclosed within a wooden cylindrical box three feet and a half high and eight in diameter. On the top of the box was an opening or port (two or three ports were made at first, but one was found sufficient) eight inches wide, and extending from the circumference a foot and a half towards its centre, through which the corn sheaves descended, being first opened and laid one by one on a board with two ledges gently declining towards the port; on which board they were moderately pressed down with a boy's hand, to prevent them from being too hastily drawn in by the repeated strokes of the thrashers. Within the box was an inclined plane, along which the straw and grain fell down into a wide wire riddle two feet square, placed immediately under a hole of nearly the same size. The riddle received a jerk at every revolution of the spindle from a knob placed on the side of it, and was instantly thrust backward by a small spring pressing it in the opposite direction. The short straw, with the grain and chaff which passed through the wide riddle, fell immediately into an oblong strait riddle, which hung with one end raised and the other depressed, and was moved by a contrivance equally simple as the other; and having no ledge at the lower end, the long chaff which could not pass through the riddle dropped from thence to the ground; while the grain and most of the chaff falling through the riddle into a pair of common barn-fanners that stood under it on the ground floor, the strong grain, the weak, and the chaff, were all separated with great exactness. The fanners were moved by a rope or band running circuitously in a shallow niche cut on the circumference of the cog-wheel. The straw collected gradually in the bottom of the box over the wide riddle, and through an opening, two and a half feet wide, and as much in height, left in that side of the box nearest the brink of the upper floor, was drawn down to the ground with a rake by the person or persons employed to form it into sheaves or rolls.\n\nSuch was the thrashing mill invented by Mr Michael Stirling, which, after various alterations and improvements he completed in the form now described, A.D. 1758. By experiment it was found that four bolls of oats, Linlithgow measure, could be thrashed by it in 25 minutes. From that period he never used a common flail in thrashing, except for humbling or bearding barley.\nThrashing. In every other kind of grain he performed the whole operation of thrashing with the mill; and continued always to use it till 1772, when he retired from business, and his thrashing mill became the property of his second son, who continues to use it with equal advantage and satisfaction. Several machines were constructed on the same plan, particularly one near Stirling, under Mr Stirling's direction, for Mr Moir of Leckie, in 1765, which, we understand, has been used ever since, and gives complete satisfaction to the proprietor. There was another erected in 1778 by Mr Thomas Keir (in the parish of Muthil and county of Perth), who has contrived a method of beating barley with it: and by the addition of a small spindle with short arms contiguous to the front of the box, and moved by a band common to it and the great spindle to which it is parallel, the straw is shaken and whirled out of the box to the ground. That this machine did not come immediately into general use, was owing partly to the smallness of the farms in that part of the country, whose crops could easily be thrashed by the few hands necessarily retained on them for other purposes; and chiefly to an apprehension that the machine could only be moved by water; an apprehension which experience proves to be entirely groundless. The machine however, was ingenious, and did great credit to the worthy inventor, and certainly deserved a better fate than it was destined to undergo.\n\nA third thrashing mill was invented in 1772, by two persons nearly about the same time, and upon the same principles. The inventors were, Mr Alderton who lived near Alnwick, and Mr Smart at Wark in Northumberland. The operation was performed by rubbing. The sheaves were carried round between an indented drum of about six feet diameter, and a number of indented rollers arranged round the circumference of the drum, and attached to it by means of springs; so that while the drum revolved, the fluted rollers rubbed the corn off from the straw by rubbing against the flutings of the drum. But as a considerable quantity of the grain was bruised in passing between the rollers, the machine was soon laid aside.\n\nIn 1776 an attempt was made by Mr Andrew Meikle, an ingenious millwright in the parish of Tyningham, East Lothian, to construct a new machine upon the principles which had been adopted by Mr Menzies already mentioned. This consisted in making joints in the flails, which Mr Menzies had formed without any. But this machine, after much labour and expense, was soon laid aside, on account of the difficulty of keeping it in repair, and the small quantity of work performed, which did not exceed one boll or six Winchester bushels of barley per hour.\n\nSome time after this, Mr Francis Kinloch, then junior of Gilmerton, having visited the machine invented in Northumberland, attempted an improvement upon it. He inclosed the drum in a fluted cover; and instead of making the drum itself fluted, he fixed upon the outside of it four fluted pieces of wood, which by means of springs could be raised a little above the circumference of the drum, so as to press against the fluted covering, and thus rub off the ears of corn as the sheaves passed round between the drum and the fluted covering. But not finding this machine to answer his expectation (for it bruised the grain in the same manner as the Northumberland machine did), he sent it to Mr Meikle, that he might, if possible, rectify its errors.\n\nMr Meikle, who had long directed his thoughts to this subject, applied himself with much ardour and perseverance to the improvement and correction of this machine; and after spending a good deal of time upon it, found it was constructed upon principles so erroneous, that to improve it was impracticable.\n\nAt length, however, Mr Meikle's own genius invented a model, different in principle from the machines which had already been constructed. This model was made in the year 1785; and in the following year the first thrashing machine on the same principles was erected in the neighbourhood of Alloa, in the county of Stirling, by Mr George Meikle the son of the inventor. This machine answered completely the wishes of Mr Stein, the gentleman for whom it was erected, who gave the most ample testimony of his satisfaction both to the inventor and to the public. The fame of this discovery soon spread over the whole country, and a great many farmers immediately applied to Mr Meikle, desiring to have thrashing mills erected on their farms. The discovery, it appeared, would be profitable, and it was reasonable that the inventor should enjoy the profits of his invention. He accordingly applied for a patent; which, after considerable expense, arising from the opposition of some persons, who claimed a share in the discovery, was granted.\u2014These machines are now becoming very common in many parts of Scotland, and are increasing very considerably in number every year over all the united kingdom.\n\nWe will now endeavour to describe this machine in its most improved state; which is so simple that with the affluence of a plate, exhibiting the plan of elevation, fig. 1, the ground plan, fig. 2, and the 3d showing its essential parts in a distinct manner, we hope it will be easily understood by all our readers who have not had an opportunity of seeing it. The power employed for turning that part of the machine which separates the corn from the straw is produced by four wheels (when moved by horses), the teeth of which move in one another and turn the drum, on which four scutchers are fixed. The sheaves are introduced between two fluted rollers, which hold them firm, and draw them in gradually, while the scutchers strike off the grain from the straw as it passes through. This will suffice for a general idea of this machine. We will now be more particular.\n\nThe large spur-wheel A, fig. 1, and 2, which has Fig. 1. and 276 cogs, is horizontal, and moves the pinion B, which has 14 teeth. The pinion B moves the crown-wheel C, which has 84 teeth; the wheel C moves a second pinion D, which has 16 teeth; and the pinion D moves the drum HIKL. The drum is a hollow cylinder three feet and a half diameter, and placed horizontally; on the outside of which the scutchers are fixed by strong screw bolts. The scutchers consist of four pieces of wood, faced on one side with a thin plate of iron, placed at an equal distance from each other, and at right angles to the axis of the drum.\n\nThe sheaves are spread on an inclined board F, fig. 3, from which they are introduced between two fluted rollers GG made of cast iron, about three inches and a half in diameter, and making about 35 revolutions in a minute. As these rollers are only about three quarters of\nThrashing of an inch distant from the scutchers or leaves of the drum HIKL, they serve to hold the sheaves fast, while the scutchers \\(a, b, c, d\\) moving with prodigious velocity, separate the grain completely from the straw, and at the same time throw out both grain and straw upon the concave rack M, lying horizontally with slender parallel ribs, so that the corn passes through them into a hopper N placed below. From the hopper it passes through a harp or riddle O into a pair of fans P, from which, in the most improved machines, it comes out clean and fit for the market. The straw, after being thrown by the scutchers \\(a, b, c, d\\) into the rack, is removed from it by a rake QRS into a place contiguous V. The rake consists of four thin pieces of wood or leaves; on the end of each of these leaves is ranged a row of teeth e, f, g, h, five inches long. The rake moves in a circular manner in the concave rack, while the teeth catch hold of the straw, and throw it out of the rack. These are all the essential parts of the machine; the rest may be easily understood by the references to the Plate. W is the horse-course, No. 1, which is 27 feet diameter. X is the pillar for supporting the beams on which the axle of the spur-wheel is fixed. YYY are three spindles for moving the two fluted rollers, the rake, and fans. To the description now given we have only to add, that the drum has a covering of wood Z at a small distance above it, for the purpose of keeping the sheaves close to the scutchers.\n\nThe advantages of this machine are many. As the drum makes 300 revolutions in a minute, the four scutchers together make 200 strokes in the same space of time. From such power and velocity, it is evident that much work must be performed. When the horses go at the rate of two and one-third miles per hour, from three to six bolls will be thrashed; but as the quantity thrashed will be less when the straw is long than when it is short, we shall take the average at four bolls. One gentleman, whose veracity and accuracy we can depend on, assures us, that his mill thrashed 63 bolls in a day; by which, we suppose, he meant 10 hours. To prove the superior advantage of this machine to the common method of thrashing with flails, a gentleman ordered two equal quantities of oats to be thrashed by the mill and by flails. When the corn was cleaned and measured, he obtained one-sixteenth more from the sheaves thrashed by the mill than from those thrashed by the flail. We are also informed by another gentleman who has studied this machine with much attention, and calculated its advantages with care, that, independently of having the corn much cleaner separated from the straw than is usually done by flails, there is a saving of 30 or 40 per cent. in the expense of thrashing.\n\nThe number of persons requisite for attending the mill when working is six: One person drives the horses; a second hands the sheaves to a third, who unties them, while a fourth spreads them on the inclined boards and presses them gently between the rollers; a fifth person is necessary to riddle the corn as it falls from the fans, Thrashing and a sixth to remove the straw (A).\n\nThis machine can be moved equally well by water, wind, or horses. Mr Meikle has made such improvements on the wind-mill as to render it much more manageable and convenient than formerly; and we are informed many wind-mills are now erecting in different parts of the country. As to the comparative expense of these different machines, the erection of the horse machine is least; but then the expense of employing horses must be taken into consideration. One of this kind may be erected for 70l. A water mill will cost 10l. more on account of the expense of the water-wheel. A wind-mill will cost from 200l. to 300l. sterling.","sp":17,"ep":22},{"h":"THRASYBULUS","t":"a renowned Athenian general and patriot, the deliverer of his country from the yoke of the 30 tyrants, lived about 294 B.C.","sp":22,"ep":22},{"h":"THRASYMENUS TACUS","t":"in *Ancient Geography*, No. 3, a lake of Etruria, near Perugia, and not far from the Tiber, fatal to the Romans in the Punic war.

He also left memoirs of his own life, besides poems; and died at Paris, 1617.","sp":23,"ep":23},{"h":"THUCYDIDES","t":"a celebrated Greek historian, was born at Athens 471 B.C. He was the son of Olorus, and grandson of Militiades, who is thought to have been descended from Militiades the famous Athenian general, and to have married the king of Thrace's daughter. He was educated in a manner suitable to his quality, that is, in the study of philosophy and eloquence. His master in the former was Anaxagoras, in the latter Antipho; one, by his description in the eighth book of his History, for power of speech almost a miracle, and feared by the people on that account. Suidas and Pho-tius relate, that when Herodotus recited his history in public, a fashion in use then and many ages after, Thucydides felt so great a sting of emulation, that it drew tears from him; inasmuch that Herodotus himself took notice of it, and congratulated his father on having a son who showed so wonderful an affection to the Muses. Herodotus was then 29 years of age, Thucydides about 16.\n\nWhen the Peloponnesian war began to break out, Thucydides conjectured truly, that it would prove a subject worthy of his labour; and it no sooner commenced than he began to keep a journal. This explains the reason why he has attended more to chronological order than to unity of design. During the same war he was commissioned by his countrymen to relieve Amphipolis; but the quick march of Brasidas the Lacedaemonian general defeated his operations; and Thucydides, unsuccessful in his expedition, was banished from Athens. This happened in the eighth year of this celebrated war; and in the place of his banishment the general began to write an impartial history of the important events which had happened during his administration, and which still continued to agitate the several states of Greece. This famous history is continued only to the 21st year of the war, and the remaining part of the time till the demolition of the walls of Athens was described by the pen of Theopompus and Xenophon. Thucydides wrote in the Attic dialect, as being possessed of most vigour, purity, elegance, and energy. He spared neither time nor money to procure authentic materials; and the Athenians, as well as their enemies, furnished him with many valuable communications, which contributed to throw great light on the different transactions of the war. His history has been divided into eight books; the last of which is imperfect, and supposed to have been written by his daughter.\n\nThe historian of Halicarnassus has often been compared with the son of Olorus, but each has his peculiar excellence. Sweetness of style, grace and elegance of expression, may be called the characteristics of the former; while Thucydides stands unequalled for the fire of his descriptions, the conciseness, and at the same time the strong and energetic manner of his narratives. His relations are authentic, as he himself was interested in the events he mentions; his impartiality is indubitable, as he nowhere betrays the least resentment against his countrymen, and the factious partizans of Cleon, who had banished him from Athens. The history of Thucydides was so admired by Demosthenes, that he transcribed it eight different times, and read it with such attention, that he could almost repeat it by heart. Thucydides died at Athens, where he had been recalled from his exile about 411 years B.C.\n\nThe best edition of Thucydides is that of Oxford, published in 1696, folio, and that of Duker, published at Amsterdam in 1731, folio.","sp":23,"ep":23},{"h":"THUIA","t":"the Arbor Vit\u00e6; a genus of plants belonging to the clas of monadelphia, and order of monoc\u00e6; and in the natural system ranging under the 31st order, Coniferae.

It is bounded on the north by the country of the Mongols and the desert of Kobi; on the east by China; on the west by Hindoostan, and on the south by the same country and the kingdom of Ava. In the valleys lying between the lower mountains are many tribes of Indian people; and a dispute happening between the heirs of one of the rajahs or petty princes, one party called to their assistance the Boutaners, and the other the British. The latter prevailed; and the fame of British valour being carried to the court of Tibet, the Teeshoo Lama, who ruled the state under the Delai-Lama, at that time in his minority, sent a deputation to Bengal, desiring peace for the prince who had been engaged in war with the British. This was readily granted by the governor; and Mr Bogle was sent ambassador to the court of Tibet, where he resided several months; and after an absence of a year and a quarter, returned to Calcutta. The account of this gentleman's expedition hath not been published by himself; but from Mr Stewart's letter to Sir John Pringle, published in the Philosophical Transactions, vol. lxvii. we learn the following particulars, collected from his papers.\n\n\"Mr Bogle divides the territories of the Delai-Lama into two different parts. That which lies immediately contiguous to Bengal, and which is called by the inhabitants Doopo, he distinguishes by the name of Bootan; and the other, which extends to the northward as far as the frontiers of Tartary, called by the natives Pu, he styles Tibet. Bootan is ruled by the Dah Terriah, or Deb Rajah. It is a country of steep and inaccessible mountains, whose summits are crowned with eternal snow; they are intersected with deep valleys, through which pour numberless torrents that increase in their course, and at last, gaining the plains, lose themselves in the great rivers of Bengal. These mountains are covered down their sides with forests of stately trees of various sorts; some (such as pines, &c.) which are known in Europe; others, such as are peculiar to the country and climate. The valleys and sides of the hills which admit of cultivation are not unfruitful, but produce crops of wheat, barley, and rice. The inhabitants are a stout and warlike people, of a copper complexion, in size rather above the middle European stature, hasty and quarrelsome in their temper, and addicted to the use of spirituous liquors; but honest in their dealings, robbery by violence being almost unknown among them. The chief city is Talley Seddein, situated on the Patchoo. Tibet begins properly from the top of the great ridge of the Caucasus, and extends from thence in breadth to the confines of Great Tartary, and perhaps to some of the dominions of the Russian empire. The woods, which everywhere cover the mountains in Bootan, are here totally unknown; and, except a few straggling trees near the villages, nothing of the sort is to be seen. The climate is extremely severe and rude. At Chamnaning, where he wintered, although it be in latitude 31\u00b0 39', only 80\u00b0 to the northward of Calcutta, he often found the thermometer in his room at 29\u00b0 by Fahrenheit's scale; and in the middle of April the standing waters were all frozen, and heavy showers of snow perpetually fell. This, no doubt, must be owing to the great elevation of the country, and to the vast...\"\nThe Tibetans are of a smaller size than their southern neighbours, and of a less robust make. Their complexions are also fairer, and many of them have even a ruddiness in their countenances unknown to the other climates of the east. Those whom Mr Bogle saw at Calcutta appeared to have quite the Tartar face. They are of a mild and cheerful temper; the higher ranks are polite and entertaining in conversation, in which they never mix either strained compliments or flattery. The common people, both in Bootan and Tibet, are clothed in coarse woollen stuffs of their own manufacture, lined with such skins as they can procure: but the better orders of men are dressed in European cloth, or China silk, lined with the finest Siberian furs. The use of linen is totally unknown among them. The chief food of the inhabitants is the milk of their cattle, prepared into cheese, butter, or mixed with the flour of a coarse barley or of peas, the only grain which their soil produces; but they are furnished with rice and wheat from Bengal and other countries in their neighbourhood. They also are supplied with fish from the rivers in their own and the neighbouring provinces, salted and sent into the interior parts. They have no want of animal food from the cattle, sheep, and hogs, which are raised on their hills; and are not destitute of game. They have a singular method of preparing their mutton, by exposing the carcass entire, after the bowels are taken out, to the sun and bleak northern winds which blow in the months of August and September, without frost, so dry up the juices and parch the skin, that the meat will keep uncorrupted for the year round. This they generally eat raw, without any other preparation.\n\nThe religion and political constitution of this country, which are intimately blended together, would make a considerable chapter in its history. It suffices to say, that at present, and ever since the expulsion of the Eluth Tartars, the kingdom of Tibet is regarded as depending on the empire of China, which they call Cathay; and there actually reside two mandarins, with a garrison of a thousand Chinese, at Lahafia the capital, to support the government; but their power does not extend far: and in fact the Lama, whose empire is founded on the surest grounds, personal affection and religious reverence, governs every thing internally with unbounded authority. Every body knows that the Delai Lama is the great object of adoration for the various tribes of heathen Tartars, who roam through the vast tract of continent which stretches from the banks of the Volga to Correa on the sea of Japan, the most extensive religious dominion, perhaps, on the face of the globe. See LAMA.\n\nIt is an old notion, that the religion of Tibet is a corrupted Christianity: and even Father Diderot, a Jesuit (but not of the Chinese mission) who visited the country about the beginning of this century, thinks he can resolve all their mysteries into ours; and affirms, with a truly mystical penetration, that they have certainly a good notion of the Trinity, since in their ad-\n\ndresses to the Deity, they say as often konciok-gik in the plural as konciok in the singular, and with their rofaries pronounce these words om, ha, hum. The truth is, that the religion of Tibet, from whatever source it sprung, is pure and simple in its source, conveying very exalted notions of the Deity, with no contemptible system of morality: but in its progress it has been greatly altered and corrupted by the inventions of worldly men; a fate we can hardly regret in a system of error, since we know that that of truth has been subject to the same. Polygamy, at least in the sense we commonly receive the word, is not in practice among them; but it exists in a manner still more repugnant to European ideas; for there is a plurality of husbands, which is firmly established and highly respected there. In a country where the means of subsisting a family are not easily found, it seems not impolitic to allow a set of brothers to agree in raising one, which is to be maintained by their joint efforts. In short, it is usual in Tibet for the brothers in the family to have a wife in common, and they generally live in great harmony and comfort with her; but not sometimes little dissensions will arise (as may happen in families constituted upon different principles), an instance of which Mr Bogle mentions in the case of a modest and virtuous lady, the wife of half a dozen of the Teehoo Lama's nephews, who complained to the uncle that the two youngest of her husbands did not furnish that share of love and benevolence to the common stock which duty and religion required of them. In short, however strange this custom may appear to us, it is an undoubted fact that it prevails in Tibet.\n\nThe dead are exposed on the pinnacle of some neighbouring mountain, to be devoured by wild beasts and birds of prey, or waited away by time and the vicissitudes of the weather in which they lie. The mangled carcases and bleached bones lie scattered about; and amidst this scene of horror, some miserable old wretch, man or woman, loit to all feelings but those of superstition, generally sets up an abode, to perform the dismal office of receiving the bodies, affixing each a place, and gathering up the remains when too widely dispersed.\n\nTo the account of Tibet which we have given from the communications of Mr Bogle, we may add the information which we have obtained from a later traveller, Mr Saunders* surgeon at Boglepoor in Bengal, who made a journey into Tibet in the year 1783. His observations chiefly respect the natural productions and districts of the country.\n\nThe plants which Mr Saunders found were almost all European plants, a great number of them being natives of Britain. From the appearance of the hills he concludes that they must contain many ores of metal and pyrites. There are inexhaustible quantities of tincal or borax, and rock-salt is plentiful; gold-dust is found in great quantities in the beds of rivers, and sometimes in large masses, lumps, and irregular veins; lead, cinabar containing a large proportion of quicksilver, copper, and iron, he thinks, might easily be procured. But the inhabitants of Tibet have no better fuel than the dung of animals. A coal mine would be a valuable discovery. We are told, that in some parts of China bordering on Tibet coal is found and used as fuel.\n\nIt is remarkable that the same disease prevails at the foot.\nfoot of the mountains of Tibet as in Switzerland at the foot of the Alps, a glandular swelling in the throat commonly called goitre.\n\nThe language spoken in Tibet is different from that of the Tartars. The astronomers are acquainted with the motion of the heavenly bodies, and able to calculate eclipses; but the lamas are generally ignorant; few of them can read, much less understand their ancient books.","sp":24,"ep":26},{"h":"TIBULLUS","t":"AULUS ALBIUS, a Roman knight, and a celebrated Latin poet, was born at Rome 43 B.C.

It is observed, that on the shores of the ocean, and in bays, creeks, and harbours, which communicate freely with the ocean, the waters rise up above this mean height twice a day, and as often sink below it, forming what is called a FLOOD and an EBB, a HIGH and LOW WATER. The whole interval between high and low water is called a TIDE; the water is said to FLOW and to EBB; and the rising is called the FLOOD-TIDE, and the falling is called the EBB TIDE.\n\n2nd. It is observed, that this rise and fall of the waters is variable in quantity. At Plymouth, for instance, it is sometimes 21 feet between the greatest and least depth of the water in one day, and sometimes only 12 feet.\n\nThese different heights of tide are observed to succeed each other in a regular series, diminishing from the greatest to the least, and then increasing from the least to the greatest. The greatest is called a SPRING TIDE, and the least is called a NEAP TIDE.\n\n3rd. This series is completed in about 15 days. More careful observation shows that two series are completed in the exact time of a lunation. For the spring tide in any place is observed to happen precisely at a certain interval of time (generally between two and three days) after new or full moon; and the neap tide at a certain interval after half moon: or, more accurately speaking, it is observed that the spring tide always happens when the moon has got a certain number of degrees eastward of the line of conjunction and opposition, and the neap tide happens when she is a certain number of degrees from her first or last quadrature. Thus the whole series of tides appears to be regulated by the moon.\n\n4th. It is observed that high water happens at new and full moon, when the moon has a certain determined position with respect to the meridian of the place of observation, preceding or following the moon's southing.\nTide. fouthing a certain interval of time; which is constant with respect to that place, but very different in different places.\n\n5th. The time of high water in any place appears to be regulated by the moon; for the interval between the time of high water and the moon's fouthing never changes above three quarters of an hour, whereas the interval between the time of high water and noon changes six hours in the course of a fortnight.\n\n6th. The interval between two succeeding high waters is variable. It is least of all about new and full moon, and greatest when the moon is in her quadratures. As two high waters happen every day, we may call the double of their interval a tide day, as we call the diurnal revolution of the moon a lunar day. The tide is shortest about new and full moon, being then about 24\u00b0 37' ; about the time of the moon's quadratures it is 25\u00b0 27'. These values are taken from a mean of many observations made at Barbadoes by Dr Mafkelyne.\n\n7th. The tides in similar circumstances are greatest when the moon is at her smallest distance from the earth, or in her perigee, and, gradually diminishing, are smallest when she is in her apogee.\n\n8th. The same remark is made with respect to the sun's distance, and the greatest tides are observed during the winter months of Europe.\n\n9th. The tides in any part of the ocean increase as the moon, by changing her declination, approaches the zenith of that place.\n\n10th. The tides which happen while the moon is above the horizon are greater than the tides of the same day when the moon is below the horizon.\n\nSuch are the regular phenomena of the tides. They are important to all commercial nations, and have therefore been much attended to. It is of the tides, in all probability, that the Bible speaks, when God is said to set bounds to the sea, and to say, \"thus far shall it go, and no farther.\"\n\nHomer is the earliest profane author who speaks of the tides. Indeed it is not very clear that it is of them that he speaks (in the 12th book of the Odyssey) when he speaks of Charybdis, which rises and retires thrice in every day. Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus speak more distinctly of the tides in the Red sea. Pytheas of Marseille is the first who says anything of their cause. According to Strabo he had been in Britain, where he must have observed the tides of the ocean. Plutarch says expressly that Pytheas ascribed them to the moon. It is somewhat wonderful that Aristotle says so little about the tides. The army of Alexander, his pupil, were startled at their first appearance to them near the Persian gulf; and we should have thought that Aristotle would be well informed of all that had been observed there. But there are only three passages concerning them in all Aristotle's writings, and they are very trivial. In one place he speaks of great tides observed in the north of Europe; in another, he mentions their having been ascribed by some to the moon; and in a third, he says, that the tide in a great sea exceeds that in a small one.\n\nThe Greeks had little opportunity of observing the tides. The conquests and the commerce of the Romans gave them more acquaintance with them. Caesar speaks of them in the 4th book of his Gallic War. Strabo, after Poseidonius, classes the phenomena into daily, monthly, and annual. He observes, that the sea rises as the moon gets near the meridian, whether above or below the horizon, and falls again as the rises or falls; also, that the tides increase at the time of new and full moon, and are greatest at the summer solstice. Pliny explains the phenomena at some length; and says, that both the sun and moon are their cause, dragging the waters along with them (B. II. c. 97). Seneca (Nat. Qu\u00e6st. III. 28.) speaks of the tide with correctness; and Macrobius (Sonn. Scip. I. 6.) gives a very accurate description of their motions.\n\nIt is impossible that such phenomena should not excite human curiosity as to their cause. Plutarch (Plaut. Phil. III. 17.), Galileo (Synt. Mund. Dial. 4.), Riccioli in his Almagest, ii. p. 374., and Gaffendi, i. p. 27., have collected most of the notions of their predecessors on the subject; but they are of so little importance, that they do not deserve our notice. Kepler speaks more like a philosopher (De Stella Maris, and Epit. Astron. p. 355.). He says that all bodies attract each other, and that the waters of the ocean would all go to the moon were they not retained by the attraction of the earth; and then goes on to explain their elevation under the moon and on the opposite side, because the earth is less attracted by the moon than the nearer waters, but more than the waters which are more remote.\n\nThe honour of a complete explanation of the tides was reserved for Sir Isaac Newton. He laid hold of this class of phenomena as the most incontestable proof of universal gravitation, and has given a most beautiful and synoptical view of the whole subject; contenting himself, however, with merely exhibiting the chief consequences of the general principle, and applying it to the phenomena with singular address. But the wide steps taken by this great philosopher in his investigation leave ordinary readers frequently at fault: many of his assumptions require the greatest mathematical knowledge to satisfy us of their truth. The academy of Paris therefore proposed to illustrate this among other parts of the principles of natural philosophy, and published the theory of the tides as a prize problem. This produced three excellent dissertations by M. Laurin, Dan. Bernoulli, and Euler. Aided by these, and chiefly by the second, we shall here give a physical theory, and accommodate it to the purposes of navigation by giving the rules of calculation. We have demonstrated in our dissertations on the physical principles of the celestial motions, that it is an unexpected fact, that every particle of matter in the solar system is actually deflected toward every other particle; and that the deflection of a particle of matter toward any distant sphere is proportional to the quantity of matter in that sphere directly, and to the square of the distance of the particle from the centre of that sphere inversely: and having found that the heaviness of a piece of terrestrial matter is nothing but the supposed opponent to the force which we exert in carrying this piece of matter, we conceive it as possessing a property, that is, distinguishing quality, manifested by its being gravity or heavy. This is heaviness, gravitas, gravity; and the manifestation of this quality, or the event in which it is seen, whether it be directly falling, or deflecting in a parabolic curve, or stretching a coiled spring, or breaking a rope, or simply prelging on its support, is gravitatio, gravitation; and the body is said to gravitate. When all obstacles are removed from the body,\nbody, as when we cut the string by which a stone is hung, it moves directly downwards, tendit ad terram. Si discedatur funis tenderet lapis ad terram. Dum vero funis integer perfest, lapis terram versus nisi cenfatur. By some metaphysical processes, which it is needless at present to trace, this nus ad motum has been called a tendency in our language. Indeed the word has now come to signify the energy of any active quality in those cases where its simplest and most immediate manifestation is prevented by some obstacle. The stone is now said to tend towards the earth, though it does not actually approach it, being withheld by the string. The stretching of the string in a direction perpendicular to the horizon is conceived as a full manifestation of this tendency. This tendency, this energy of its heaviness, is therefore named by the word which distinguishes the quality; and it is called gravitation, and it is said to gravitate.\n\nBut Sir Isaac Newton discovered that this deflection of a heavy body differs in no respect from that general deflection observed in all the bodies of the solar system. For 16 feet, which is the deflection of a stone in one second, has the very same proportion to \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) th of an inch, which is the simultaneous deflection of the moon, that the square of the moon's distance from the centre of the earth has to the square of the stone's distance from it, namely, that of 3600 to 1.\n\nThus we are enabled to compare all the effects of the mutual tendencies of the heavenly bodies with the tendency of gravity, whose effects and measures are familiar to us.\n\nIf the earth were a sphere covered to a great depth with water, the water would form a concentric spherical shell; for the gravitation of every particle of its surface would then be directed to the centre, and would be equal. The curvature of its surface therefore would be everywhere the same, that is, it would be the uniform curvature of a sphere.\n\nIt has been demonstrated in former articles, after Sir Isaac Newton, that the gravitation of a particle C (fig. 1.) to the centre O, is to that of a particle E at the surface as CO to EO. In like manner the gravitation of o is to that of p as o to p O. If therefore EO and OP are two communicating canals, of equal lengths, the water in both would be in equilibrium, because each column would exert the same total pressure at O. But if the gravitation of each particle in PO be diminished by a certain proportion, such as \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) th of its whole weight, it is plain that the total pressure of the column PO will be \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) th part less than that of the column EO. Therefore they will no longer be in equilibrium. The weight of the column EO will prevail; and if a hollow tower PP be built at the mouth of the pit PO, the water will sink in EO and rise in OP, till both are again in equilibrium, exerting equal total pressures at O. Or we may prevent the sinking at E by pouring in more water into the tower PP. The same thing must happen in the canal FC perpendicular to EO, if the gravitation of every particle be diminished by a force acting in the direction CF, and proportional to the distance of the particle from C, and such, that when eC is equal to oO, the force acting on e is equal to the force acting on o. In order that the former equilibrium may be restored after this diminution of the gravitation of the column FC, it is plain that more water must be poured into the oblique tower FF. All this is evident when we consider the matter hydrostatically. The gravitation of the particle e may be represented by oO; but the diminution of the pressure occasioned by this at O is represented by Cc.\n\nHence we can collect this much, that the whole diminution of pressure at C is to the whole diminution of pressure at O as the sum of all the lines CC to the sum of all the lines OO, that is, as \\( fC^2 \\) to \\( PO^2 \\). But the weight of the small quantity of water added in each tower is diminished in the same proportion; therefore the quantity added at FF must be to the quantity added at PP as \\( fC \\) to \\( PO \\). Therefore we must have \\( Ff : PP = fC : PO \\), and the points E, F, P, must be in the circumference of an ellipse, of which PO and EO are the transverse and conjugate semi-axes.\n\nWhat we have here supposed concerning the diminution of gravity in these canals is a thing which really obtains in nature. It was demonstrated, when treating of the Precession of the Equinoxes, that if the sun or moon lie in the direction OP, at a very great distance, there results from the unequal gravitation of the different particles of the earth a diminution of the gravity of each particle; which diminution is in a direction parallel to OP, and proportional to the distance of the particle from a plane passing through the centre of the earth at right angles to the line OP.\n\nThus it happens that the waters of the ocean have their equilibrium disturbed by the unequal gravitation of their different particles to the sun or to the moon; and this equilibrium cannot be restored till the waters come in from all hands, and rise up around the line joining the centres of the earth and of the luminaries. The spherical ocean must acquire the form of a prolate spheroid generated by the revolution of an ellipse round its transverse axis. The waters will be highest in that place which has the luminary in its zenith, and in the antipodes to that place; and they will be most depressed in all those places which have the luminary in their horizon. P and P' will be the poles, and EOQ will be the equator of this prolate spheroid.\n\nMr Ferguson, in his Astronomy, affirms another cause of this arrangement, viz., the difference of the centrifugal forces of the different particles of water, while the earth is turning round the common centre of gravity of the earth and moon. This, however, is a mistake. It would be just if the earth and moon were attached to the ends of a rod, and the earth kept always the same face toward the moon.\n\nIt is evident that the accumulation at P and P', and the depression at the equator, must augment and diminish in the same proportion with the disturbing force. It is also evident that its absolute quantity may be discovered by our knowledge of the proportion of the disturbing force to the force of gravity.\u2014Now this proportion is known; for the proportion of the gravitation of the earth's centre to the sun or moon, to the force of gravity at the earth's surface, is known; and the proportion of the gravitation of the earth's centre to the luminaries, to the difference of the gravitations of the centre and of the surface, is also known, being very nearly the proportion of the distance of the luminaries to twice the radius of the earth.\n\nAlthough this reasoning, by which we have ascertained the elliptical form of the watery spheroid, be sufficiently\nciently convincing, it is very imperfect, being accommodated to one condition only of equilibrium, viz. the equilibrium of the canals \\( f \\) and \\( c \\). There are several other conditions equally necessary to which this lax reasoning will not apply, such as the direction of the whole remaining gravitation in any point \\( F \\). This must be perpendicular to the surface, &c. &c. Nor will this mode of investigation ascertain the eccentricity of the spheroid without a most intricate process. We must therefore take the subject more generally, and show the proportion and directions of gravity in every point of the spheroid. We need not, however, again demonstrate that the gravitation of a particle placed anywhere without a perfect spherical shell, or a sphere consisting of concentric spherical shells, either of uniform density, or of densities varying according to some function of the radius, is the same as if the whole matter of the shell or sphere were collected in the centre. This has been demonstrated in the article Astronomy. We need only remind the reader of some consequences of this theorem which are of continual use in the present investigation.\n\n1. The gravitation to a sphere is proportional to its quantity of matter directly, and to the square of the distance of its centre from the gravitating particle inversely.\n\n2. If the spheres be homogeneous and of the same density, the gravitations of particles placed on their surfaces, or at distances which are proportional to their diameters, are as the radii; for the quantities of matter are as the cubes of the radii, and the attractions are inversely as the squares of the radii; and therefore the whole gravitations are as \\( \\frac{r^3}{r^2} \\), or as \\( r \\).\n\n3. A particle placed within a sphere has no tendency to the matter of the shell which lies without it, because its tendency to any part is balanced by an opposite tendency to the opposite part. Therefore,\n\n4. A particle placed anywhere within a homogeneous sphere gravitates to its centre with a force proportional to its distance from it.\n\nIt is a much more difficult problem to determine the gravitation of particles to a spheroid. To do this in general terms, and for every situation of the particle, would require a train of proportions which our limits will by no means admit; we must content ourselves with as much as is necessary for merely ascertaining the ratio of the axes. This will be obtained by knowing the ratio of the gravitation at the pole to that at the equator. Therefore,\n\nLet \\( NmSgN \\) (fig. 2.) be a section through the axis of an oblate homogeneous spheroid, which differs very little from a sphere. \\( NS \\) is the axis, \\( mg \\) is the equatorial diameter, \\( O \\) is the centre, and \\( NMSQ \\) is the section of the inscribed sphere. Let \\( P \\) be a particle situated at any distance without the sphere in its axis produced; it is required to determine the gravitation of this particle to the whole matter of the spheroid?\n\nDraw two lines \\( PAC, PBD \\), very near to each other, cutting off two small arches \\( AB, CD \\); draw \\( GAa, HBb, ICc, KDd \\), perpendicular to the axis; also draw \\( OE \\) and \\( AL \\) perpendicular to \\( PAC \\), and \\( OF \\) perpendicular to \\( PD \\), cutting \\( PC \\) in \\( f \\). Join \\( OA \\).\n\nLet \\( OA \\), the radius of the inscribed sphere be \\( r \\), and \\( OP \\) the distance of the gravitating particle be \\( d \\), and \\( Mm \\), the elevation of the equator of the spheroid, Tide, or the ellipticity, be \\( e \\). Also make \\( AE = x \\), and \\( OE = y = \\sqrt{r^2 - x^2} \\). Then \\( AE - BF = x \\) and \\( Ff = y \\),\n\n\\[ \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}} \\]\n\nSuppose the whole figure to turn round the axis \\( OP \\). The little space \\( ABba \\) will generate a ring of the redundant matter; so will \\( CDdc \\). This ring may be considered as consisting of a number of thin rings generated by the revolution of \\( Aa \\). The ring generated by \\( Aa \\) is equal to a parallelogram whose base is the circumference described by \\( A \\) and whose height is \\( Aa \\). Therefore let \\( c \\) be the circumference of a circle whose radius is \\( 1 \\). The ring will be \\( Aa \\times c \\times AG \\). But because \\( maN \\) is an arch of an ellipse, we have \\( MM : Aa = MO : AG = r : AG \\), and \\( Aa = MM \\times \\frac{AG}{r} = \\frac{e}{r} \\times AG \\). Therefore the surface of this ring is \\( = \\frac{e}{r} \\times AG^2 \\).\n\nWe have supposed the spheroid to be very nearly spherical, that is, \\( e \\) exceedingly small in comparison of \\( r \\). This being the case, all the particles in \\( Aa \\), and consequently all the particles in the ring generated by the revolution of \\( Aa \\), will attract the remote particle \\( P \\) with the same force that \\( A \\) does very nearly. We may say the same thing of the whole matter of the ring generated by the revolution of \\( ABba \\). This attraction is exerted in the direction \\( PA \\) by each individual particle. But every action of a particle \\( A \\) is accompanied by the action of a particle \\( A' \\) in the direction \\( PA' \\). These two compose an attraction in the direction \\( PO \\). The whole attraction in the directions similar to \\( PA \\) is \\( = \\frac{e}{r} \\times AG^2 \\times GH \\), for \\( GH \\) measures the number of parallel plates of which the solid ring is composed. This being decomposed in the direction \\( PG \\) is \\( = \\frac{e}{r} \\times AG^2 \\times PG \\times GH \\). But \\( \\frac{AG^2}{PA^2} \\times \\frac{OE^2}{PO^2} \\times GH \\). Therefore the attraction of the ring, estimated in the direction \\( PO \\), is \\( = \\frac{e}{r} \\times \\frac{AG^2}{PA^2} \\times \\frac{OE^2}{PO^2} \\times GH \\).\n\nFurther, by the nature of the circle, we have \\( HG : AB = AG : AO \\); also \\( AB : BL = AO : OE \\). But \\( PA : AG = PO : OE \\), and \\( OE = \\frac{AG \\times PO}{PA} \\). Therefore\n\n\\[ AB : BL = AO : \\frac{AG \\times PO}{PA}, = AO \\cdot PA : PO \\cdot AG \\]\n\nAlso \\( BL : LA = EO : EA \\),\n\nAnd \\( LA : Ff = PA : Pf = ultimately PA : PE \\).\n\nTherefore, by equality, \\( HG : Ff = AG \\cdot AO \\cdot PA \\cdot EO \\cdot PA : AO \\cdot PO \\cdot AG \\cdot EA \\cdot PE \\).\n\nOr \\( HG : Ff = EO \\cdot PA^2 : PO \\cdot EA \\cdot PE \\).\n\nAnd \\( HG = Ff \\times \\frac{EO \\cdot PA^2}{PO \\cdot PE \\cdot EA} \\).\n\nNow substitute this value of \\( HG \\) in the formula expressing the attraction of the ring. This changes it to\n\n\\[ \\frac{e}{r} \\times \\frac{OE^2 \\cdot PE}{PO^2} \\times \\frac{OE \\cdot PA^2}{PO \\cdot PE \\cdot EA} \\times Ff, \\text{ or } \\frac{e}{r} \\times \\frac{OE^2 \\cdot PA^2}{PO^4 \\cdot EA} \\times Ff. \\]\n\nIn like manner, the attraction of the\nthe ring generated by the revolution of CD \\( \\frac{c}{r} \\times OE^3 \\cdot PC^3 \\cdot PO^4 \\cdot EA \\times Ff \\). Therefore the attraction of both is\n\n\\[ = c \\frac{e}{r} \\times Ff \\times OE^3 \\cdot PA^3 + PC^3 = c \\frac{e}{r} \\times Ff \\times \\frac{y^2}{x^2} \\times PA^3 + PC^3. \\]\n\nBut \\( PA^3 + PC^3 = 2PE^3 + 2EA^3 = 2PE^3 + 2x^3 \\). Therefore the attraction is\n\n\\[ 2c \\frac{e}{r} \\times Ff \\times \\frac{y^2}{x^2} \\times PE^3 + x^3. \\]\n\nBut \\( Ff = y = \\frac{x}{z} \\).\n\nTherefore \\( Ff \\frac{y^2}{x} = \\frac{x}{y} \\times \\frac{y^2}{x} = y^2 \\times \\frac{x}{y} = r^2 - x^2 \\times \\frac{x}{y} \\).\n\nTherefore the attraction of the two rings is\n\n\\[ 2c \\frac{e}{r} \\times \\frac{y^2}{x^2} \\times PE^3 + x^3. \\]\n\nBut \\( PE^3 = PO^3 - OE^3 = d^3 - (r^3 - x^3) = d^3 - r^3 + x^3 \\). Therefore the attraction of the two rings is\n\n\\[ 2c \\frac{e}{r} \\times \\frac{y^2}{x^2} \\times d^3 - r^3 + x^3. \\]\n\nThe attraction of the whole shell of redundant matter will be had by taking the fluent of this formula, which is\n\n\\[ 2c \\frac{e}{r} \\times \\left( r^3 d^3 + \\frac{3}{3} r^2 x^3 - r^4 x - \\frac{d^3 x^3}{3} - \\frac{2x^5}{5} \\right), \\]\n\nand then make \\( x = r \\). This gives \\( 2c \\frac{e}{r} \\times \\left( d^3 r^3 + r^5 - r^5 - \\frac{1}{3} d^3 r^3 - \\frac{1}{3} r^5 \\right) \\), which is \\( 2c \\frac{e}{r} \\times \\left( \\frac{4}{3} r^5 - \\frac{4}{5} r^5 \\right) \\),\n\n\\[ = \\frac{4}{3} c e r^3 - \\frac{4}{5} r^5. \\]\n\nTo this add the attraction of the inscribed sphere, which is \\( \\frac{4}{3} c e r^3 \\), and we have the attraction of the whole spheroid\n\n\\[ = \\frac{4}{3} c e r^3 + \\frac{4}{3} c e r^3 - \\frac{4}{5} c e r^5. \\]\n\nCor. 1. If the particle P is situated precisely in N, the pole of the spheroid, the attraction of the spheroid is \\( \\frac{4}{3} c e r + \\frac{8}{3} c e \\).\n\nIf the spheroid is not oblate, but oblong, and if the greater semi-axis be \\( r \\), and the depression at the equator be \\( e \\), the analysis is the same, taking \\( e \\) negatively. Therefore the attraction for a particle in the pole, or the gravitation of a particle in the pole, is \\( \\frac{4}{3} c e r - \\frac{8}{3} c e \\).\n\nBut if the polar semi-axis be \\( r + e \\), and the equatorial radius be \\( r \\), so that this oblong spheroid has the same axis with the former oblate one, the gravitation of a particle in the pole is \\( \\frac{4}{3} c e r + \\frac{8}{3} c e \\).\n\nCor. 2. If a number of parallel planes are drawn perpendicular to the equator of an oblong spheroid, whose longer semi-axis is \\( r + e \\), and equatorial radius \\( r \\), they will divide the spheroid into a number of similar ellipses; and since the ellipse through the axis has \\( r + e \\) and \\( r \\) for its two semi-axes, and the radius of a circle of equal area with this ellipse is a mean proportional between \\( r \\) and \\( r + e \\), and therefore very nearly \\( r + \\frac{1}{2} e \\), when \\( e \\) is very small in comparison of \\( r \\), a particle on the equator of the oblong spheroid will be as much attracted by these circles of equal areas, with their corresponding ellipses, as by the ellipses. Now the attraction at the pole of an oblate spheroid was \\( \\frac{4}{3} c e r + \\frac{8}{3} c e \\). Therefore putting \\( \\frac{1}{2} e \\) in place of \\( e \\), the attraction on the equator of the oblong spheroid will be equal to \\( \\frac{4}{3} c r + \\frac{8}{3} c e \\).\n\nThus we have ascertained the gravitations of a particle situated in the pole, and of one situated in the equator, of a homogeneous oblong spheroid. This will enable us to solve the following problem:\n\nIf the particles of a homogeneous oblong fluid spheroid attract each other with a force inversely as the squares of their distances, and if they are attracted by a very distant body by the same law, and if the ratio of the equatorial gravity to this external force be given; to find what must be the proportion of the semi-axis, so that all may be in equilibrium, and the spheroid preserve its form?\n\nLet \\( r \\) be the equatorial radius, and \\( r + e \\) be the polar semi-axis. Then the gravitation at the pole \\( m \\) is \\( \\frac{4}{3} c e r + \\frac{8}{3} c e \\), and the gravitation at the equator is \\( \\frac{4}{3} c r + \\frac{8}{3} c e \\). Now by the gravitation towards the distant body placed in the direction of the polar axis, the polar gravitation is diminished, and the equatorial gravitation is increased; and the increase of the equatorial gravitation is to the diminution of the polar gravitation as NO to \\( 2mO \\). Therefore if the whole attraction of the oblong spheroid for a particle on its equator be to the force which the distant body exerts there, as G to P, and if the spheroid is very nearly spherical, the absolute weight at the equator will be \\( \\frac{4}{3} c e r + \\frac{8}{3} c e + \\frac{4}{3} c e r \\cdot \\frac{P}{G} \\). And the absolute weight at the pole will be \\( \\frac{4}{3} c e r + \\frac{8}{3} c e - \\frac{4}{3} c e r \\cdot \\frac{P}{G} \\). Their difference is \\( \\frac{4}{3} c e r + 2c e r \\cdot \\frac{P}{G} \\).\n\nNow if we suppose this spheroid to be composed of similar concentric shells, all the forces will decrease in the same ratio. Therefore the weight of a particle in a column reaching from the equator to the centre will be to the weight of a similarly situated particle of a column reaching from the pole to the centre, as the weight of a particle at the equator to the weight of a particle at the pole. But the whole weights of the two columns must be equal, that they may balance each other at the centre. Their lengths must therefore be reciprocally as the weights of similarly situated particles; that is, the polar semi-axis must be to the equatorial radius, as the weight of a particle at the equator to the weight of a particle at the pole. Therefore we must have \\( \\frac{4}{3} c e + 2c e r \\cdot \\frac{P}{G} : \\frac{4}{3} c e + \\frac{8}{3} c e - \\frac{4}{3} c e r \\cdot \\frac{P}{G} = e : r \\).\n\nHence we derive \\( 2c e r \\cdot \\frac{P}{G} = \\frac{8}{3} c e \\), or \\( 4G : 15P = r : e \\).\n\nThis determines the form of the fluid spheroid when the ratio of G to P is given.\n\nIt is well known that the gravitation of the moon to the earth is to the disturbing force of the sun as 178,725 to 1 very nearly. The lunar gravitation is increased as the approaches the earth in the reciprocal duplicate ratio of the distances. The disturbing force of the sun diminishes in the simple ratio of the distances; therefore the weight of a body on the surface of the earth is to the disturbing...\ndisturbing force of the sun on the same body, in a ratio compounded of the ratio of \\(178,725\\) to \\(1\\), the ratio of \\(3600\\) to \\(1\\), and the ratio of \\(62\\) to \\(1\\); that is, in the ratio of \\(38604600\\) to \\(1\\). If the mean radius of the earth be \\(29934500\\) feet, the difference of the axis, or the elevation of the pole of the watery spheroid produced by the gravitation to the sun, will be \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{178,725} \\times \\frac{1}{3600} \\times \\frac{1}{62}\\) feet, or very nearly \\(2\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches. This is the tide produced by the sun on a homogeneous fluid sphere.\n\nIt is plain, that if the earth consists of a solid nucleus of the same density with the water, the form of the solar tide will be the same. But if the density of the nucleus be different, the form of the tide will be different, and will depend both on the density and on the figure of the nucleus.\n\nIf the nucleus be of the same form as the surrounding fluid, the whole will still maintain its form with the same proportion of the axis. If the nucleus be spherical, its action on the surrounding fluid will be the same as if all the matter of the nucleus by which it exceeds an equal bulk of the fluid were collected at the centre. In this case, the ocean cannot maintain the same form; for the action of this central body being proportional to the square of the distance inversely, will augment the gravity of the equatorial fluid more than it augments that of the circumpolar fluid; and the ocean, which was in equilibrium (by supposition), must now become more protuberant at the poles. It may, however, be again balanced in an elliptical form, when it has acquired a just proportion of the axes. The process for determining this is tedious, but precisely similar to the preceding.\n\nIf the density of the nucleus exceed that of the fluid about \\(\\frac{1}{52}\\), we shall have \\(r : e = G : 3P\\), which is nearly the form which has been determined for the earth, by the mensuration of degrees of the meridian, and by the vibration of pendulums. The curious reader will do well to consult the excellent dissertations by Clairaut and Boscovich on the Figure of the Earth, where this curious problem is treated in the most complete manner. Mr Bernoulli, in his dissertation on the Tides, has committed a great mistake in this particular. On the other hand, if the nucleus be less dense than the waters, or if there be a great central hollow, the elevation produced by the sun will exceed \\(2\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches.\n\nIt is needless to examine this any farther. We have collected enough for explaining the chief affections of the tides.\n\nIt is known that the earth is not a sphere, but swelled out at the equator by the diurnal rotation. But the change of form is so very small in proportion to the whole bulk, that it cannot sensibly affect the change of form afterwards induced by the sun on the waters of the ocean. For the disturbing force of the sun would produce a certain protuberance on a fluid sphere; and this protuberance depends on the ratio of the disturbing force to the force of gravity at the surface of this sphere. If the gravity be changed in any proportion, the protuberance will change in the same proportion. Therefore if the body be a spheroid, the protuberance produced at any point by the sun will increase or diminish in the same proportion that the gravity at this point has been changed by the change of form. Now the change of gravity, even at the pole of the terrestrial spheroid, is extremely small in comparison with the whole gravity.\n\nTherefore the change produced on the spheroid will not sensibly differ from that produced on the sphere; and the elevations of the waters above the surface, which they would have assumed independent of the sun's action, will be the same on the spheroid as on the sphere. For the same reason, the moon will change the surface already changed by the sun, in the same manner as she would have changed the surface of the undisturbed ocean. Therefore the change produced by both these luminaries in any place will be the same when acting together as when acting separately; and it will be equal to the sum, or the difference of their separate changes, according as these would have been in the same or opposite directions.\n\nLet us now consider the most interesting circumstance of the form of an elliptical tide, which differs very little from a sphere.\n\nLet \\(T\\) (fig. 2.) be a point in the surface of the inscribed sphere, and let \\(Z\\) express the angular distance \\(TOQ\\) from the longer axis of the surrounding spheroid \\(S_{m}N_{q}\\). Let \\(TR, TW\\) be perpendicular to the equatorial diameter and to the axis, so that they are the cosine and the sine of \\(TOQ\\) to the radius \\(TO\\) or \\(OQ\\).\n\nLet \\(S_{q}N_{q}\\) be a section of the circumscribed sphere. Draw \\(OT\\) cutting the spheroid in \\(Z\\) and the circumscribed sphere in \\(r\\). Also let \\(s_{o}n\\) be a section of a sphere which has the same capacity with the spheroid, and let it cut the radius in \\(r\\). Then,\n\n1. The elevation \\(TZ\\) of the point \\(Z\\) of the spheroid above the inscribed sphere is \\(= Q_{q} \\times \\text{cof}^{2} Z\\), and the depression \\(TZ\\) below the circumscribed sphere is \\(= Q_{q} \\times \\text{fin}^{2} Z\\).\n\n2. Produce \\(RT\\) till it meet the surface of the spheroid in \\(V\\). The minute triangle \\(VTZ\\) may be considered as rectilineal, right-angled at \\(Z\\), and therefore similar to \\(O'TR\\). Therefore \\(OT : TR = TV : TZ\\). But in the ellipse \\(OQ\\), or \\(OT : TR = Q_{q} : TV\\). Therefore \\(OT^{2} : TR^{2} = Q_{q} : TZ\\), and \\(TZ = \\frac{Q_{q} \\cdot TR^{2}}{OT^{2}}\\).\n\nAnd in the very same manner it may be shown, that \\(TZ = Q_{q} \\times \\text{fin}^{2} Z\\).\n\n3. The elevation of the point \\(T\\) above another point \\(T'\\), whose angular distance \\(TOT'\\) from the point \\(T\\) is \\(90^{\\circ}\\), is \\(= Q_{q} \\times \\text{cof}^{2} Z - \\text{fin}^{2} Z\\). Call the angle \\(OQI'\\) \\(Z'\\). Then \\(I'Z' = Q_{q} \\times \\text{cof}^{2} Z'\\), and \\(TZ - T'Z', Z' = Q_{q} \\times \\text{cof}^{2} Z - \\text{fin}^{2} Z'\\). But the arch \\(QT'\\) is the complement of \\(Q'T\\), and therefore \\(\\text{cof}^{2} Z' = \\text{fin}^{2} Z\\). Therefore \\(TZ - T'Z' = Q_{q} \\times \\text{cof}^{2} Z - \\text{fin}^{2} Z\\).\n\n4. \\(Q_{q} = \\frac{1}{2} Q_{q}\\). For the inscribed sphere is to the spheroid as \\(OQ\\) to \\(O_{q}\\). But the inscribed sphere is to the sphere \\(s_{o}n\\) as \\(OQ^{3}\\) to \\(O_{q}^{3}\\). Therefore because the sphere \\(s_{o}n\\) is equal to the spheroid \\(S_{q}N_{q}\\), we have \\(OQ : O_{q} = OQ^{3} : O_{q}^{3}\\), and \\(O_{q}\\) is the first of two mean proportions between \\(OQ\\) and \\(O_{q}\\). But \\(Q_{q}\\) is very small in comparison with \\(OQ\\). Therefore \\(Q_{q}\\) is very nearly \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) of \\(Q_{q}\\).\n\nSince \\(s_{o}n\\) is the sphere of equal capacity, it is the form of the undisturbed ocean. The best way therefore of conceiving the changes of form produced by the sun or moon, or by both together, is to consider the elevations or depressions which they produce above or below this surface. Therefore, .\nThe elevation \\( rZ \\) of the point \\( Z \\) above the equi-\ncapacious sphere is evidently \\( = Q \\times \\cos^2 Z - \\frac{1}{4} Q \\times q \\).\nAlso the depression \\( r'Z' \\) of the point \\( Z' \\) is \\( = Q \\times \\sin^2 Z' - \\frac{3}{4} Q \\times q \\).\n\nN.B. Either of these formulae will answer for either\nthe elevation above, or the depression below, the natural\nocean: For if \\( \\cos^2 Z \\) is less than \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\), the elevation given\nby the formula will be negative; that is, the point is\nbelow the natural surface. In like manner, when\n\\( \\sin^2 Z' \\) is less than \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\), the depression is negative, and\nthe point is above the surface. But if \\( \\cos^2 Z \\) be \\( = \\frac{1}{4} \\), or\n\\( \\sin^2 Z' \\) be \\( = \\frac{3}{4} \\), the point is in the natural surface.\n\nThis marks the place where the spheroid and the equal sphere\nintersect each other, viz. in \\( P' \\); the arch \\( P'o \\) being\n\\( 54^\\circ 44' \\) very nearly, and \\( PS = 35^\\circ 16' \\).\n\nLet \\( S \\) represent the whole elevation of the pole of the\nsolar tide above its equator, or the difference between\nhigh and low water produced by the sun; and let \\( M \\)\nrepresent the whole elevation produced by the moon.\n\nLet \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) represent the zenith distances of the sun\nand moon with respect to any point whatever on the\nocean. Then \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) will be the arches intercepted\nbetween that point and the summits of the solar and\nlunar tides. Then the elevation produced by both lu-\nminaries in that plane is \\( S \\cdot \\cos^2 x + M \\cdot \\cos^2 y -\n\\frac{1}{4} M \\); or, more concisely, \\( S \\cdot \\cos^2 x + M \\cdot \\cos^2 y -\n\\frac{1}{4} S + M \\), and the depression is \\( S \\cdot \\sin^2 x + M \\cdot \\sin^2 y -\n\\frac{3}{4} S + M \\).\n\nLet the sun and moon be in the same point of the\nheavens. The solar and lunar tides will have the same\naxis; the cosines of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) will each be \\( 1 \\), and the\nelevation at the compound pole will be \\( S + M - \\frac{1}{4} S +\nM = \\frac{3}{4} S + M \\). The depression at any point \\( 90^\\circ \\)\nfrom this pole will be \\( \\frac{1}{4} S + M \\), and the whole tide is\n\\( S + M \\).\n\nLet the moon be in quadrature, as in \\( a \\) (fig. 3.). The\nappearance at \\( s \\) will be known, by considering that in\nthis place the cosine of \\( x \\) is \\( 1 \\), and the cosine of \\( y \\) is \\( 0 \\).\nTherefore the elevation at \\( s = S - \\frac{1}{4} S + M = \\frac{3}{4} S - \\frac{1}{4} M \\).\nThe depression at \\( a = S - \\frac{3}{4} S + M = \\frac{1}{4} S - \\frac{3}{4} M \\).\nThe difference or whole tide \\( = S - M \\).\n\nIn like manner, the whole elevation at \\( a \\) above the in-\nscribed sphere is \\( M - S \\).\n\nHence we see that the whole tide, when the moon is\nin quadrature, is the difference of \\( S \\) and \\( M \\). We also\nsee, that if \\( M \\) exceeds \\( S \\), the water will be higher at \\( a \\)\nthan at \\( s \\). Now it is a matter of observation, that in\nthe quadratures it is high water under the moon, and low\nwater under the sun. It is also a matter of observation,\nthat in the free ocean, the ebb tide, or the water at \\( s \\),\nimmediately under the sun, is below the natural surface\nof the ocean. Hence we must conclude, that \\( \\frac{3}{4} S \\) is less\nthan \\( \\frac{1}{4} M \\), or that \\( M \\) is more than double of \\( S \\). This\nagrees with the phenomena of nutation and precession,\nwhich seem to make \\( S = \\frac{3}{4} M \\).\n\nIn all other positions of the sun and moon, the place\nof high water will be different. It is high water where\nthe sum of the elevations produced by both luminaries\nabove the natural ocean is greatest; and the place of\nlow water is where the depression below the natural\nocean is greatest. Therefore, in order that it may be\nhigh water, we must have \\( S \\cdot \\cos^2 x + M \\cdot \\cos^2 y -\n\\frac{1}{4} S + M \\) a maximum; or, neglecting the constant quan-\ntity \\( \\frac{S + M}{3} \\), we must have \\( S \\cdot \\cos^2 x + M \\cdot \\cos^2 y \\) a\nmaximum.\n\nIn like manner, to have low water in a place where\nthe zenith distances of the sun and moon are \\( v \\) and \\( w \\),\nwe must have \\( S \\cdot \\sin^2 v + M \\cdot \\sin^2 w \\) a maximum.\n\nLemma 1. If we consider the fines and cosines of\nangles as numeral fractions of the radius \\( 1 \\), then we\nhave \\( \\cos^2 Z = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} \\cos^2 Z \\), and \\( \\sin^2 Z = \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} \\cos^2 Z \\).\n\nLet \\( a \\) \\( m \\) (fig. 3.) be a quadrant of a circle of which\n\\( O \\) is the centre, and \\( O \\) \\( s \\) is the radius. On \\( O \\) \\( s \\) de-\nscribe the semicircle \\( OMS \\), cutting \\( O \\) \\( m \\) in \\( M \\). Draw\n\\( s \\) \\( M \\), and produce it till it cut the quadrant in \\( n \\).\nAlso draw \\( MC \\) to the centre of the semicircle, and \\( MD \\)\nand \\( d \\) perpendicular to \\( O \\) \\( s \\).\n\nIt is plain that \\( s \\) \\( M \\) is perpendicular to \\( OM \\); and if\n\\( O \\) \\( s \\) be radius, \\( s \\) \\( M \\) is the fine of the angle \\( s \\) \\( OM \\), which\nwe may call \\( Z \\); \\( OM \\) is its cosine: and because \\( O \\) \\( s \\):\n\\( OM = OD \\), and \\( O \\) \\( s \\): \\( OD = O \\) \\( s \\): \\( OM \\), and\n\\( OD \\) may represent \\( \\cos^2 Z \\). Now \\( OD = OC + CD \\).\nIf \\( O \\) \\( s = 1 \\), then \\( OC = \\frac{1}{2} \\), \\( CD = CM \\cdot \\cos MCD \\),\n\\( CM \\cdot \\cos MOD = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\cos 2Z \\). Therefore \\( \\cos^2 Z =\n\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} \\cos^2 2Z \\).\n\nIn like manner, because \\( O \\) \\( s \\): \\( s \\) \\( M = s \\) \\( M \\): \\( s \\) \\( D \\),\n\\( s \\) \\( D \\) is \\( = \\sin^2 Z \\). This is evidently \\( = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} \\cos^2 2Z \\).\n\nLemma 2. \\( \\cos^2 Z - \\sin^2 Z = \\cos^2 2Z \\). For, because\n\\( s \\) \\( M \\) is perpendicular to \\( OM \\), the arch \\( sn \\) is double of\nthe arch \\( sm \\), and because \\( MD \\) is parallel to \\( nd \\), \\( d \\) \\( s \\)\nis \\( = 2sD \\), and \\( dD = \\sin^2 Z \\). Therefore \\( O \\) \\( d = \\cos^2 Z -\n\\sin^2 Z \\). But \\( O \\) \\( d \\) is the cosine of \\( ns \\), \\( = \\cos^2 2Z \\) and\n\\( \\cos^2 Z = \\sin^2 Z = \\cos^2 2Z \\).\n\nBy the first Lemma we see, that in order that there\nmay be high water at any place, when the zenith dis-\ntances of the sun and moon are \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), we must have\n\\( S \\cdot \\cos^2 x + M \\cdot \\cos^2 y \\) a maximum.\n\nThat this may be the case, the fluxion of this formu-\nla must be \\( = 0 \\). Now we know that the fluxions of\nthe cosines of two arches are as the fines of those arches.\nTherefore we must have \\( S \\cdot \\sin^2 2x + M \\cdot \\sin^2 2y = 0 \\),\nor \\( S \\cdot \\sin^2 2x = M \\cdot \\sin^2 2y \\), which gives us \\( \\sin^2 2x:\n\\sin^2 2y = M : S \\).\n\nIn like manner, the place of low water requires \\( \\sin^2 2v :\n\\sin^2 2w = M : S \\).\n\nFrom this last circumstance we learn, that the place\nof low water is \\( o \\), removed \\( 90^\\circ \\) from the place of high\nwater; whereas we might have expected, that the spheroid\nwould have been most protuberant on that side on\nwhich the moon is: For the fines of \\( 2v \\) and of \\( 2w \\) have\nthe same proportion with the fines of \\( 2x \\) and of \\( 2y \\).\nNow we know that the fine of the double of any arch is\nthe same with the fine of the double of its complement.\nTherefore if low water be really distant \\( 90^\\circ \\) from high\nwater, we shall have \\( \\sin^2 2x : \\sin^2 2y = \\sin^2 2v : \\sin^2 2w \\).\nBut if it is at any other place, the fines cannot have this\nproportion.\n\nNow let \\( s \\) be the point of the earth's surface which\nhas the sun in the zenith, and \\( m \\) the point which has\nthe moon in the zenith. Let \\( h \\) be any other point.\nDraw \\( O \\) \\( h \\) cutting the semicircle \\( OMS \\) in \\( H \\). Make\n\\( CM \\) to \\( CS \\) as the disturbing force of the moon to that\nof the sun; and draw \\( Sw \\) parallel, and \\( S \\) \\( t \\), \\( Mr \\) per-\npendicular to \\( HH' \\). Join \\( MH \\) and \\( MH' \\). The angle\n\\( HCS \\) is double of the angle \\( HO \\) \\( s \\), and \\( MCH \\) is double\nof \\( MH'H \\), or of its equal \\( MOH \\). Because \\( HMH \\) is\na semicircle, \\( HM \\) is perpendicular to \\( MO \\). There-\nfore\nTide.\n\nfore if HH' be considered as radius, HM is the sine, and H'M is the cofine of MH'H. And C r is = MC \u00b7 cof. 2 y, = M \u00b7 cof. 2 y. And C r is SC \u00b7 cof. 2 x. Therefore tr or S v will express the whole difference of elevation between h and the points that are 90 degrees from it on either side (by Lemma 2.) ; and if h be the place of high water, it will express the whole tide, because the high and low waters were shown to be 90\u00b0 asunder. But when h is the place of high water, S v is a maximum. Because the place of the moon, and therefore the point M, is given, S v will be a maximum when it coincides with SM, and CH is parallel to SM.\n\nThis suggested to us the following new, and not inelegant, solution of the problem for determining the place of high water.\n\nLet s Q o q s (fig. 4. and 5.) be a section of the teraqueous globe, by a plane passing through the sun and moon, and let O be its centre. Let s be the point which is immediately under the sun, and m the place immediately under the moon. Bisect Os in C, and describe round C the circle OM s LO, cutting Om in M. Take C s to represent the disturbing force of the moon, and make C s to CS as the force of the moon to that of the sun (supposing this ratio to be known). Join MS, and draw CH parallel to it. Draw OH h, and lOL p perpendicular to it. And lastly, draw CI perpendicular to SM. Then we say that m and its opposite m' are the places of high water, l and l' are the places of low water, MS is the height of the tide, and MI, SI are the portions of this tide produced by the moon and sun.\n\nFor it is plain, that in this case the line S v of the last proposition coincides with MS, and is a maximum. We may also observe, that MC : CS = fin. MSC : fin. SMC, = fin. HCS : fin. MCH, = fin. 2 hO : fin. 2 hOm, = fin. 2 x : fin. 2 y, or M : S = fin. 2 x : fin. 2 y, agreeably to what was required for the maximum.\n\nIt is also evident, that MI = MC \u00b7 cof. CMI, = M \u00b7 cof. 2 y, and SI = SC \u00b7 cof. ISC, = S \u00b7 cof. 2 x; and therefore MS is the difference of elevation between h and the points l and l', which are 90\u00b0 from it, and is therefore the place of low water; that is, MS is the whole tide.\n\nThe elevation of every other point may be determined in the same way, and thus may the form of the spheroid be completely determined.\n\nIf we suppose the figure to represent a section through the earth's equator (which is the case when the sun and moon are in the equator), and farther suppose the two luminaries to be in conjunction, the ocean is an oblong spheroid, whose axis is in the line of the syzygies, and whose equator coincides with the six hour circle. But if the moon be in any other point of the equator, the figure of the ocean will be very complicated. It will not be any figure of revolution; because neither its equator (or most depressed part) nor its meridians are circles. The most depressed part of its equator will be in that section through the axis which is perpendicular to the plane in which the luminaries are situated. And this greatest depression, and its shortest equatorial diameter, will be constant, while its other dimensions vary with the moon's place. We need not inquire more minutely into its form; and it is sufficient to know that all the flections perpendicular to the plane passing through the sun and moon are ellipses.\n\nThis construction will afford us a very simple, and, we hope, a very perspicuous explanation of the chief phenomena of the tides. The well informed reader will be pleased with observing its coincidence with the algebraic solution of the problem given by Daniel Bernoulli, in his excellent dissertation on the Tides, which shared with M. Laurin and Euler the prize given by the Academy of Sciences at Paris, and with the ease and perspicuity with which the phenomena are deducible from it, being in some sort exhibited to the eye.\n\nIn our application, we shall begin with the simplest cases, and gradually introduce the complicating circumstances which accommodate the theory to the true state of things.\n\nWe begin, therefore, by supposing the earth covered, to a proper depth, with water, forming an ocean concentric with its solid nucleus.\n\nIn the next place, we suppose that this ocean adopts in an instant the form which is consistent with the equilibrium of gravity and the disturbing forces.\n\nThirdly, We suppose the sun stationary, and the moon to move eastward from him above 12\u00b0 every day.\n\nFourthly, We suppose that the solid nucleus turns round its proper axis to the eastward, making a rotation in 24 solar hours. Thus any place of observation will successively experience all the different depths of water.\n\nThus we shall obtain a certain succession of phenomena, precisely similar to the succession observed in nature, with this sole difference, that they do not correspond to the contemporaneous situations of the sun and moon. When we shall have accounted for this difference, we shall presume to think that we have given a just theory of the tides.\n\nWe begin with the simplest case, supposing the sun and moon to be always in the equator. Let the series begin with the sun and moon in conjunction in the line Os. In this case the points s, m, and h coincide, and we have high water at 12 o'clock noon and midnight.\n\nWhile the moon moves from s to Q, Om cuts the upper semicircle in M; and therefore CH, which is always parallel to MS, lies between MC and C r. Therefore h is between m and s, and we have high water after 12 o'clock, but before the moon's setting. The same thing happens while the moon moves from o to q, during her third quarter.\n\nBut while the moon moves from her first quadrature in Q to opposition in o (as in fig. 5.), the line mO drawn from the moon's place, cuts the lower semicircle in M and CH, parallel to SM, again lies between M and s, and therefore h lies between m and o. The place of high water is to the eastward of the moon, and we have high water after the moon's setting. The same thing happens while the moon is moving from her last quadrature in q to the next syzygy. In short, the point H is always between M and s, and the place of high water is always between the moon and the nearest syzygy. The place of high water overtakes the moon in each quadrature, and is overtaken by the moon in each syzygy. Therefore during the first and third quarters, the place of high water gradually falls behind the moon for some time, and then gains upon her again, fo\nThis is always greater than a solar day, or 24 hours, because the place of high water is moving faster to the eastward than the sun. It is less than a lunar day, or 24 h. 50', while the high water passes from the second to the third octant, or from the fourth to the first. It is equal to a lunar day when high water is in the octants, and it exceeds a lunar day while high water passes from the first to the second octant, or from the third to the fourth.\n\nThe difference between a solar day and a tide day is called the priming or the retardation of the tides. This is evidently equal to the time of the earth's describing in its rotation an angle equal to the motion of the high water in a day from the sun. The smallest of these retardations is the greatest as the difference of the disturbing forces to their sum. Of all the phenomena of the tides, this seems liable to the fewest and most inconceivable derangements from local and accidental circumstances. It therefore affords the best means for determining the proportion of the disturbing forces. By a comparison of a great number of observations made by Dr Maskelyne at St Helena, and at Barbadoes (places situated in the open sea), it appears that the shortest tide day is 24 h. 37', and the longest is 25 h. 27'. This gives M : S = 37 : 87, and S : M = 2 : 4.96; which differs only 1 part in 124 from the proportion of 2 to 5, which Daniel Bernoulli collected from a variety of different observations. We shall therefore adopt the proportion of 2 to 5 as abundantly exact. It also agrees exactly with the phenomena of the nutation of the earth's axis and the precession of the equinoxes; and the astronomers affect to have deduced this proportion from these phenomena. But an intelligent reader of their writings will perceive more fitness than justice in this assertion. The nutation and precession do not afford phenomena of which we can assign the share to each luminary with sufficient precision for determining the proportion of their disturbing forces; and it is by means of many arbitrary combinations, and without necessity, that D'Alembert has made out this ratio. We cannot help being of opinion, that D'Alembert has accommodated his distribution of the phenomena to this ratio of 2 to 5, which Daniel Bernoulli (the best philosopher and the most candid man of that illustrious family of mathematicians) had, with so much sagacity and justness of inference, deduced from the phenomena of the tides. D'Alembert could not but see the value of this inference; but he wanted to show his own address in deducing it proprio merito forsooth from the nutation and precession. His procedure in this resembles that of his no less vain countryman De la Place, who affects to be highly pleased with finding that Mr Bode's discovery that Meyer had seen the Georgium Sidus in 1756, perfectly agreed with the theory of its motions which he (De la Place) had deduced from his own doctrines. Any well informed mathematician will see, that De la Place's data afforded no such precision; and the book on the Elliptical Motions of the Planets, to which he alludes, contains no grounds for his inference. This observation we owe to the author of a paper on that subject in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. We hope that our readers will excuse this occasional observation, by which we wish to do justice to the merit of a modest man, and one of the greatest philosophers of his time. Our only claim in the present dissertation is the making his excellent performance\nAssuming \\(2:5\\) as the ratio of SC to CM', we have the angle CM'S = 23\u00b0 34' nearly, and m'o'h' = 11\u00b0 47'; and this is the greatest difference between the moon's place and the place of high water. And when this obtains, the moon's elongation m'o's is 56\u00b0 47' from the nearest syzygy. Hence it follows, that while the moon moves uniformly from 56\u00b0 47' west elongation to 56\u00b0 47' east, or from 123\u00b0 13' east to 123\u00b0 13' west, the tide day is shorter than the lunar day; and while she moves from 56\u00b0 47' east to 123\u00b0 13', or from 123\u00b0 13' west to 56\u00b0 47', the tide-day is longer than the lunar day.\n\nWe now see the reason why\n\nThe swelling tides obey the moon.\n\nThe time of high water, when the sun and moon are in the equator, is never more than 47 minutes different from that of the moon's fouthing (+ or \u2014 a certain fixed quantity, to be determined once for all by observation).\n\nIt is now an easy matter to determine the hour of high water corresponding to any position of the sun and moon in the equator. Suppose that on the noon of a certain day the moon's distance from the sun is \\(m\\). The construction of this problem gives us \\(s_h\\), and the length of the tide-day. Call this \\(T\\). Then lay \\(360^\\circ : s_m = T : t_s\\), and \\(t_s\\) is the hour of high water.\n\nOr, if we choose to refer the time of high water to the moon's fouthing, we must find the value of \\(m_h\\) at the time of the moon's fouthing, and the difference \\(d\\) between the tide-day and a mean lunar day \\(L\\), and say \\(360 : m_h = d : \\delta\\), the time of high water before the moon's fouthing in the first and third quarters, but after it in the second and fourth. The following table by Daniel Bernoulli exhibits these times for every 10th degree of the moon's elongation from the sun. The first or leading column is the moon's elongation from the sun or from the point of opposition. The second column is the minutes of time between the moon's fouthing and the place of high water. The marks \u2014 and + distinguish whether the high water is before or after the moon's fouthing. The third column is the hour and minute of high water. But we must remark, that the first column exhibits the elongation, not on the noon of any day, but at the very time of high water. The two remaining columns express the heights of the tides and their daily variations.\n\nThe height of high water above the low water constitutes what is usually called the tide. This is the interfering circumstance in practice. Many circumstances render it almost impossible to say what is the elevation of high water above the natural surface of the ocean. In many places the surface at low water is above the natural surface of the ocean. This is the case in rivers at a great distance from their mouths. This may appear absurd, and is certainly very paradoxical; but it is a fact established on the most unexceptionable authority.\n\nOne instance fell under our own observation. The low-water mark at spring tide in the harbour of Alloa was found by accurate levelling to be three feet higher than the top of the stone pier at Leith, which is several feet above the high-water mark of this harbour. A little attention to the motion of running waters will explain this completely. Whatever checks the motion of water in a canal must raise its surface. Water in a canal runs only in consequence of the declivity of this surface: (See River). Therefore a flood tide coming to the mouth of a river checks the current of its waters, and they accumulate at the mouth. This checks the current farther up, and therefore the waters accumulate there also; and this checking of the stream, and consequent rising of the waters, is gradually communicated up the river to a great distance. The water rises everywhere, though its surface still has a slope. In the mean time, the flood tide at the mouth passes by, and an ebb succeeds. This must accelerate even the ordinary course of the river. It will more remarkably accelerate the river now raised above its ordinary level, because the declivity at the mouth will be so much greater. Therefore the waters near the mouth, by accelerating, will sink in their channel, and increase the declivity of the canal beyond them. This will accelerate the waters beyond them; and thus a stream more rapid than ordinary will be produced along the whole river.\nriver, and the waters will sink below their ordinary level. Thus there will be an ebb below the ordinary surface as well as a flood above it, however flopping that surface may be.\n\nHence it follows, that we cannot tell what is the natural surface of the ocean by any observations made in a river, even though near its mouth. Yet even in rivers we have regular tides, subjected to all the varieties deduced from this theory.\n\nWe have seen that the tide is always proportional to MS. It is greatest therefore when the moon is in conjunction or opposition, being then S, the sum of the separate tides produced by the sun and moon. It gradually decreases as the moon approaches to quadrature; and when she is at Q or q, it is SO, or the difference of the separate tides. Supposing S divided into 100 equal parts, the length of MS is expressed in these parts in the fourth column of the foregoing table, and their differences are expressed in the fifth column.\n\nWe may here observe, that the variations of the tides in equal small times are proportional to the sine of twice the distance of the place of high water from the moon. For since M is a constant quantity, on the supposition of the moon's uniform motion, Mv is proportional to the variation of MS. Now M : Mv = MC : CI = 1 : fin. 2y, and M and MC are constant quantities.\n\nThus we have seen with what ease the geometrical construction of this problem not only explains all the interesting circumstances of the tides, but also points them out, almost without employing the judgement, and exhibits to the eye the gradual progress of each phenomenon. In these respects it has great advantages over the very elegant algebraic analysis of Mr Bernoulli. In that process we advance almost without ideas, and obtain our solutions as detached facts, without perceiving their regular series. This is the usual pre-eminence of geometrical analysis; and we regret that Mr Bernoulli, who was eminent in this branch, did not rather employ it. We doubt not but that he would have shown still more clearly the connection and gradual progress of every particular. His aim, however, being to instruct those who were to calculate tables of the different affections of the tides, he adhered to the algebraic method. Unfortunately it did not present him with the easiest formulae for practice. But the geometrical construction which we have given suggests several formul\u00e6 which are exceedingly simple, and afford a very ready mode of calculation.\n\nThe fundamental problems are to determine the angle SOh or mOh, having mO given; and to determine MS.\n\nLet the given angle mO be called a; and, to avoid the ambiguity of algebraic signs, let it always be reckoned from the nearest fzygy, so that we may always have a equal to the sum of x and y. Also make\n\n\\[ S^2 \\times \\text{fin.}^2 a \\]\n\nwhich represents the\n\n\\[ S^2 + S^2 + 2MS \\times \\text{col.}^2 a \\]\n\nof fig. 4, or fin. 2y, and make \\( p = \\frac{S \\times \\text{fin.}^2 a}{M + S \\times \\text{col.}^2 a} \\),\n\nwhich is the expression of \\( \\frac{S}{MC} \\) of that figure, or of tan. 2y. Then we shall have,\n\n\\[ \\sin y = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - d^2}{2}} \\]\n\nFor we shall have col.\n\n\\[ 2y = \\sqrt{1 - d^2} \\]\n\nBut fin. 2y = \\( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} \\text{col.} 2y = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{1 - d^2} \\)\n\nand fin. \\( y = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - d^2}{2}} \\).\n\n2. Tan. \\( y = \\frac{p}{1 + \\sqrt{1 + p^2}} \\). For because \\( p \\) is tan. \\( y \\), \\( \\sqrt{1 + p^2} \\) is the secant of \\( 2y \\), and \\( 1 + \\sqrt{1 + p^2} : x = p : \\tan y \\).\n\nThese processes for obtaining \\( y \\) directly are abundantly simple. But it will be much more expeditious and easy to content ourselves with obtaining \\( 2y \\) by means of the value of its tangent, viz. \\( \\frac{S \\times \\text{fin.}^2 a}{M + S \\times \\text{col.}^2 a} \\).\n\nOr, we may find \\( x \\) by means of the similar value of its tangent \\( \\frac{M}{Sd} \\) of fig. 4.\n\nThere is still an easier method of finding both \\( 2x \\) and \\( 2y \\), as follows.\n\nMake \\( M + S : M - S = \\tan a : \\tan b \\). Then \\( b \\) is the difference of \\( a \\) and \\( y \\), as \\( a \\) is their sum. For this analogy evidently gives the tangent of half the difference of the angles CSM and CMS of fig. 4, or of \\( 2x \\) and \\( 2y \\). Therefore to \\( a \\), which is half the sum of \\( 2x \\) + \\( 2y \\), add \\( b \\), and we have \\( 2x = a + b \\), or \\( x = \\frac{a + b}{2} \\), and \\( y = \\frac{a - b}{2} \\).\n\nBy either of these methods a table may be readily computed of the value of \\( x \\) or \\( y \\) for every value of \\( a \\).\n\nBut we must recollect that the values of \\( S \\) and \\( M \\) are by no means constant, but vary in the inverse triplicate ratio of the earth's distance from the sun and moon; and the ratio of 2 to 5 obtains only when these luminaries are at their mean distances from the earth. The forces corresponding to the perigean, medium, and apogean distances are as follow:\n\n| Sun. | Moon. |\n|------|-------|\n| Apogean | 1.901 | 4.258 |\n| Medium | 2. | 5. |\n| Perigean | 2.105 | 5.925 |\n\nHence we see that the ratio of \\( S \\) to \\( M \\) may vary from 1.901 : 5.925 to 2.105 : 4.258, that is, nearly from 1 : 3 to 1 : 2, or from 2 : 6 to 2 : 4. The solar force does not vary much, and may be retained as constant without any great error. But the change of the moon's force has great effects on the tides both as to their time and their quantity.\n\nI. In respect of their Time.\n\n1. The tide day following a spring tide is 24 h. 27' when the moon is in perigee, but 24 h. 33' when she is in apogee.\n\n2. The tide day following neap tide is 25 h. 15', and 25 h. 40' in the two situations of the moon.\n\n3. The greatest interval of time between high water and the moon's fouthing is 39' and 61'; the angle\nII. In respect of their Heights.\n\n1. If the moon is in perigee when new or full, the spring tide will be 8 feet instead of 7, which corresponds to her mean distance. The very next spring tide happens when she is near her apogee, and will be 6 feet instead of 7. The neap tides happen when she is at her mean distance, and will therefore be 3 feet.\n\nBut if the moon be at her mean distance when new or full, the two succeeding spring tides will be regular or 7 feet, and one of the neap tides will be 4 feet and the other only 2 feet.\n\nMr Bernoulli has given us the following table of the time of high water for these three chief situations of the moon, namely, her perigee, mean distance, and apogee. It may be had by interpolation for all intermediate positions with as great accuracy as can be hoped for in phenomena which are subject to such a complication of disturbances. The first column contains the moon's elongation from the sun. The columns P, M, A, contain the minutes of time which elapse between the moon's fouthing and high water, according as she is in perigee, at her mean distance, or in apogee. The sign \u2014 indicates the priority, and + the posteriority, of high water to the moon's fouthing.\n\n| D | P | M | A |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| 10 | 9\u00bd | 11\u00bd | 14 |\n| 20 | 18 | 22 | 27\u00bd |\n| 30 | 26 | 31\u00bd | 39\u00bd |\n| 40 | 33 | 40 | 50 |\n| 50 | 37\u00bd | 45 | 56 |\n| 60 | 38\u00bd | 46\u00bd | 58 |\n| 70 | 33\u00bd | 40\u00bd | 50\u00bd |\n| 80 | 22 | 25 | 31 |\n| 90 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| 100 | + | + | + |\n| 110 | 21 | 25 | 31 |\n| 120 | 33\u00bd | 40\u00bd | 50\u00bd |\n| 130 | 38\u00bd | 46\u00bd | 58 |\n| 140 | 37\u00bd | 45 | 56 |\n| 150 | 33 | 40 | 50 |\n| 160 | 26 | 31\u00bd | 39\u00bd |\n| 170 | 9\u00bd | 11\u00bd | 14 |\n| 180 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n\nThe reader will undoubtedly be making some comparison in his own mind of the deductions from this theory with the actual state of things. He will find some considerable resemblances; but he will also find such great differences as will make him very doubtful of its justness. In very few places does the high water happen within three-fourths of an hour of the moon's fouthing, as the theory leads him to expect; and in no place whatever does the spring tide fall on the day of new and full moon, nor the neap tide on the day of her quadrature. These always happen two or three days later. By comparing the difference of high water and the moon's fouthing in different places, he will hardly find any connecting principle. This shows evidently that the cause of this irregularity is local, and that the justness of the theory is not affected by it. By considering the phenomena in a navigable river, he will learn the real cause of the deviation. A flood tide arrives at the mouth of a river. The true theoretical tide differs in no respect from a wave. Suppose a spring tide actually formed on a fluid sphere, and the sun and moon then annihilated. The elevation must sink, pressing the under waters aside, and causing them to rise where they were depressed. The motion will not stop when the surface comes to a level; for the waters arrived at that position with a motion continually accelerated. They will therefore pass this position as a pendulum passes the perpendicular, and will rise as far on the other side, forming a high water where it was low water, and a low water where it was high water; and this would go on for ever, oscillating in a time which mathematicians can determine, if it were not for the viscosity, or something like friction, of the waters. If the sphere is not fluid to the centre, the motion of this wave will be different. The elevated waters cannot sink without diffusing themselves sidewise, and occasioning a great horizontal motion, in order to fill up the hollow at the place of low water. This motion will be greatest about half way between the places of high and low water. The shallower we suppose the ocean, the greater must this horizontal motion be. The resistance of the bottom (though perfectly smooth and even) will greatly retard it all the way to the surface. Still, however, it will move till all be level, and will even move a little farther, and produce a small flood and ebb where the ebb and flood had been. Then a contrary motion will obtain; and after a few oscillations, which can be calculated, it will be infensible. If the bottom of the ocean (which we still suppose to cover the whole earth) be uneven, with long extended valleys running in various directions, and with elevations reaching near the surface, it is evident that this must occasion great irregularities in the motion of the undermost waters, both in respect of velocity and direction, and even occasion small inequalities on the surface, as we see in a river with a rugged bottom and rapid current. The deviations of the under currents will drag with them the contiguous incumbent waters, and thus occasion greater superficial irregularities.\n\nNow a flood arriving at the mouth of a river, must act precisely as this great wave does. It must be propagated up the river (or along it, even though perfectly level) in a certain time, and we shall have high water at all the different places in succession. This is distinctly seen in all rivers. It is high water at the mouth of the Thames at three o'clock, and later as we go up the river, till at London bridge we have not high water till three o'clock in the morning, at which time it is again high water at the Nore. But, in the mean time, there has been low water at the Nore, and high water about half way to London; and while the high water is proceeding to London, it is ebbing at this intermediate place, and is low water there when it is high water at London and at the Nore. Did the tide extend as far beyond London as London is from the Nore, we should\nshould have three high waters with two low waters interposed. The most remarkable instance of this kind is the Maragnon or Amazon river in South America. It appears by the observations of Condamine and others, that between Para, at the mouth of the river, and the confluence of the Madera and Maragnon, there are seven coexistent high waters, with six low waters between them. Nothing can more evidently show that the tides in these places are nothing but the propagation of a wave. The velocity of its superficial motion, and the distance to which it will sensibly go, must depend on many circumstances. A deep channel and gentle activity will allow it to proceed much farther up the river, and the distance between the successive summits will be greater than when the channel is shallow and steep. If we apply the ingenious theory of Chevalier Buat, delivered in the article River, we may tell both the velocity of the motion and the interval of the successive high waters. It may be imitated in artificial canals, and experiments of this kind would be very instructive. We have said enough at present for our purpose of explaining the irregularity of the times of high water in different places, with respect to the moon's fouthing. For we now see clearly, that something of the same kind must happen in all great arms of the sea which are of an oblong shape, and communicate by one end with the open ocean. The general tide in this ocean must proceed along this channel, and the high water will happen on its shores in succession. This also is distinctly seen. The tide in the Atlantic ocean produces high water at new and full moon at a later and later hour along the south coast of Great Britain in proportion as we proceed from Scilly islands to Dover. In the same manner it is later and later as we come along the east coast from Orkney to Dover. Yet even in this progress there are considerable irregularities, owing to the sinuosities of the shores, deep indented bays, prominent capes, and extensive ridges and valleys in the channel. A similar progress is observed along the coasts of Spain and France, the tide advancing gradually from the south, turning round Cape Finisterre, ranging along the north coast of Spain, and along the west and north coasts of France.\n\nThe attentive consideration of these facts will not only satisfy us with respect to this difficulty, but will enable us to trace a principle of connection amidst all the irregularities that we observe.\n\nWe now add, that if we note the difference between the time of high water of spring tide, as given by theory, for any place, and the observed time of high water, we shall find this interval to be very nearly constant through the whole series of tides during a lunation. Suppose this interval to be 40 hours. We shall find every other phenomenon succeed after the same interval. And if we suppose the moon to be in the place where she was 40 hours before, the observation will agree pretty well with the theory, as to the succession of tides, the length of tide day, the retardations of the tides, and their gradual diminution from spring to neap tide. We say pretty well; for there still remain several small irregularities, different in different places, and not following any observable law. These are therefore local, and owing to local causes. Some of these we shall afterwards point out. There is also a general deviation of the theory from the real series of tides. The neap tides, and those adjoining, happen a little earlier than the corrected theory points out. Thus at Bret (where more numerous and accurate observations have been made than at any other place in Europe), when the moon changes precisely at noon, it is high water at 3 h. 28'. When the moon enters her second quarter at noon, it is high water at 8 h. 40', instead of 9 h. 48', which theory assigns.\n\nSomething similar, and within a very few minutes equal, to this is observed in every place on the sea-coast. This is therefore something general, and indicates a real defect in the theory.\n\nBut this arises from the same cause with the other general deviation, viz., that the greatest and least tides do not happen on the days of full and half moon, but a certain time after. We shall attempt to explain this.\n\nWe set out with the supposition, that the water acquired in an instant the elevation competent to its equilibrium. But this is not true. No motion is instantaneous, however great the force; and every motion and change of motion produced by a sensible or finite force increases from nothing to a sensible quantity by infinitely small degrees. Time elapses before the body can acquire any sensible velocity; and in order to acquire the same sensible velocity by the action of different forces acting similarly, a time must elapse inversely proportional to the force. An infinitely small force requires a finite time for communicating even an infinitely small velocity; and a finite force, in an infinitely small time, communicates only an infinitely small velocity; and if there be any kind of motion which changes by insensible degrees, it requires a finite force to prevent this change. Thus a bucket of water, hanging by a cord lapped round a light and easily moveable cylinder, will run down with a motion uniformly accelerated; but this motion will be prevented by hanging an equal bucket on the other side, so as to act with a finite force. This force prevents only infinitely small accelerations.\n\nNow let ALKF (fig. 6.) be the solid nucleus of the earth, surrounded by the spherical ocean b h d g. Let this be raised to a spheroid BHDG by the action of the moon at M, or in the direction of the axis CM. If all be at rest, this spheroid may have the form precisely competent to its equilibrium. But let the nucleus, with its spheroidal ocean, have a motion round C in the direction AFKL from west to east. When the line of water BA is carried into the situation s q infinitely near to BA, it is no longer in equilibrium; for s is too elevated, and the part now come to B is too much depressed. There is a force tending to depress the waters at r, and to raise those now at B; but this force is infinitely small. It cannot therefore restore the shape competent to equilibrium till a sensible time has elapsed; therefore the disturbing force of the moon cannot keep the summit of the ocean in the line MC. The force must be of a certain determinate magnitude before it can in an instant undo the instantaneous effect of the rotation of the waters and keep the summit of the ocean in the same place. But this effect is possible; for the depression at s necessary for this purpose is nearly as the distance from B, being a depression, not from a straight line, but from a circle described with the radius CB. It is therefore an infinitesimal of the first order, and may be restored in an instant, or the continuation of the depression.\npression prevented by a certain finite force. Therefore there is some distance, such as B y, where the disturbing force of the moon may have the necessary intensity. Therefore the spherical ocean, instead of being kept continually accumulated at B and D, as the waters turn round, will be kept accumulated at y and y', but at a height somewhat smaller. It is much in this way that we keep melted pitch or other clammy matter from running off from a brush, by continually turning it round, and it hangs protuberant, not from the lowest point, but from a point beyond it, in the direction of its motion. The facts are very similar. The following experiment will illustrate this completely, and is quite a parallel fact. Conceive G D H, the lower half of the ellipse, to be a supple heavy rope or chain hanging from a roller with a handle. The weight of the rope makes it hang in an oblong curve, just as the force of the moon raises the waters of the ocean. Turn the roller very slowly, and the rope, unwinding at one side and winding up on the other side of the roller, will continue to form the same curve: but turn the roller very briskly in the direction F K L, and the rope will now hang like the curve u y v, considerably advanced from the perpendicular, so far, to wit, that the force of gravity may be able in an instant to undo the infinitely small elevation produced by the turning.\n\nWe are very anxious to have this circumstance clearly conceived, and its truth firmly established; because we have observed it to puzzle many persons not accustomed to such difficulties: we therefore hope that our readers, who have got over the difficulty, will indulge us while we give yet another view of this matter, which leads to the same conclusion.\n\nIt is certain that the interval between high and low water is not sufficient for producing all the accumulation necessary for equilibrium in an ocean so very shallow. The horizontal motion necessary for gathering together so much water along a shallow sea would be prodigious. Therefore it never attains its full height; and when the waters, already raised to a certain degree, have passed the situation immediately under the moon, they are still under the action of accumulating forces, although these forces are now diminished. They will continue rising, till they have so far past the moon, that their situation subjects them to depressing forces. If they have acquired this situation with an accelerated motion, they will rise still farther by their inherent motion, till the depressing forces have destroyed all their acceleration, and then they will begin to sink again. It is in this way that the nutation of the earth's axis produces the greatest inclination, not when the inclining forces are greatest, but three months after. It is thus that the warmest time of the day is a considerable while after noon, and that the warmest season is considerably after midsummer. The warmth increases till the momentary waste of heat exceeds the momentary supply. We conclude by saying, that it may be demonstrated, that, in a sphere fluid to the centre, the time of high water cannot be less, and may be more, than three lunar hours after the moon's southing. As the depth of the ocean diminishes, this interval also diminishes.\n\nIt is perhaps impossible to assign the distance B y at which the summit of the ocean may be kept while the earth turns round its axis. We can only see, that it must be less when the accumulating force is greater, and therefore less in spring tides than in neap tides; but the difference may be inconsiderable. All this depends on circumstances which we are little acquainted with: many of these circumstances are local; and the situation of the summit of the ocean, with respect to the moon, may be different in different places.\n\nNor have we been able to determine theoretically what will be the height of the summit. It will certainly be less than the height necessary for perfect equilibrium. Daniel Bernoulli says, that, after very attentive consideration, he is convinced that the height at new or full moon will be to the theoretical height as the cosine of the angle BC y to radius, or that the height at y will be\n\n\\[ \\frac{C}{Bb} \\times \\frac{C}{b}. \\]\n\nThe result of all this reasoning is, that we must always suppose the summit of the tide is at a certain distance eastward from the place assigned by the theory. Mr Bernoulli concludes, from a very copious comparison of observations at different places, that the place of high water is about 20 degrees to the eastward of the place assigned by the theory. Therefore the table formerly given will correspond with observation, if the leading column of the moon's elongation from the sun be altered accordingly. We have inserted it again in this place, with this alteration, and added three columns for the times of high water. Thus changed it will be of great use.\n\nWe have now an explanation of the acceleration of the neap tides, which should happen 6 hours later than the spring tides. They are in fact tides corresponding to positions of the moon, which are 25\u00b0 more, and not the real spring and neap tides. These do not happen till two days after; and if the really greatest and least tides be observed, the least will be found 6 hours later than the first.\n\n| Elong. of Moon | High Water before or after Moon's Southing | Time of High Water |\n|---------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n|               | Perigee | M.

If therefore the time of high water in any place on the earth's equator (for we have hitherto considered no other) be different from this table (supposed correct), we must attribute the difference to the distinguishing circumstances of the situation. Thus every place on the equator should have high water on the day that the moon, situated at her mean distance, changes precisely at noon, at 22 minutes past noon; because the moon passes the meridian along with the sun by supposition. Therefore, to make use of this table, we must take the difference between the first number of the column, intitled time of high water, from the time of high water at full and change peculiar to any place, and add this to all the numbers of that column. This adapts the table to the given place. Thus, to know the time of high water at Leith, when the moon is 5\u00b0 east of the sun, at her mean distance from the earth, take 22' from 4h. 30', there remains 4.08'. Add this to 2h. 48' and we have 6\u00b0 56' for the hour of high water. The hour of high water at new and full moon for Edinburgh is marked 4h. 30' in Mafekynne's tables, but we do not pretend to give it as the exact determination. This would require a series of accurate observations.\n\nIt is by no means an easy matter to ascertain the time of high water with precision. It changes so very slowly, that we may easily mistake the exact minute. The best method is to have a pipe with a small hole near its bottom, and a float with a long graduated rod. The water gets in by the small hole, and raises the float, and the smallness of the hole prevents the sudden and irregular starts which waves would occasion. Instead of observing the moment of high water, observe the height of the rod about half an hour before, and wait after high water till the rod comes again to that height. Take the middle between them. The water rises sensibly half an hour before the top of the tide, and quickly changes the height of the rod, so that we cannot make a great mistake in the time.\n\nMr Bernoulli has made a very careful comparison of the theory thus corrected, with the great collection of observations preserved in the Depot de la Marine at Brest and Rochefort, and finds the coincidence very great, and far exceeding any rule which he had ever seen. Indeed we have no rules but what are purely empirical, or which suppose a uniform progression of the tides.\n\nThe heights of the tides are much more affected by local circumstances than the regular series of their times. The regular spring tide should be to the neap tide in the same proportion in all places; but nothing is more different than this proportion. In some places the spring tide is not double of the neap tide, and in other places it is more than quadruple. This prevented Bernoulli from attempting to fix the proportion of M to S by means of the heights of the tides. Newton had, however, done it by the tides at Bristol, and made the lunar force almost five times greater than the solar force. But this was very ill-founded, for the reason now given.\n\nYet Bernoulli saw, that in all places the tides gradually decreased from the syzygies to the quadratures. He therefore presumed, that they decreased by a similar law with the theoretical tides, and has given a very ingenious method of accommodating the theory to any tides which may be observed. Let A be the spring tide, and B the neap tide in any place. Then form an M and an S from these, by making \\( M = \\frac{A+B}{2} \\), and \\( S = \\frac{A-B}{2} \\); so that \\( M + S \\) may be = \u039b, and \\( M - S = B \\) agreeable to the theory. Then with this M and S compose the general tide T, agreeable to the construction of the problem. We may be persuaded that the result cannot be far from the truth. The following table is calculated for the three chief distances of the moon from the earth.\n\n| Elong. | Height of the Tide |\n|--------|-------------------|\n|        | Moon in Perigee.  | Moon in M.

Thus when the moon is 20 degrees from the sun, the mean distance tide is 1.00A + 0.00B, which is the theoretical tide corresponding to conjunction or opposition.\n\nWe have now given in sufficient detail the phenomena of the tides along the equator, when the sun and moon are both in the equator, shewing both their times and their magnitude. When we recollect that all the sections of an oblong spheroid by a plane passing through an equatorial diameter are ellipses, and that the compound tide is a combination of two such spheroids, we perceive that every section of it through the centre, and perpendicular to the plane in which the sun and moon are situated, is also an ellipse, whose shorter axis is the equatorial diameter of a spring tide. This is the greatest depression in all situations of the luminaries; and the points of greatest depression are the lower poles of every compound tide. When the luminaries are in the equator, these lower poles coincide with the poles of the earth. The equator, therefore, of every compound tide is also an ellipse: the whole circumference of which is lower than any other section of this tide, and gives the place of low water in every part of the earth. In like manner, the section through the four poles, upper and lower, gives the place of high water. These two sections are terrestrial meridians or hour circles, when the luminaries are in the equator.\n\nHence\nHence it follows, that all we have already said as to the times of high and low water may be applied to every place on the surface of the earth, when the sun and moon are in the equator. But the heights of tide will diminish as we recede from the equator. The heights must be reduced in the proportion of radius to the cosine of the latitude of the place. But in every other situation of the sun and moon all the circumstances vary exceedingly. It is very true, that the determination of the elevation of the waters in any place whatever is equally easy. The difficulty is, to exhibit for that place a connected view of the whole tide, with the hours of flood and ebb, and the difference between high and low water. This is not indeed difficult; but the process by the ordinary rules of spherical trigonometry is tedious. When the sun and moon are not near conjunction or opposition, the shape of the ocean resembles a turnip, which is flat and not round in its broadest part. Before we can determine with precision the different phenomena in connection, we must ascertain the position or attitude of this turnip; marking on the surface of the earth both its elliptical equators. One of these is the plane passing through the sun and moon, and the other is perpendicular to it, and marks the place of low water. And we must mark in like manner its first meridian, which passes through all the four poles, and marks on the surface of the earth the place of high water. The position of the greatest section of this compound spheroid is frequently much inclined to the earth's equator; nay sometimes it is at right angles to it, when the moon has the same right ascension with the sun, but a different declination. In these cases the ebb tide on the equator is the greatest possible; for the lower poles of the compound spheroid are in the equator. Such situations occasion a very complicated calculus. We must therefore content ourselves with a good approximation.\n\nAnd first, with respect to the times of high water. It will be sufficient to conceive the sun and moon as always in one plane, viz. the ecliptic. The orbits of the sun and moon are never more inclined than $5^\\circ$ degrees. This will make very little difference; for when the luminaries are so situated that the great circle through them is much inclined to the equator, they are then very near to each other, and the form of the spheroid is little different from what it would be if they were really in conjunction or opposition. It will therefore be sufficient to consider the moon in three different situations.\n\n1. In the equator. The point of highest water is never farther from the moon than $15^\\circ$, when she is in apogee, and the sun in perigee. Therefore if a meridian be drawn through the point of highest water to the equator, the arch $mh$ of fig. 4. will be represented on the equator by another arch about $\\frac{9}{2}$\u00b0 by reason of the inclination of the equator and ecliptic. Therefore, to have the time of high water, multiply the numbers of the columns which express the difference of high water and the moon's fouthing by $\\frac{9}{2}$\u00b0, and the products give the real difference.\n\n2. Let the moon be in her greatest declination. The arch of right ascension corresponding to $mh$ will be had by multiplying $mh$, or the time corresponding to it in the table, by $\\frac{9}{2}$\u00b0.\n\n3. When the moon is in a middle situation between these two extremes, the numbers of the table will give the right ascension corresponding to $mh$ without any correction, the distance from the equator compensating for the obliquity of the ecliptic arch $mh$.\n\nThe time of low water is not so easily found; and we must either go through the whole trigonometrical process, or content ourselves with a less perfect approximation. The trigonometrical process is not indeed difficult: we must find the position of the plane through the sun and moon. A great circle through the moon perpendicular to this is the line of high water; and another perpendicular circle cutting this at right angles is the circle of low water.\n\nBut it will be abundantly exact to consider the tide as accompanying the moon only.\n\nLet $NOS$ (fig. 7.) be a section of the terraqueous globe, of which $N$ and $S$ are the north and south poles and $EOQ$ the equator. Let the moon be in the direction $OM$, having the declination $BQ$. Let $D$ be any place on the earth's surface. Draw the parallel $LDC$ of latitude. Let $B'F'b'f'$ be the ocean, formed into a spheroid, of which $Bb$ is the axis and $f'F'$ the equator.\n\nAs the place $D$ is carried along the parallel $CDL$ by the rotation of the earth, it will pass in succession through different depths of the watery spheroid. It will have high water when at $C$ and $L$, and low water when it crosses the circle $f'OF'$. Draw the meridian $N'dG$, and the great circle $Bdb$. The arch $GQ$, when converted into lunar hours (each about 62 minutes), gives the duration of the flood $dc$ and of the subsequent ebb $cd$, which happen while the moon is above the horizon; and the arch $EG$ will give the durations of the flood and of the ebb which happen when the moon is below the horizon. It is evident, that these two floods and two ebbs have unequal durations. When $D$ is at $C$ it has high water, and the height of the tide is $CC'$. For, the spheroid is supposed to touch the sphere on the equator $f'OF'$, so that $CC'$ is the difference between high and low water. At $L$ the height of the tide is $LL'$; and if we describe the circle $LNq$, $Cq$ is the difference of these high waters, or of these tides.\n\nHence it appears, that the two tides of one lunar day may be considerably different, and it is proper to distinguish them by different names. We shall call that a superior tide which happens when the moon is above the horizon during high water. The other may be called the inferior tide. The duration of the superior tide is measured by $2GQ$, and that of the inferior tide by $2EG$; and $4GO$ measures the difference between the whole duration of a superior and of an inferior tide.\n\nFrom this construction we may learn in general,\n\n1. When the moon has no declination, the durations and also the heights of the superior and inferior tides are equal in all parts of the world. For in this case the tide equator $f'F'$ coincides with the meridian $NOS$, and the poles $B'b'$ of the watery spheroid are on the earth's equator.\n\n2. When the moon has declination, the duration and also the height of a superior tide at any place is greater than that of the inferior; or is less than it, according as the moon's declination and the latitude of the place are of the same or opposite names.\n\nThis is an important circumstance. It frequently happens that the inferior tide is found the greatest when it should be the least; which is particularly the case at the Nore. This shows, without further reasoning, that the tide at the Nore is only a branch of the regular tide.\nThe regular tide comes in between Scotland and the continent; and after travelling along the coast reaches the Thames, while the regular tide is just coming in again between Scotland and the continent.\n\n3. If the moon's declination is equal to the colatitude of the place, or exceeds it, there will be only one tide in a lunar day. It will be a superior or an inferior tide, according as the declination of the moon and the latitude of the place are of the same or opposite kinds.\n\nFor the equator of the tide cuts the meridian in \\( f \\) and \\( k \\). Therefore a place which moves in the parallel \\( c \\) has high water when at \\( e \\), and 12 lunar hours afterwards has low water when at \\( j \\). And any place \\( k \\) which is still nearer to the pole \\( N \\) has high water when at \\( k \\), and 12 lunar hours afterwards has low water at \\( m \\). Therefore, as the moon's declination extends to \\( 30^\\circ \\), all places farther north or south than the latitude \\( 60^\\circ \\) will sometimes have only one tide in a lunar day.\n\n4. The sine of the arch \\( GO \\), which measures \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)th of the difference between the duration of a superior and inferior tide, is \\( = \\tan \\text{ lat. } \\times \\tan \\text{ decl. } \\). For in the spherical triangle \\( dOG \\)\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rad. : cotan. } dOG = \\tan. dG : \\sin. GO, \\quad \\text{and} \\\\\n\\sin. GO = \\tan. dOQ \\times \\tan. dG, = \\tan. decl. \\times \\tan. lat.\n\\]\n\nHence we see, that the difference of the durations of the superior and inferior tides of the same day increase both with the moon's declination and with the latitude of the place.\n\nThe different situations of the moon and of the place of observation affect the heights of the tides no less remarkably. When the point \\( D \\) comes under the meridian \\( NBQ \\), in which the moon is situated, there is a superior high water, and the height of the tide above the low water of that day is \\( CC' \\). When \\( D \\) is at \\( L \\), the height of the inferior tide is \\( LL' \\). The elevation above the inscribed sphere is \\( M \\times \\cos. y \\), \\( y \\) being the zenith distance of the moon at the place of observation. Therefore at high water, which by the theory is in the place directly under the moon, the height of the tide is as the square of the cosine of the moon's zenith or nadir distance.\n\nHence we derive a construction which solves all questions relation to the height of the tides with great facility, free from all the intricacy and ambiguities of the algebraic analysis employed by Bernoulli.\n\nWith the radius \\( CQ = M \\) (the elevation produced by the moon above the inscribed sphere) describe the circle \\( PPE \\) (fig. 8.) to represent a meridian, of which \\( P \\) and \\( P \\) are the poles, and \\( EQ \\) the equator. Bisect \\( CP \\) in \\( O \\); and round \\( O \\) describe the circle \\( PBOD \\). Let \\( M \\) be the place over which the moon is vertical, and \\( Z \\) be the place of observation. \\( MQ \\) is the moon's declination, and \\( ZQ \\) is the latitude of the place. Draw \\( MCm, ZCN \\), cutting the small circle in \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). Draw \\( AG \\perp CP \\), and draw \\( CIu \\), which will cut off an arch \\( E = QM \\). \\( MZ \\) and \\( uN \\) are the moon's zenith and nadir distances. Draw the diameter \\( BD \\), and the perpendiculars \\( IK, GH, \\) and \\( AF \\). Also draw \\( OA, PA, AB, ID \\).\n\nThen \\( DF \\) is the superior tide, \\( DK \\) is the inferior tide, and \\( IH \\) is the arithmetical mean tide.\n\nFor the angles \\( BCA, PDA \\), standing on \\( BA \\), are equal. Also the angles \\( IDB, uCN \\), are equal, being supplements of the angle \\( ICB \\). Therefore, if \\( BD \\) be made radius, \\( DA \\) and \\( DI \\) are the fines of the zenith and nadir distances of the moon.\n\nBut \\( BD : DA = DA : DF \\). Therefore \\( DF = M \\times \\cos. y \\), \\( = \\) the height \\( Z \\) of the superior tide. Also \\( DK = M \\cdot \\cos. y', = \\) the height \\( n \\) of the inferior tide.\n\nAlso, because \\( IA \\) is bisected in \\( G \\), \\( KF \\) is bisected in \\( H \\), and \\( DH = \\frac{DK + DF}{2} \\), \\( = \\) the medium tide.\n\nLet us trace the relation of the consequences of the various positions of \\( Z \\) and \\( M \\), as we formerly considered the results of the various situations of the sun and moon.\n\nFirst, then, let \\( Z \\) retain its place, and let \\( M \\) gradually approach it from the equator. When \\( M \\) is in the equator, \\( A \\) and \\( I \\) coincide with \\( C \\), and the three points \\( F, K, \\) and \\( H, \\) coincide in \\( z \\).\n\nAs \\( M \\) approaches to \\( Z, A \\) and \\( I \\) approach to \\( B \\) and \\( D \\); \\( DF \\) increases, and \\( DK \\) diminishes. The superior or inferior tide is greatest when the moon is in \\( M \\) or in \\( N \\); and \\( DF \\) is then \\( = M \\). As the moon passes to the northward of the place, the superior and inferior tides both diminish till \\( I \\) comes to \\( D \\); at which time \\( MQ \\) is equal to \\( ZP \\), and there is no inferior tide. This however cannot happen if \\( ZP \\) is greater than \\( 30^\\circ \\), because the moon never goes farther from the equator. \\( M \\) still going north, we have again a perpendicular from \\( I \\) on \\( BD \\), but below \\( I \\), indicating that the inferior tide, now measured by \\( DK \\), belongs to the hemispheroid next the moon. Also, as \\( M \\) advances from the equator northward, \\( DK \\) diminishes continually. First, while \\( H \\) lies between \\( O \\) and \\( B \\), because \\( G \\) approaches \\( O \\); and afterwards, when \\( G \\) is above \\( O \\) and \\( H \\) lies between \\( O \\) and \\( D \\). It is otherwise, however, if \\( ZQ \\) is greater than \\( 45^\\circ \\); for then \\( DB \\) is inclined to \\( EQ \\) the other way, and \\( DH \\) increases as the point \\( G \\) rises.\n\nIn the next place, let \\( M \\) retain its position, and \\( Z \\) proceed along the meridian.\n\nLet us begin at the equator, or suppose \\( Q \\) the place of observation. \\( BD \\) then coincides with \\( CP \\), and the three lines \\( DF, DK, \\) and \\( DH, \\) all coincide with \\( PG \\), denoting the two equal tides \\( Qq \\) and \\( Ee \\) and their medium, equal to either. As \\( Z \\) goes northward from \\( Q \\), \\( EOD \\) detaches itself from \\( COP \\); the line \\( DF \\) increases, while \\( DK \\) and \\( DH \\) diminish. When \\( Z \\) comes to \\( M, F \\) and \\( B \\) coincide with \\( A, \\) and \\( DK \\) and \\( DH \\) are still more diminished. When \\( Z \\) passes \\( M, \\) all the three lines \\( DF, DK, \\) and \\( DH, \\) continue to diminish. When \\( Z \\) comes to latitudes \\( 45^\\circ, DB \\) is parallel to \\( IA \\) and \\( EQ, \\) and the point \\( H \\) coincides with \\( O \\). This situation of \\( Z \\) has the peculiar property that \\( DH \\) (now \\( DO \\)) is the same, whatever be the declination of the moon. For \\( IA \\) being always parallel to \\( DB, OK \\) and \\( OF \\) will be equal, and \\( DO \\) will be half of \\( DK \\) and \\( DF, \\) however they may vary. When \\( Z \\) gets so far north that \\( ZP = MQ, \\) the diameter \\( b \\) falls on \\( I; \\) so that \\( d \\) vanishes, and we have only \\( df \\). And when \\( Z \\) goes still farther north, \\( db \\) appears on the other side of \\( I. \\) When \\( Z \\) arrives at the pole, \\( BD \\) again coincides with \\( PC, D \\) with \\( C, \\) and \\( DF, DK, \\) and \\( DH, \\) coincide with \\( CG. \\)\n\nThese variations of the points \\( F, K, \\) and \\( H, \\) indicate the following phenomena.\nThe greatest tides happen when the moon is in the zenith or nadir of the place of observation; for then the point B coincides with A, and DF becomes DB; that is, \\(=M\\), indicating the full tide BB'.\n\n2. When the moon is in the equator, the superior and inferior tides have equal heights, \\(=M \\cdot \\text{cof.}^2 \\text{lat}\\). For then A and I coincide with C, and the points F and K coincide in i, and Di is \\(=DB \\cdot \\text{cof.}^2 \\text{BDC}, =M \\cdot \\text{cof.}^2 \\text{lat}\\).\n\n3. If the place of observation is in the equator, the inferior and superior tides are again equal, whatever is the moon's declination: For then B coincides with C, and the points F, K, and H, coincide with G; and PG \\(=PC \\cdot \\text{cof.}^2 \\text{APG}, =M \\cdot \\text{cof.}^2 \\text{decl. moon}\\).\n\n4. The superior tides are greater or less than the inferior tides according as the latitude and declination are of the same or of opposite names. For by making \\(QZ = ZQ\\), and drawing \\(Cn\\), cutting the small circle in \\(P\\), we see that the figure is reversed. The difference between the superior and inferior tides is \\(KF\\), or \\(IA \\times \\text{cof. of the angle formed by IA and DB};\\) that is, of the angle BD, which is the complement of twice \\(ZQ\\); because \\(BOC = 2ZCO\\). Now \\(IA = 2GA\\), \\(=2OA \\cdot \\text{fin.} \\cdot 2MQ = PC \\cdot \\text{fin.} \\cdot 2MQ, =M \\cdot \\text{fin.} \\cdot 2 \\text{decl.}\\). Therefore the difference of the superior and inferior tides is \\(M \\cdot \\text{fin.} \\cdot 2 \\text{declin. fin.} \\cdot 2 \\text{lat}\\).\n\n5. If the colatitude be equal to the declination, or less than it, there will be no inferior tide, or no superior tide, according as the latitude of the place and declination of the moon are of the same or opposite names.\n\nFor when \\(PZ = MQ\\), D coincides with I, and IK vanishes. When \\(PZ\\) is less than \\(MQ\\), the point D is between C and I, and the point Z never passes through the equator of the watery spheroid; and the low water of its only tide is really the summit of the inferior tide.\n\n6. At the pole there is no daily tide: but there are two monthly tides \\(=M \\cdot \\text{fin.}^2 \\text{declin.}\\) and it is low water when the moon is in the equator.\n\n7. The medium tide, represented by DH, is \\(=M \\times \\frac{1+\\text{cof.}^2 \\text{lat.}}{\\text{cof.}^2 \\text{declin.}}\\). For \\(DH = DO + OH\\).\n\nNow \\(OG\\) is equal to \\(OG \\times \\text{cof.} \\cdot GOH = OG \\cdot \\text{cof.}^2 ZQ\\). And \\(OG = OA \\cdot \\text{cof.} \\cdot GOA = OA \\cdot \\text{cof.}^2 MQ\\). Therefore \\(DH = OH = OA \\cdot \\text{cof.}^2 ZQ \\cdot \\text{cof.}^2 MQ = M \\cdot \\frac{1+\\text{cof.}^2 ZQ}{\\text{cof.}^2 MQ}\\). Let this for the future be called \\(m\\).\n\nN.B. The moon's declination never exceeds \\(35^\\circ\\). Therefore \\(\\text{cof.}^2 MQ\\) is always a positive quantity, and never less than \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\), which is the cosine of \\(65^\\circ\\). While the latitude is less than \\(45^\\circ\\), \\(\\text{cof.}^2 \\text{lat.}\\) is also a positive quantity. When it is precisely \\(45^\\circ\\) the cosine of its double is \\(0\\); and when it is greater than \\(45^\\circ\\), the cosine of its double is negative. Hence we see,\n\n1. That the medium tides are equally affected by the northern and southern declinations of the moon.\n\n2. If the latitude of the place is \\(45^\\circ\\), the medium tide is always \\(\\frac{1}{2} M\\). This is the reason why the tides along the coasts of France and Spain are so little affected by the declination of the moon.\n\n3. If the latitude is less than \\(45^\\circ\\), the mean tides increase as the moon's declination diminishes. The contrary happens if \\(ZQ\\) is greater than \\(45^\\circ\\). For \\(DH\\) increases or diminishes while the point G separates from C according as the angle COD is greater or less than COB; that is, according as PCZ is greater or less than ZCO.\n\n4. When Z is in the equator, H coincides with G, and the effect of the moon's declination on the height of the tides is the most sensible. The mean tide is then \\(=M \\cdot \\frac{1+\\text{cof.}^2 MQ}{2}\\).\n\nAll that we have now said may be said of the solar tide, putting S in place of M.\n\nAlso the same things hold true of spring tides putting \\(M+S\\) in place of M.\n\nBut in order to ascertain the effects of declination and latitude on other tides, we must make a much more complicated construction, even though we suppose both luminaries in the ecliptic. For in this case the two depressed poles of the watery spheroid are not in the poles of the earth; and therefore the sections of the ocean, made by meridians, are by no means ellipses.\n\nIn a neap tide, the moon is vertical at B (fig. 7 or 8.), fig. 7 or 8., and the sun at some point of \\(fF, 90^\\circ\\) from B. If O be this point, the construction for the heights of the tides may be made by adding to both the superior and inferior tides for any point D, the quantity \\(M+S - DF\\) or \\(DK \\times \\text{fin.}^2 dO, = M+S - \\text{tide} \\times \\text{fin.}^2 \\frac{2Q}{\\text{cof.}^2 MQ}\\), as is evident.\n\nBut if the sun be vertical at d, \\(d'\\) will be the highest part of the circle \\(fOF\\), and no correction is necessary. But in this case the circle of high water will be inclined to the meridian in an angle equal to \\(d'BO\\) (fig. 7), and neither the times nor elevations of high water will be properly ascertained, and the error in time may be considerable in high latitudes.\n\nThe inaccuracies are not so great in intermediate tides, and respect chiefly the time of high water and the height of low water.\n\nThe exact computation is very tedious and peculiar, so that it is hardly possible to give any account of a regular progress of phenomena; and all we can do is, to ascertain the precise heights of detached points. For which reasons, we must content ourselves with the construction already given. It is the exact geometrical expression of Bernoulli's analysis, and its consequences now related contain all that he has investigated. We may accommodate it very nearly to the real state of things, by supposing PC equal, not to CO of fig. 4, but to MS, exhibiting the whole compound tide. And the point B, instead of representing the moon's place, must represent the place of high water.\n\nThus have we obtained a general, though not very accurate, view of the phenomena which must take place in different latitudes and in different declinations of the sun and moon, provided that the physical theory which determines the form and position of the watery spheroid be just. We have only to compute, by a very simple process of spherical trigonometry, the place of the pole of this spheroid. The second construction, in fig. 8, shows us all the circumstances of the time and height of high water at any point. It will be recollected, that in computing this place of the pole, the anticipation of 20 degrees, arising from the inertia of the waters, must be attended to.\nWere we to institute a comparison of this theory with observation, without farther consideration, we should still find it unfavourable, partly in respect of the heights of the tides, and more remarkably in respect of the time of low water. We must again consider the effects of the inertia of the waters, and recollect, that a regular theoretical tide differs very little in its progress from the motion of a wave. Even along the free ocean, its motion much resembles that of any other wave. All waves are propagated by an oscillatory motion of the waters, precisely similar to that of a pendulum. It is well known, that if a pendulum receive a small impulse in the time of every descent, its vibrations may be increased to infinity. Did the successive actions of the sun or moon just keep time with the natural propagation of the tides, or the natural oscillations of the waters, the tides would also augment to infinity: But there is an infinite odds against this exact adjustment. It is much more probable that the action of to-day interrupts or checks the oscillation produced by yesterday's action, and that the motion which we perceive in this day's tide is what remains, and is compounded with the action of to-day. This being the case, we should expect that the nature of any tide will depend much on the nature of the preceding tide. Therefore we should expect that the superior and inferior tides of the same day will be more nearly equal than the theory determines. The whole course of observation confirms this. In latitude 45\u00b0, the superior and inferior tides of one day may differ in the proportion of 2\u00bd to 1, and the tides corresponding to the greatest and least declinations of the moon may differ nearly as much. But the difference of the superior and inferior tides, as they occur in the list of Observations at Rochefort, is not the third part of this, and the changes made by the moon's declination is not above one-half. Therefore we shall come much nearer the true measure of a spring tide, by taking the arithmetical mean, than by taking either the superior or inferior.\n\nWe should expect less deviation from the theory in the gradual diminution of the tides from spring tide to neap tide, and in the gradual changes of the medium tide by the declination of the moon; because the successive changes are very small; and when they change in kind, that is, diminish after having for some time augmented, the change is by insensible degrees. This is most accurately confirmed by observation. The vast collection made by Cassini of the Observations at Brest being examined by Bernoulli, and the medium of the two tides in one day being taken for the tide of that day, he found such an agreement between the progression of these medium tides and the progression of the lines MS of fig. 4, that the one seemed to be calculated by the other. He found no less agreement in the changes of the medium tides by the moon's declination.\n\nIn like manner, the changes produced by the different distances of the moon from the earth, were found abundantly conformable to the theory, although not so exact as the other. This difference or inferiority is easily accounted for: When the moon changes in her mean distance, one of the neap tides is uncommonly small, and therefore the successive diminutions are very great, and one tide sensibly affects another. The same circumstance operates when the changes in apogee, by reason of a very large spring tide. And the changes corresponding both to the sun's distance from the earth and his declination agreed almost exactly.\n\nAll these things considered together, we have abundant reason to conclude, that not only the theory itself is just in principle (a thing which no intelligent naturalist can doubt), but also that the data which are assumed in the application are properly chosen; that is, that the proportion of two to five is very nearly the true proportion of the mean solar and lunar forces. If we now compute the medium tide for any place in succession, from spring tide to neap tide, and still more, if we compute the series of times of their occurrence, we shall find as great an agreement as can be desired. Not but that there are many irregularities; but these are evidently so anomalous, that we can ascribe them to nothing but circumstances which are purely local.\n\nThis general rule of computation must be formed in the following manner:\n\nThe spring tide, according to theory, being called A, and the neap tide B, recollect that the spring tide, according to the regular theory, is measured by M+S. Recollect also, that when the lunar tide only is considered the superior spring tide is M\u00d7sin\u00b2, ZM (fig. 8.). But when we consider the action of two adjoining tides on each other, we find it safer to take the medium of the superior and inferior tides for the measure; and this is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{ZQ \\times \\text{cof. } 2 MQ}{\\text{cof. } 2} \\). Let this be called m. This being totally the effect of M as modified by latitude and declination, may be taken as its proper measure, by which we are to calculate the other tides of the monthly series from spring tide to neap tide.\n\nIn like manner, we must compute a value for S, as modified by declination and latitude; call this s. Then say,\n\n\\[ M+S : A = m+s : A \\times \\frac{m+s}{M+S}. \\]\n\nThis fourth proportional will give the spring tide as modified for the given declination of the luminaries, and the latitude of the place.\n\nNow recollect, that the medium tide, when the luminaries are in the equator, is A\u00d7cof.\u00b2 lat. Therefore let F be the spring tide observed at any place when the luminaries are in the equator; and let this be the medium of a great many observations made in these circumstances. This gives A\u00d7cof.\u00b2 lat. (as modified by the peculiar circumstances of the place) = F. Therefore the fourth proportional now given changes to \\( \\frac{m+s}{M+S} \\times \\frac{\\text{cof. } 2}{\\text{cof. } 2 \\text{ lat.}} \\).\n\nAnd a similar substitute for B is G\n\n\\[ \\frac{m-s}{M-S} \\times \\frac{\\text{cof. } 2}{\\text{cof. } 2 \\text{ lat.}}. \\]\n\nLastly, To accommodate our formulae to every distance of the earth from the sun and moon, let D and \u0394 be the mean distances of the sun and moon, and d and \u03b4 their distances at the given time; and then the two substitutes become\n\n\\[ \\frac{d^3}{d^3} \\times \\frac{D^3}{D^3} \\times \\frac{S}{S} \\times \\frac{F}{(M+S) \\text{cof. } 2 \\text{ lat.}} \\times \\frac{m+s}{M+S} \\times \\frac{\\text{cof. } 2}{\\text{cof. } 2 \\text{ lat.}}. \\]\nThe half sum of these two quantities will be the MC, and their half difference will be the SC, of fig. 4, with which we may now operate, in order to find the tide for any other day of the menstrual series, by means of the elongation \\(a\\) of the moon from the sun; that is, we must say \\(MC + CS = MC - CS = \\tan a : \\tan b\\); then \\(x = \\frac{a + b}{2}\\), and \\(y = \\frac{a - b}{2}\\). And MS, the height of the tide, is \\(MC \\times \\cos 2y + CS \\times \\cos 2x\\).\n\nSuch is the general theory of the tides, deduced from the principle of universal gravitation, and adjusted to that proportion of the solar and lunar forces which is most consistent with other celestial phenomena. The comparison of the greatest and least daily retardations of the tides was with great judgment preferred to the proportion of spring and neap tides, selected by Sir Isaac Newton for this purpose. This proportion must depend on many local circumstances. When a wave or tide comes to the mouths of two rivers, and finds a tide up each, and another tide of half the magnitude comes a fortnight after; the proportion of tides sent up to any given places of these rivers may be extremely different. Nay, the proportion of tides sent up to two distant places of the same river can hardly be the same; nor are they the same in any river that we know. It can be demonstrated, in the strictest manner, that the farther we go up the river, where the declivity is greater, the neap tide will be smaller in proportion to the spring tide. But it does not appear that the time of succession of the different tides will be much affected by local circumstances. The tide of the second day of the moon being very little less than that of the first, will be nearly as much retarded, and the intervals between their arrivals cannot be very different from the real intervals of the undisturbed tides; accordingly, the succession of the highest to the highest but one is found to be the same in all places, when not disturbed by different winds. In like manner, the succession of the lowest and the lowest but one is found equally invariable; and the highest and the lowest tides observed in any place must be accounted the spring and neap tides of that place, whether they happen on the day of full and half moon or not. Nay, we can see here the explanation of a general deviation of the theory which we formerly noticed. A low tide, being less able to overcome obstructions, will be sooner stopped, and the neap tides should happen a little earlier than by the undisturbed theory.\n\nWith all these corrections, the theory now delivered will be found to correspond with observation, with all the exactness that we can reasonably expect. We had an opportunity of comparing it with the phenomena in a place where they are very singular, viz. in the harbour of Biskudet in Iceland. The equator of the watery spheroid frequently passes through the neighbourhood of this place, in a variety of positions with respect to its parallel of diurnal revolution, and the differences of superior and inferior tides are most remarkable and various. We found a wonderful conformity to the most diversified circumstances of the theory.\n\nThere is a period of 18 years, respecting the tides in Iceland, taken notice of by the ancient Saxons; but it is not distinctly described. Now this is the period of the moon's nodes, and of the greatest and least inclination of her orbit to the equator. It is therefore the period of the positions of the equator of the tides which ranges round this island, and very sensibly affects them.\n\nHitherto we have supposed the tides to be formed on an ocean completely covering the earth. Let us see how those may be determined which happen in a small and confined sea, such as the Caspian or the Black sea. The determination in this case is very simple. As no supply of water is supposed to come into the basin, it is susceptible of a tide only by sinking at one end and rising at the other. This may be illustrated by fig. 6, where \\(C_x, C_y\\) are two perpendicular planes bounding a small portion of the natural ocean. The water will sink at \\(z\\) and rise at \\(x\\), and form a surface \\(o r\\) parallel to the equilibrated surface \\(y s\\). It is evident that there will be high water, or the greatest possible rise, at \\(r\\), when the basin comes to that position where the tangent is most of all inclined to the diameter. This will be when the angle \\(tCB\\) is 45\u00b0 nearly, and therefore three lunar hours after the moon's setting; at the same time, it will be low water at the other end. It is plain that the rise and fall must be exceedingly small, and that there will be no change in the middle. The tides of this kind in the Caspian sea, in latitude 45\u00b0, whose extent in longitude does not exceed eight degrees, are not above seven inches; a quantity so small, that a slight breeze of wind is sufficient to check it, and even to produce a rise of the waters in the opposite direction. We have not met with any accounts of a tide being observed in this sea.\n\nIt should be much greater, though still very small, in the Mediterranean sea. Accordingly, tides are observed there, but still more remarkably in the Adriatic, for a reason which will be given by and by. We do not know that tides have been observed in the great lakes of North America. These tides, though small, should be very regular.\n\nShould there be another great basin in the neighbourhood of \\(z x\\), lying east or west of it, we should observe a curious phenomenon. It would be low water on one side of the shore \\(z\\) when it is high water on the other side of this partition. If the tides in the Euxine and Caspian seas, or in the American lakes which are near each other, could be observed, this phenomenon should appear, and would be one of the prettiest examples of universal gravitation that can be conceived. Something like it is to be seen at Gibraltar. It is high water on the east side of the rock about 10 o'clock at full and change, and it is high water on the west side, not a mile distant, at 12. This difference is perhaps the chief cause of the singular current which is observed in the Straits mouth. There are three currents observed at the same time, which change their directions every 12 hours. The small tide of the Mediterranean proceeds along the Barbary shore, which is very uniform all the way from Egypt, with tolerable regularity. But along the northern side, where it is greatly obstructed by Italy, the islands, and the east coast of Spain, it flows very irregularly; and the perceptible high water on the Spanish coast differs four hours from that of the southern coast. Thus it happens, that one tide ranges round Europa point, and another along the shore near Ceuta, and there is a third current in the middle different from both. Its general direction is from the Atlantic.\nAtlantic ocean into the Mediterranean sea, but it sometimes comes out when the ebb tide in the Atlantic is considerable.\n\nSuppose the moon over the middle of the Mediterranean. The surface of the sea will be level, and it will be half tide at both ends, and therefore within the Straits of Gibraltar. But without the Straits it is within half an hour of high water. Therefore there will be a current setting in from the Atlantic. About three and a half hours after, it is high water within and half ebb without. The current now sets out from the Mediterranean. Three hours later, it is low water without the Straits and half ebb within; therefore the current has been setting out all this while. Three hours later, it is half flood without the Straits and low water within, and the current is again setting in, &c.\n\nWere the earth fluid to the centre, the only sensible motion of the waters would be up and down, like the waves on the open ocean, which are not brushed along by strong gales. But the shallowness of the channel makes a horizontal motion necessary, that water may be supplied to form the accumulation of the tide. When this is formed on a flat shelving coast, the water must flow in and out, on the flats and sands, while it rises and falls. These horizontal motions must be greatly modified by the channel or bed along which they move. When the channel contracts along the line of flowing water, the wave, as it moves up the channel, and is checked by the narrowing shores, must be reflected back, and keep a-top of the waters still flowing in underneath. Thus it may rise higher in these narrow seas than in the open ocean. This may serve to explain a little the great tides which happen on some coasts, such as the coast of Normandy. At St Malo the flood frequently rises 50 feet. But we cannot give any thing like a full or satisfactory account of these singularities. In the bay of Fundy, and particularly at Annapolis Royal, the water sometimes rises above 100 feet. This seems quite inexplicable by any force of the sun and moon, which cannot raise the waters of the free ocean more than eight feet. These great floods are unquestionably owing to the proper timing of certain oscillations or currents adjoining, by which they unite, and form one of great force. Such violent motions of water are frequently seen on a small scale in the motions of brooks and rivers; but we are too little acquainted with hydraulics to explain them with any precision.\n\nWe have seen that there is an oscillation of waters formed under the sun and moon; and that in consequence of the rotation of the earth, the inertia and the want of perfect fluidity of the waters, and obstructions in the channel, this accumulation never reaches the place where it would finally settle if the earth did not turn round its axis. The consequence of this must be a general current of the waters from east to west. This may be seen in another way. The moon in her orbit round the earth has her gravity to the earth diminished by the sun's disturbing force, and therefore moves in an orbit less incurvated than she would describe independent of the sun's action. She therefore employs a longer time. If the moon were so near the earth as almost to touch it, the same thing would happen. Therefore suppose the moon turning round the earth, almost in contact with the equator, with her natural undisturbed periodic time, and that the earth is revolving round its axis in the same time, the moon would remain continually above the same spot of the earth's surface (suppose the city of Quito), and a spectator in another planet would see the moon always covering the same spot. Now let the sun act. This will not affect the rotation of the earth, because the action on one part is exactly balanced by the action on another. But it will affect the moon. It will move more slowly round the earth's centre, and at a greater distance. It will be left behind by the city of Quito, which it formerly covered. And as the earth moves round from west to east, the moon, moving more slowly, will have a motion to the west with respect to Quito. In like manner, every particle of water has its gravity diminished, and its diurnal motion retarded; and hence arises a general motion or current from east to west. This is very distinctly perceived in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. It comes round the Cape of Good Hope, ranges along the coast of Africa, and then sets directly over to America, where it meets a similar stream which comes in by the north of Europe. Meeting the shores of America, it is deflected both to the south along the coast of Brazil, and to the north along the North American shores, where it forms what is called the Gulf Stream, because it comes from the gulf of Mexico. This motion is indeed very slow, this being sufficient for the accumulation of seven or eight feet on the deep ocean; but it is not altogether inef\ufb01cient.\n\nWe may expect differences in the appearances on the western shores of Europe and Africa, and on the western shores of America, from the appearances on the eastern coasts of America and of Asia, for the general current obstructs the waters from the western shores, and sends them to the eastern shores. Also when we compare the wide opening of the northern extremity of the Atlantic ocean with the narrow opening between Kamtchatka and America, we should expect differences between the appearances on the west coasts of Europe and of America. The observations made during the circumnavigation of Captain Cook and others show a remarkable difference. All along the west coast of North America the inferior tide is very trifling, and frequently is not perceived.\n\nIn the very same manner, the disturbing forces of the sun and moon form a tide in the fluid air which surrounds this globe, consisting of an elevation and depression, which move gradually from east to west. Neither does this tide ever attain that position with respect to the disturbing planets which it would do were the earth at rest on its axis. Hence arises a motion of the whole air from east to west; and this is the principal cause of the trade-winds. They are a little accelerated by being heated, and therefore expanding. They expand more to the westward than in the opposite direction, because the air expands on that side into air which is now cooling and contracting. These winds very evidently follow the sun's motion, tending more to the south or north as he goes south or north. Were this motion considerably affected by the expansion of heated air, we should find the air rather coming northward and southward from the torrid zone, in consequence of its expansion in that climate. We repeat it, it is almost solely produced by the aerial tide, and is necessary for the very formation of this tide. We cannot perceive the accumulation. It cannot affect the barometer, as many\nmany think, because, though the air becomes deeper, it becomes deeper only because it is made lighter by the gravitation to the sun. Instead of pressing more on the cistern of the barometer, we imagine that it presses less; because, like the ocean, it never attains the height to which it tends. It remains always too low for equilibrium, and therefore it should press with less force on the cistern of a barometer.\n\nThere is an appearance precisely similar to this in the planet Jupiter. He is surrounded by an atmosphere which is arranged in zones or belts, probably owing to climate differences of the different latitudes, by which each seems to have a different kind of sky. Something like this will appear to a spectator in the moon looking at this earth. The general weather and appearance of the sky is considerably different in the torrid and temperate zones. Jupiter's belts are not of a constant shape and colour; but there often appear large spots or tracts of cloud, which retain their shape during several revolutions of Jupiter round his axis. To judge of his rotation by one of these, we should say that he turns round in 9.55. There is also a brighter spot which is frequently seen, occupying one certain situation on the body of Jupiter. This is surely adherent to his body, and is either a bright coloured country, or perhaps a tract of clouds hovering over some volcano. This spot turns round in 9.51. And thus there is a general current in his atmosphere from east to west.\n\nBoth the motion of the air and of the water tend to diminish the rotation of the earth round its axis; for they move slower than the earth, because they are retarded by the luminaries. They must communicate this retardation to the earth, and must take from it a quantity of motion precisely equal to what they want, in order to make up the equilibrated tide. In all probability this retardation is compensated by other causes; for no retardation can be observed. This would have altered the length of the year since the time of Hipparchus, giving it a smaller number of days. We see causes of compensation. The continual washing down of soil from the elevated parts of the earth must produce this effect, by communicating to the valley on which it is brought to reflect the excess of diurnal velocity which it had on the mountain top.\n\nWhile we were employed on this article, a book was put into our hands called Studies of Nature, by Mr Saint Pierre. This author attacks the Newtonian theory of the tides, as erroneous in principle, and as quite insufficient for explaining the phenomena; and he attributes all phenomena of the tides to the liquefaction of the ices and snows of the circumpolar regions, and the greater length of the polar than of the equatorial axis of the earth. He is a man of whom we wish to speak with respect, for his constant attention to final causes, and the proof thence resulting of the wisdom and goodness of God. For this he is entitled to the greater praise, that it required no small degree of fortitude to reflect the influence of national example, and to retain his piety in the midst of a people who have drunk the very dregs of the atheism of ancient Greece. This is a species of merit rarely to be met with in a Frenchman of the present day; but as a philosopher, M. de St Pierre can lay claim to no other merit except that of having collected many important facts. The argument which he employs to prove that the earth is a prolate spheroid, is a direct demonstration of the truth of the contrary opinion; and the melting of the ice and snows at the poles cannot produce the smallest motion in the waters. Were there even ten times more ice and snow floating on the northern sea than there is, and were it all to melt in one minute, there would be no flux from it; for it would only fill up the space which it formerly occupied in the water. Of this any person will be convinced, who shall put a handful of snow squeezed hard into a jar of water, and note the exact height of the water. Let the snow melt, and he will find the water of the same height as before.\n\nTIDE-Waiters, or Tide-men, are inferior officers belonging to the customhouse, whose employment is to watch or attend upon ships until the customs be paid: they get this name from their going on board ships on their arrival in the mouth of the Thames or other ports, and so come up with the tide.","sp":26,"ep":49},{"h":"TIEND","t":"in Scots Law.

He studied in Clare-hall, Cambridge; and in 1656 left this college, in order to become tutor to the son of Edmund Prideaux, Esq., of Ford abbey in Devonshire. He was afterwards curate to Dr Hacket vicar of Cheshunt, in Hertfordshire. In 1663, he was presented by Sir Thomas Barnardiston to the rectory of Ketton or Kedington in the county of Suffolk; but was the next year chosen preacher to Lincoln's Inn, when he procured Ketton to be bestowed on his curate. He was greatly admired in London for his sermons; and in the same year was chosen Tuesday-lecturer at St Lawrence's church, London, where his lectures were frequented by\nall the divines of the city, and by many persons of quality and distinction. In 1666, he took the degree of Doctor of Divinity at Cambridge; in 1669, was made prebendary of Canterbury; in 1672, was admitted dean of that cathedral; and three years after, was made a prebendary of St Paul's cathedral, London. In 1679, he became acquainted with Charles earl of Shrewsbury, whom he converted from Popery; and the next year refused to sign the clergy of London's address of thanks to King Charles II. for not agreeing to the bill of exclusion of the duke of York. In 1683, he visited the unfortunate Lord Ruffell when under condemnation; and attended him in his last moments on the scaffold. In 1689, he was installed dean of St Paul's; made clerk of the closet to King William and Queen Mary; and appointed one of the commissioners to prepare matters to be laid before the convocation, in order to a comprehension of all Protestants, as well dissenters as churchmen; but this attempt was frustrated by the zeal of those members of that body, who refused to admit of any alteration in things confessedly indifferent. In 1691, Dr Tillotson was, notwithstanding the warmest remonstrances and intrigues on his part, consecrated archbishop of Canterbury, and four days after was sworn one of the privy council; their majesties always repaying an entire confidence in his prudence, moderation, and integrity. In 1694, he was seized with a palsy, of which he died in the 65th year of his age. He was interred in the church of St Lawrence Jewry, London, where a handsome monument is erected to his memory. This learned and pious divine, while living, was greatly inveighed against by the enemies of the revolution. After his death there was found a bundle of bitter libels which had been published against him, on which he had written with his own hand, \"I forgive the authors of these books, and pray God that he may also forgive them.\" It is remarkable, that while this truly great man was in a private station, he always laid aside two-tenths of his income for charitable uses. One volume in folio of Dr Tillotson's sermons was published in his life-time, and corrected by his own hand; they were translated into French by Barbeyrac. Those which came abroad after his death, from his chaplain Dr Barker, made two volumes in folio, the copy of which was sold for \u00a3500. This was the only legacy he left to his family, his extensive charity having consumed his yearly revenues as constantly as they came to his hands. King William, however, gave two grants to his widow; the first of which was an annuity of \u00a3400, during the term of her natural life, and the second of \u00a3200, as an addition to the former annuity. Dr Tillotson wrote some other works besides his Sermons; and also published Dr Barrow's works, and Dr Wilkins's Treatise of the Principles and Duties of Natural Religion, and a volume of that divine's Sermons.","sp":49,"ep":50},{"h":"TIMBER","t":"wood fit for building, &c.

See Lyre.\n\nWith respect to the number of strings upon the lyre of Timotheus: The account of Pausanias and Suidas is confirmed in the famous senatus-consultum against him, still extant, preserved at full length in Boethius. Mr Stillingfleet has given an extract from it, in proof of the simplicity of the ancient Spartan music. The fact is mentioned in Athenaeus; and C\u00e6sabon, in his notes upon that author, has inserted the whole original text from Boethius, with corrections. The following is a faithful translation of this extraordinary Spartan act of parliament. \"Whereas Timotheus the Milesian, coming to our city, has dishonoured our ancient music, and, defiling the lyre of seven strings, has, by the introduction of a greater variety of notes, corrupted the ears of our youth; and by the number of his strings, and the novelty of his melody, has given to our music an effeminate and artificial dress, instead of the plain and orderly one in which it has hitherto appeared; rendering melody infamous, by composing in the chromatic instead of the enharmonic:\u2014The kings and the ephori have therefore resolved to pass sentence upon Timotheus for these things: and, farther, to oblige him to cut all the superfluous strings of his eleven, leaving only the seven tones; and to banish him from our city; that men may be warned for the future not to introduce into Sparta any unbecoming custom.\"\n\nThe same story, as related in Athen\u00e6us, has this additional circumstance. That when the public executioner was on the point of fulfilling the sentence, by cutting off the new strings, Timotheus, perceiving a little statue in the same place, with a lyre in his hand of as many strings as that which had given the offence, and showing it to the judges, was acquitted.\n\nIt appears from Suidas, that the poetical and musical compositions of Timotheus were very numerous, and of various kinds. He attributes to him 19 nomes, or canticles, in hexameters; 36 poems, or preludes; 18 dithyrambs; 21 hymns; the poem in praise of Diana; one panegyric; three tragedies, the Persians, Ph\u0153nissas, and Laertes; to which must be added a fourth, mentioned Timotheus by several ancient authors, called Niobe, without forgetting the poem on the birth of Bacchus. Stephen of Byzantium makes him author of 18 books of nomes, or airs, for the cithara, to 8000 verses; and of 1000 Hymnus, or preludes, for the nomes of the flutes.\n\nTimotheus died in Macedonia, according to Suidas, at the age of 97; though the Martyrs, much better authority, lay at 92; and Stephen of Byzantium fixes his death in the fourth year of the 105th Olympiad, two years before the birth of Alexander the Great; whence it appears, that this Timotheus was not the famous player on the flute so much esteemed by that prince, who was animated to such a degree by his performance as to seize his arms; and who employed him, as Athen\u00e6us informs us, together with the other great musicians of his time, at his nuptials. However, by an inattention to dates, and by forgetting that of these two musicians of the same name the one was a Milesian and the other a Theban, they have been hitherto often confounded.\n\nTIMUR-BEG.

It is 150 miles in length, and 120 in breadth, and contains 28 large towns.\n\nThe face of the country is very mountainous. Of these mountains, some have their tops always buried in snow; others are covered with woods, abounding with a variety of game; and others are rich in metals, and marble of all colours. Of the lower, some yield plenty of corn, others wine, and woods of chestnut trees. The valleys are exceeding fertile also, and pleasant. In some places considerable quantities of flax are raised, in others there is a good breed of horses and horned cattle; and, among the mountains, abundance of chamois and wild goats. In this country are also found precious stones of several sorts; as garnets, rubies, amethysts, emeralds, and a species of diamonds, agates, carnelians, calcadoes, malachites, &c.; nor is it without hot baths, acid waters, salt pits, mines of silver, copper, and lead, mineral colours, alum, and vitriol. The principal river of Tirol is the Inn, which, after traversing the country, and receiving a number of lesser streams into it, enters Bavaria, in which, at Passau, it falls into the Danube. The men here are very tall, robust, and vigorous; the women also are stout, and generally fair; and both sexes have a mixture of the Italian and German in their tempers and characters. As there is little trade or manufacture in the country, except what is occasioned by the mines and salt works, many of the common people are obliged to seek a subsistence elsewhere. A particular kind of salutation is used all over Tirol. When a person comes into a house, he says, \"Hail! Jesus Christ;\" the answer is, \"May Christ be praised, and the Holy Virgin his mother.\" Then the master of the house takes the visitor by the hand. This salutation is fixed up in print at all the doors, with an advertisement tacked to it, importing, that Pope Clement XI. granted 100 days indulgence, and a plenary abolution, to those who should pronounce the salutation and answer, as often as they did it. The emperor has forts and citadels so advantageously situated on rocks and mountains all over the country, that they command all the valleys, avenues, and passes that lead unto it. The inhabitants, however, to keep them in good humour, are more gently treated, and not so highly taxed as those of the other hereditary countries. As to the states, they are much the same in this country as in the other Austrian territories, except that the peasants here send deputies to the diets. Tirol came to the house of Austria in the year 1363, when Margaret, countess thereof, bequeathed it to her uncles the dukes of Austria. The arms of Tirol are an eagle gules, in a field argent. The counts of Trap are hereditary stewards; the lords of Glotz, chamberlains; the princes of Trautson, marshals; the counts of Wolfenstein, masters of the horse and carvers; the house of Spaur, cup-bearers; the counts of Kungl., sewers and rangers; the counts of Brandis, keepers of the jewels; the house of Welsberg, purveyors and staff-bearers; and the counts of Coalto, falconers. Besides the governor, there are three sovereign colleges, subordinate to the court at Vienna, which sit at Innspruck, and have their different departments. Towards the expenses of the military establishment of this country, the proportion is 100,000 florins yearly; but no more than one regiment of foot is generally quartered in it.\n\nTirol is divided into six quarters, as they are called; namely, those of the Lower and Upper Innthal, Vintfogow, Etch, Eifack, and Pufferthal.","sp":52,"ep":52},{"h":"TITAN","t":"in fabulous history, the son of Coelus and Terra, and the elder brother of Saturn, suffered the latter to enjoy the crown, on condition that he should bring up none of his male issue, by which means the crown should at length revert to him; but Jupiter being spared by the address of Rhea, Saturn's wife, Titan and his children were so enraged at seeing their hopes frustrated, that they took up arms to revenge the injury; and not only defeated Saturn, but kept him and his wife prisoners till he was delivered by Jupiter, who defeated the Titans; when from the blood of these Titans slain in the battle, proceeded serpents, scorpions, and all venomous reptiles. See SATURN.\n\nSuch is the account given by the poets of this family of Grecian and Roman gods. From the fragments of Sanchoniathon, however, and other ancient writers, many learned men have inferred that the Titans were an early race of ambitious heroes, who laid the foundation of that idolatry which quickly overspread the world, and\nthat by assuming the names of the luminaries of heaven they contrived to get themselves everywhere adored as the Dii majorum gentium. That the word Titan signifies the sun, there can indeed be very little doubt. Every one knows that such was its signification in the \u00c6olic dialect; and as it is evidently compounded of Ti, which, in some oriental tongues, signifies bright or clear, and Tan, which signifies a country or the earth, it may be fairly concluded that Titan was the name of the sun before the word was imported into Greece. But the great question among antiquarians is, of what country was that race which, assuming to themselves the names of the heavenly bodies, introduced into the world that species of idolatry which is known by the appellation of Hero-worship?\n\nM. Pezron, in a work published many years ago, and entitled The Antiquities of Nations, maintains that the Titans were a family of Sace or Scythians, who made their first appearance beyond Media and Mount Imaus, in the upper regions of Asia; that they were the descendants of Gomer the son of Japheth and grandson of Noah; and that after conquering a great part of the world, upon entering Upper Phrygia, they quitted their ancient name of Gomerians or Cimmerians, and assumed that of Titans. All this, he says, happened before the birth of Abraham and the foundation of the Assyrian monarchy; and he makes Uranus, their second prince in the order of succession, to have conquered Thrace, Greece, the island of Crete, and a great part of Europe. Uranus was succeeded by Saturn, and Saturn by Jupiter, who flourished, he says, 300 years before Moses, and divided his vast empire between himself, his brother Pluto, and his cousin-german Atlas, who was called Telamon. For the truth of this genealogy of the Titans M. Pezron appeals to the most approved Greek historians; but unluckily for his hypothesis, these writers have not a single sentence by which it can be fairly supported. It supposes not only the great antiquity of the Scythians, but likewise their early progress in arts and sciences, contrary to what we have proved in other articles of this work. See Sculpture, no 4 and 5.\n\nOthers, taking the fragment of Sanchoniatho's Phoenician history for their guide, have supposed the Titans to have been the descendants of Ham. Of this opinion was Bishop Cumberland; and our learned friend Dr Deig, to whom we have been indebted for greater favours, indulged us with the perusal of a manuscript, in which, with erudition and ingenuity struggling for the pre-eminence, he traces that impious family from the profane son of Noah, and shows by what means they spread the idolatrous worship of themselves over the greater part of the ancient world. Cronus, of whose exploits some account has been given elsewhere (see Sanchoniatho), he holds to be Ham; and tracing the progress of the family from Phoenicia to Cyprus, from Cyprus to Rhodes, thence to Crete, and from Crete to Samothrace, he finds reason to conclude that the branch called Titans or Titanides flourished about the era of Abraham, with whom, or with his son Isaac, he thinks the Cretan Jupiter must have been contemporary. As they proceeded from countries which were the original seat of civilization to others in which mankind had sunk into the grossest barbarism, it was easy for them to persuade the ignorant inhabitants that they derived the arts of civil life from their parent the sun, and in consequence of their relation to him to assume to themselves divine honours. To ask how they came to think of such gross impiety, is a question as foolish as it would be to ask how Ham their ancestor became so wicked as to entail the curse of God upon himself and his posterity. The origin of evil is involved in difficulties; but leaving all inquiries into it to be prosecuted by the metaphysician and moralist, it is surely more probable that the worship of dead men originated among the descendants of Ham than among those of Shem and Japheth; and that the fragment of Sanchoniatho, when giving an account of the origin of the Titans, the undoubted authors of that worship, is more deserving of credit than the fabulous and comparatively late writers of Greece and Rome.","sp":52,"ep":53},{"h":"TITHES","t":"in ecclesiastical law, are defined to be the tenth part of the increase, yearly arising and renewing from the profits of lands, the stock upon lands, and the personal industry of the inhabitants: the first species being usually called predial, as of corn, grapes, hops, and wood; the second mixed, as of wool, milk, pigs, &c., consisting of natural products, but nurtured and preserved in part by the care of man; and of these the tenth must be paid in goods; the third personal, as of manual occupations, trades, fisheries, and the like; and of these only the tenth-part of the clear gains and profits is due.\n\nWe shall, in this article, consider, 1. The original of the right of tithes. 2. In whom that right at present subsists. 3. Who may be discharged, either totally or in part, from paying them.\n\n1. As to their original, we will not put the title of the clergy to tithes upon any divine right; though such a right certainly commenced, and we believe as certainly ceased, with the Jewish theocracy. Yet an honourable and competent maintenance for the ministers of the gospel is undoubtedly jure divino, whatever the particular mode of that maintenance may be. For, besides the positive precepts of the New Testament, natural reason will tell us, that an order of men who are separated from the world, and excluded from other lucrative professions for the sake of the rest of mankind, have a right to be furnished with the necessaries, conveniences, and moderate enjoyments of life, at their expense; for whose benefit they forego the usual means of providing them. Accordingly all municipal laws have provided a liberal and decent maintenance for their national priests or clergy; ours, in particular, have established this of tithes, probably in imitation of the Jewish law: and perhaps, considering the degenerate state of the world in general, it may be more beneficial to the English clergy to found their title on the law of the land, than upon any divine right whatsoever, unacknowledged and unsupported by temporal sanctions.\n\nWe cannot precisely ascertain the time when tithes were first introduced into this country. Possibly they were contemporary with the planting of Christianity among the Saxons by Augustin the monk, about the end of the fifth century. But the first mention of them which we have met with in any written English law, is a constitutional decree, made in a synod held A.D. 786, wherein the payment of tithes in general is strongly enjoined. This canon or decree, which at first bound not the laity, was effectually confirmed by two kingdoms.\nkingdoms of the heptarchy, in their parliamentary conventions of estates, respectively consisting of the kings of Mercia and Northumberland, the bishops, dukes, senators, and people. Which was a few years later than the time that Charlemagne established the payment of them in France, and made that famous division of them into four parts; one to maintain the edifice of the church, the second to support the poor, the third the bishop, and the fourth the parochial clergy.\n\nThe next authentic mention of them is in the f\u00e6dus Edwardi et Guthrunis or the laws agreed upon between King Guthrun the Dane, and Alfred his son Edward the Elder, successive kings of England, about the year 920. This was a kind of treaty between those monarchs, which may be found at large in the Anglo-Saxon laws: wherein it was necessary, as Guthrun was a Pagan, to provide for the subsistence of the Christian clergy under his dominion; and accordingly, we find the payment of tithes not only enjoined, but a penalty added upon non-obscurrence: which law is seconded by the laws of Athelstan, about the year 930. And this is as much as can certainly be traced out with regard to their legal original.\n\n2. We are next to consider the persons to whom tithes are due. Upon their first introduction, though every man was obliged to pay tithes in general, yet he might give them to what priests he pleased; which were called arbitrary consecrations of tithes; or he might pay them into the hands of the bishop, who distributed among his diocesan clergy the revenues of the church, which were then in common. But when dioceses were divided into parishes, the tithes of each parish were allotted to its own particular minister; first by common consent or the appointments of lords of manors, and afterwards by the written law of the land.\n\nArbitrary consecrations of tithes took place again afterwards, and were in general use till the time of King John. This was probably owing to the intrigues of the regular clergy, or monks of the Benedictine and other orders, under Archbishop Dunstan and his successors; who endeavoured to wean the people from paying their dues to the secular or parochial clergy (a much more valuable set of men than themselves), and were then in hopes to have drawn, by sanctimonious pretences to extraordinary purity of life, all ecclesiastical profits to the coffers of their own societies. And this will naturally enough account for the number and riches of the monasteries and religious houses which were founded in those days, and which were frequently endowed with tithes. For a layman, who was obliged to pay his tithes somewhere, might think it good policy to erect an abbey, and there pay them to his own monks, or grant them to some abbey already erected: since for this donation, which really cost the patron little or nothing, he might, according to the superstition of the times, have masses for ever sung for his soul. But in process of years, the income of the poor laborious parish-priests being scandalously reduced by these arbitrary consecrations of tithes, it was remedied by Pope Innocent III. about the year 1200, in a decretal epistle sent to the archbishop of Canterbury, and dated from the palace of Lateran: which has occasioned Sir Henry Hobart and others to mistake it for a decree of the council of Lateran, held A.D. 1179, which only prohibited what was called the infodation of tithes; or their being granted to mere laymen; whereas this letter of Pope Innocent to the archbishop enjoined the payment of tithes to the parsons of the respective parishes where every man inhabited, agreeable to what was afterwards directed by the same pope in other countries. This epistle, says Sir Edward Coke, bound not the lay subjects of this realm; but being reasonable and just, it was allowed of, and so became lex terr\u00e6. This put an effectual stop to all the arbitrary consecrations of tithes; except some footsteps which still continue in those portions of tithes which the parson of one parish hath, though rarely, a right to claim in another: for it is now universally held, that tithes are due, of common right, to the parson of the parish, unless there be a special exemption. This parson of the parish may be either the actual incumbent, or else the appropriator of the benefice; appropriations being a method of endowing monasteries, which seems to have been devised by the regular clergy, by way of substitution to arbitrary consecrations of tithes.\n\n3. We observed that tithes are due of common right to the parson, unless by special exemption; let us therefore see, thirdly, who may be exempted from the payment of tithes, and how lands and their occupiers may be exempted or discharged from the payment of tithes, either in part or totally; first, by a real composition; or, secondly, by custom or prescription.\n\nFirst. A real composition is when an agreement is made between the owner of the lands and the parson or vicar, with the consent of the ordinary and the patron; that such lands shall for the future be discharged from payment of tithes, by reason of some land or other real recompense given to the parson in lieu and satisfaction thereof. This was permitted by law, because it was supposed that the clergy would be no losers by such composition; since the consent of the ordinary, whose duty it is to take care of the church in general, and of the patron, whose interest it is to protect that particular church, were both made necessary to render the composition effectual: and hence have arisen all such compositions as exist at this day by force of the common law. But experience showing that even this caution was ineffectual, and the petitions of the church being by this and other means every day diminished, the disabling statute 13 Eliz. c. 10. was made; which prevents, among other spiritual persons, all parsons and vicars from making any conveyances of the estates of their churches, other than for three lives of 21 years. So that now, by virtue of this statute, no real composition made since the 13 Eliz. is good for any longer term than three lives or 21 years, though made by consent of the patron and ordinary: which has indeed effectually demolished this kind of traffic; such compositions being now rarely heard of, unless by authority of parliament.\n\nSecondly, a discharge by custom or prescription, is where time out of mind such persons or such lands have been either partially or totally discharged from the payment of tithes. And this immemorial usage is binding upon all parties; as it is in its nature an evidence of universal consent and acquiescence, and with reason supposes a real composition to have been formerly made. This custom or prescription is either de modo decimandi, or de non decimando.\n\nA modus decimandi, commonly called by the simple name of a modus only, is where there is by custom a particular\nparticular manner of tithing allowed, different from the general law of taking tithe in kind, which are the actual tenth-part of the annual increase. This is sometimes a pecuniary compensation, as twopence an acre for the tithe of land; sometimes it is a compensation in work and labour, as that the parson shall have only the twelfth cock of hay, and not the tenth, in consideration of the owner's making it for him; sometimes, in lieu of a large quantity of crude or imperfect tithe, the parson shall have a less quantity when arrived at greater maturity, as a couple of fowls in lieu of tithe-eggs, and the like. Any means, in short, whereby the general law of tithing is altered, and a new method of taking them is introduced, is called a modus decimandi, or special manner of tithing.\n\nA prescription de non decimando is a claim to be entirely discharged of tithes, and to pay no compensation in lieu of them. Thus the king by his prerogative is discharged from all tithes. So a vicar shall pay no tithes to the rector, nor the rector to the vicar, for ecclesia decimas non facit ecclesia. But these personal privileges (not arising from or being annexed to the land) are personally confined to both the king and the clergy; for their tenant or lesee shall pay tithes, though in their own occupation their lands are not generally tithable. And, generally speaking, it is an established rule, that in lay hands, modus de non decimando non valet. But spiritual persons or corporations, as monasteries, abbeys, bishops, and the like, were always capable of having their lands totally discharged of tithes by various ways: as, 1. By real composition. 2. By the pope's bull of exemption. 3. By unity of possession; as when the rectory of a parish, and lands in the same parish, both belonged to a religious house, those lands were discharged of tithes by this unity of possession. 4. By prescription; having never been liable to tithes, by being always in spiritual hands. 5. By virtue of their order; as the Knights Templars, Cistercians, and others, whose lands were privileged by the pope with a discharge of tithes. Though, upon the dissolution of abbeys by Henry VIII., most of these exemptions from tithes would have fallen with them, and the lands become tithable again, had they not been supported and upheld by the statute 31 Henry VIII. c. 13, which enacts, that all persons who should come to the possession of the lands of any abbey then dissolved, should hold them free and discharged of tithes, in as large and ample a manner as the abbeys themselves formerly held them. And from this original have sprung all the lands which being in lay hands, do at present claim to be tithe-free; for if a man can show his lands to have been such abbey-lands, and also immemorially discharged of tithes by any of the means before mentioned, this is now a good prescription de non decimando. But he must show both these requisites: for abbey-lands, without a special ground of discharge, are not discharged of course; neither will any prescription de non decimando avail in total discharge of tithes, unless it relates to such abbey-lands.\n\nIt is universally acknowledged that the payment of tithes in kind is a great discouragement to agriculture. They are inconvenient and vexatious to the husbandman, and operate as an impolitic tax upon industry. The clergyman, too, frequently finds them troublesome and precarious; his expenses in collecting are a considerable drawback from their value, and his just rights are with difficulty secured: he is too often obliged to submit to imposition, or is embroiled with his parishioners in disputes and litigations, no less irksome to his feelings than prejudicial to his interest, and tending to prevent those good effects which his precepts should produce. It is therefore of the utmost importance to parochial tranquillity, and even to religion, that some just and reasonable standard of composition could be fixed. Land has been proposed, but in the present state of the division of property this is impossible: and as money is continually changing in its value, it would also be a very improper standard, unless some plan could be formed by which the composition could be increased as the value of money diminishes. A plan of this kind has been published in the Transactions of the Society instituted at Bath, vol. iv. which those who are interested in this subject may consult for farther information.","sp":53,"ep":55},{"h":"TITHING","t":"(Tithinga, from the Sax.

Diccionary dore, in the province of Friuli, in the state of Venice, of Painters in 1477, or in 1480 according to Vafari and Sandrart. His parents sent him at ten years of age to one of his uncles at Venice, who finding that he had an inclination to painting, put him to the school of Giovanni Bellino.\n\nBut as soon as Titian had seen the works of Giorgione, whose manner appeared to him abundantly more elegant, and less constrained than that of Bellino, he determined to quite the style to which he had so long been accustomed, and to pursue the other that recommended itself to him, by having more force, more relief, more nature, and more truth. Some authors affirm, that he placed himself as a disciple with Giorgione; yet others only say, that he cultivated an intimacy with him; but it is undoubtedly certain that he studied with that great master; that he learned his method of blending and uniting the colours; and practised his manner so effectually, that several of the paintings of Titian were taken for the performances of Giorgione; and then his success inspired that artist with an invincible jealousy of Titian, which broke off their connection for ever after.\n\nThe reputation of Titian rose continually; every new work contributed to extend his fame through all Europe; and he was considered as the principal ornament of the age in which he flourished. And yet, Sandrart observes that amidst all his applause, and constant employment at Venice, his income and fortune were inconsiderable;\nand he was more remarkable for the extensiveness of his talents, than for the affluence of his circumstances. But when his merit was made known to the emperor Charles V., that monarch knew how to set a just value on his superior abilities; he enriched him by repeated bounties, allowed him a considerable pension, conferred on him the honour of knighthood, and what was still more, honoured him with his friendship. He painted the portrait of that benefactor several times; and it is recorded by Sandrart, that one day, while the emperor was sitting for his picture, a pencil happening to drop from the painter, he stooped, took it up, and returned it; obligingly answering to the modest apology of the artist (who blushed at the condescension of so great a monarch), that the merit of a Titian was worthy of the attendance of an emperor.\n\nThe excellence of Titian was not so remarkably apparent in the historical compositions which he painted as in his portraits and landscapes, which seem to be superior to all competition; and even to this day, many of them preserve their original beauty, being as much the admiration of the present age as they have deservedly been of the ages past.\u2014It is observed of Titian by most writers, that in the different periods of his life, he had four different manners; one resembling his first instructor Bellino, which was somewhat stiff; another, in imitation of Giorgione, more bold, and full of force; his third manner was the result of experience, knowledge, and judgement, beautifully natural, and finished with exquisite care, which manner was peculiarly his own; and in those pictures which he painted between the years of approaching old age and his death may be noticed his fourth manner. His portraits were very differently finished in his early, and in his latter time, according to the testimony of Sandrart. At first he laboured his pictures highly, and gave them a polished beauty and lustre, so as produce their effect full as well when they were examined closely as when viewed at a distance; but afterwards, he so managed his penciling, that their greatest force and beauty appeared at a more remote view, and they pleased less when they were beheld more nearly. So that many of those artists who studied to imitate him, being misled by appearances which they did not sufficiently consider, have imagined that Titian executed his work with readiness and a masterly rapidity; and concluded that they should imitate his manner most effectually by a freedom of hand and a bold pencil: Whereas in reality, Titian took abundance of pains to work up his pictures to so high a degree of perfection; and the freedom that appears in the handling was entirely effected by a skilful combination of labour and judgement.\n\nIt cannot be truly affirmed, that Titian equalled the great masters of the Roman school in design; but he always took care to dispose his figures in such attitudes as showed the most beautiful parts of the body. His taste in designing men was not generally to correct or elegant as it appeared in his boys and female figures; but his colouring had all the look of real flesh, his figures breathe. He was not so bold as Giorgione, but in tenderness and delicacy he proved himself much superior to him and all other artists. The expression of the passions was not his excellence, though even in that respect many of his figures merited the justest commendation; but he always gave his figures an air of ease and dignity. His landscapes are universally allowed to be unequalled, whether we consider the forms of his trees, the grand ideas of nature which appear in his scenery, or his distances which agreeably delude and delight the eye of every observer; and they are executed with a light, tender, and mellow pencil. He learned from nature the harmony of colours, and his tints seem astonishing, not only for their force, but their sweetness; and in that respect his colouring is accounted the standard of excellence to all professors of the art.\n\nIt would prove almost an endless task to enumerate the variety of works executed by this illustrious artist, at Rome, Venice, Bologna, and Florence, as well as those which are to be seen in other cities of Italy, in England, Spain, Germany, and France; but there are two, which are mentioned as being truly admirable. One is, a Last Supper, preserved in the refectory at the Escorial in Spain, which is infinitely fine; the other is at Milan, representing Christ crowned with thorns. The principal figure in the latter has an attitude full of grace and dignity more than mortal, and the countenance shows a benevolence and humility, combined with dignity and pain, which no pencil but that of Titian could so feelingly have described. It is admirably coloured, and tenderly and delicately penciled; the heads are wonderfully beautiful, the composition excellent, and the whole has a charming effect by the chiaroscuro.\n\nHe was of so happy a constitution, that he was never ill till the year 1576, when he died of the plague, at 99 years of age. His disciples were Paulo Veronese, Giacomo Tintoret, Giacomo de Porte Bassano, and his sons.\n\nTITLARK.

Till the reign of Constantine the title of Illustrious was never given except to those who were distinguished in arms or letters: But at length it became hereditary in the families of princes, and every son of a prince was illustrious. The title of Highness was formerly given only to kings. The kings of England before the reign of Henry VIII. were addressed by the title of your Grace. That monarch first assumed the title of Highness, and afterwards that of Majesty. The title of majesty was first given him by Francis I. in their interview in 1520. Charles V. was the first king of Spain who assumed the same title.\n\nPrinces, nobles, and clergy, generally have one title derived from their territories and estates, and another derived from their rank or from some other remarkable circumstance. The pope is called the Bishop of Rome, and has the title of Holiness. A cardinal has his name generally from some church, and is saluted by the name of Eminence, or most Eminence. An archbishop, besides being named from his diocese, is called his Grace and most Reverend; a bishop is also distinguished by the name of his diocese, and has the title of his Lordship and right Reverend. Inferior clergymen are denominated Reverend.\n\nThe titles of crowned heads derived from their dominions it is unnecessary to mention. It will be sufficient to mention those by which they are addressed. To an emperor\nemperor is given the title of Imperial Majesty; to kings, that of Majesty; to the princes of Great Britain, Royal Highnesses; to those of Spain, Infant; to electors, Electoral Highnesses; to the grand duke of Tuscany, Most Serene Highness; to the other princes of Italy and Germany, Highness; to the doge of Venice, Most Serene Prince; to the grand-master of Malta, Eminence; to nuncios and ambassadors of crowned heads, Excellency; to dukes, Grace; to marquises, earls, and barons, Lordship.\n\nThe emperor of China, among his titles, takes that of Tien Su, \"Son of Heaven.\" The Orientals, it is observed, are exceedingly fond of titles: the simple governor of Schiras, for instance, after a pompous enumeration of qualities, lordships, &c., adds the titles of Flower of Courtesy, Nutmeg of Consolation, and Rose of Delight.\n\nTitle, in Law, denotes any right which a person has to the possession of a thing, or an authentic instrument whereby he can prove his right.

See Fistularia, Ichthyology Index.\n\nTobacco Pipes, Manufacture of. The art of making tobacco-pipes, or, as it is commonly called, pipe-making, though one of the simplest species of pottery, is sufficiently curious to merit description in a dictionary of arts and sciences.\n\nThe process of pipe-making may be divided into six stages; viz. 1. Beating or preparing the clay; 2. Rolling; 3. Moulding; 4. Trimming; 5. Drying; and 6. Burning.\n\nPreparation of the Clay.\u2014The fine white clay employed by the pipe-makers, is dug from the quarries in masses of about a cubic foot each. Before it can be used in the manufacture of tobacco-pipes, it must be reduced to the consistence of a tough paste. To effect this, after its outer surface has been cleared from dirt or dust, it is broken into small pieces about as large as a goose's egg, and thrown into a tub with such a quantity of soft water as experience has shown to be sufficient to bring it to the proper consistence. After lying till it has soaked up all the water, which usually requires from 12 to 24 hours, it is taken from the tub and laid on a thick strong wooden bench. Here it is beaten by a heavy four-square iron instrument, in such a manner as to cut it from one end to the other into very thin slices. It requires considerable address to perform this operation and it is surprising how thin the workmen will sometimes cut the slices, and how equally they will thus divide the clay. This beating is continued, alternately folding up the clay and slicing it, till the whole is perfectly smooth. It is then ready for rolling.\n\nRolling.\u2014The operation of rolling reduces the clay into pieces of a proper size and length for making pipes, and almost to the proper form. The roller sits at a bench with a smooth board before him, and holds in his hand another smooth board about 18 inches long, four broad, and about half an inch thick, having one end rounded off on one side, so as to produce a corresponding hollow in the clay. He now takes a piece of the beaten clay, and rolls it out, first with his hands, and then with the board, till it acquire the form of a long slender cylinder, with one end considerably larger than the rest. This large end is to form the bole, and the cylinder the shank of the future pipe. The pieces of clay thus formed are laid beside each other on a flat board, and are now ready for moulding.\n\nMoulding.\u2014This is the most complex operation, and requires the greatest number of instruments. The principal of these is the mould, which is composed of two long pieces of iron, formed so as to join together, and having their corresponding sides cut into the shape of half a tobacco pipe, each piece being hollowed so as to form half a slender cylinder, with a larger cavity at the upper end, and at such an angle as it is intended the bole of the pipe shall make with the shank. Just above that part of each side of the mould which stands beyond what is intended to form the bole, there is a notch for admitting a knife to cut off the superfluous clay. To receive the united mould there is a vice, having at one end two upright points, between which moves a long lever, and to this lever, near the points, there is loosely attached a piece of iron ending below in a smooth conical head, capable of entering the large opening of the mould, but rather smaller than that opening, so as that when forced down into it, a sufficient thickness of clay may be left between the cone and the sides of the mould, to form the bole of the pipe. One side of this vice is fixed, and the other moveable, towards the former. The moveable side has attached to it an iron screw with a very long lever as its handle, so that by turning the screw one way or the other, the moveable side of the vice may be forced nearer the fixed side, or suffered to return to its original position.\n\nBesides these principal instruments, the moulder requires a slender steel wire, fixed in a handle at one end, and having its other extremity formed into a very small head; a saucer containing wool well impregnated with oil, and a small woollen or cotton brush.\n\nWhen about to mould his pipes, he lays hold of the shank of one of the rolled pieces, and with great dexterity, which practice alone can teach, he passes up the oiled...\noiled wire through its whole length, till he finds it arrived at the commencement of the larger extremity of the clay. This extremity he then bends to the proper angle, and having oiled the inside of each part of his mould, he lays the piece of clay with the wire in it, into one part of the mould, and covers it with the other. He now puts the mould containing the clay into the vice, and with the left hand turning round the handle of the screw, so as to fix the mould firmly within the vice, he, with the right hand, presses down the lever with its conical head, and thus forms the cavity of the bole. He now withdraws the mould, cuts off with his knife the superfluous clay from the bole, opens the mould, takes out the pipe, and now only withdraws the wire. He then lays the moulded pipe on a flat board, in the same manner as the rolled pieces before described. The pipes thus moulded require to be trimmed, that is, to have the prominences arising from the joining of the mould, and other superfluous pieces of clay taken off, so as to render the surface smooth and round.\n\nTrimming.\u2014The operation of trimming is generally performed by boys and girls, as it requires very little skill. The trimmer has before him a smooth block of wood, about the length of the pipe, and of considerable thickness, elevated a little at the remote end. He has also a thick piece of smooth iron, one edge of which has across it two or more semicylindrical grooves, capable of receiving half the shank of a pipe. Taking one of the rough moulded pipes, the trimmer carefully passes up the hollow of the shank, a wire similar to that employed in moulding, and holding the pipe by the bole, while the shank lies before him on the wooden block, he pares off with a blunt knife all the excrescences of clay, both from the shank and bole, and rubs the former, while lying on the block, with the grooved part of his iron, so as to render it as smooth as possible. He now cuts off the ragged piece at the extremity of the shank, withdraws the wire, and lays the pipe on the drying frame. One great object of the trimmer is, to see that the pipe is completely perforated, which he discovers by blowing through it; and if he finds the hole choked up, he must open it by pushing the wire as far as possible. If this does not succeed, he breaks the pipe as useless.\n\nDrying.\u2014The pipe has now received all the work that can be bestowed on it by the maker, previous to its being burned; but as the exposing of it to heat, while soft and pliable, would make it crack, it is necessary that it be properly dried. For this purpose, a frame is prepared, composed of three or four long pieces of wood, fastened to two end pieces in such a manner, as that the middle of the frame shall be the lowest, to give the shanks of the pipes that curve which they generally possess. After being trimmed, the pipes are laid beside each other in this concave frame, with their boles hanging down over the edges of the frame, and their shanks bending within its hollow. In this position they are exposed to the air till they are dry and firm. They are then ready for burning or baking.\n\nBurning.\u2014For burning or baking the pipes, there is to be prepared a kiln of a simple but peculiar construction. It is built in the form of a cylinder, close at the bottom and on the sides, and open at the top. Below the bottom is a grate for receiving the fuel, and round the sides are constructed vertical or spiral flues, opening at the top, and communicating below with the grate. The sides of the furnace on its interior are pretty thin, and are formed of a cement composed of clay mixed with fresh cow dung. In the middle of the cavity is placed a pedestal composed of the same materials, for the pipes to lean against. When the pipes are sufficiently dried, they are arranged round this pedestal, resting against it, and against each other, with their boles next the bottom of the furnace. They are thus placed in successive layers, till the furnace be sufficiently full, when the open space at top is filled up with bricks placed over each other, so as to leave interstices for the free circulation of the air, and of the smoke and flame which issue through the flues. In these interstices are laid several pieces of broken dried pipes, to serve as pyrometers for ascertaining the state of the included pipes during the burning. The fire is now lighted, and kept up, till, on examining the pieces of clay laid in the interstices of the bricks, it is concluded that the pipes within the furnace are sufficiently baked. The fire is then suffered to go out, and the whole to cool till the next day, when the bricks are taken down, the pipes removed, and packed in barrels for sale.\n\nAfter being burnt, the pipes are sometimes glazed, which is done by rubbing them, while warm, with flannel and a little white wax. In some places the extremities of the shanks are rendered smooth by dipping them before burning in the ordinary potters glazing, which prevents that adhesion to the lips so unpleasant in new unglazed pipes.","sp":56,"ep":58},{"h":"TOBAGO","t":"one of the Caribbee islands, ceded to Great Britain by the treaty of Paris in 1763, taken by the French in 1781, and retaken by the British in 1793. It lies in the latitude of 11 degrees 10 minutes north, and 59 degrees 40 minutes longitude west from London, about 40 leagues south-west from Barbados, 35 south-east from St Vincent's, 20 south-east from Grenada, 12 north-east from the Spanish island of Trinidad, and between 30 and 40 north-east from the Spanish main. According to the latest accounts, it is somewhat more than 30 miles in length from north-east to south-west, between 8 and 9 in breadth, and from 23 to 25 leagues in circumference. The English visited this island very early, Sir Robert Dudley being there in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. In that of Charles I., William earl of Pembroke procured a grant of this, with two other small islands; but died before he was able to carry into execution his design of settling them. In A.D. 1632 some merchants of Zealand sent over a small colony thither, and gave it the name of New Walcheren; but before they were able thoroughly to establish themselves, they were destroyed by the Indians assisted by the Spaniards. Ten years after, James duke of Courland sent a colony thither, who settled themselves upon Great Courland bay, and made considerable progress in planting. A.D. 1654, Messieurs Adrian and Cornelius Lampius, two opulent merchants of Flushing, sent a considerable number of people thither, who settled on the other side of the island, and lived in amity with the Courlanders, until they learned that the king of Sweden had seized the person of their duke and dispossessed him of his dominions, when they attacked and forced his subjects to submit. The duke being afterwards restored, he obtained from Charles II. a grant of this island, dated the 17th of November 1664.\nIn the second Dutch war the count d'Estrees, by order of his master, totally ruined it at the close of the year 1677; and from that time it continued waste till Britain took possession of it after the treaty of Paris.\n\nThe climate, notwithstanding its vicinity to the line, is so tempered by the breezes from the sea, as to be very supportable even to Europeans; and hath the same advantages with that of Grenada, in having regular seasons, and also in being exempt from the hurricanes.\n\nThere are throughout the island many rising grounds, though except at the north-east extremity, there is no part of it that can be styled mountainous; and even there the country is far from being rugged or impassable.\n\nThe soil, if we may credit either Dutch or French writers, is as fertile and luxuriant as any of the islands, and very finely diversified. Ground provisions of all sorts have been raised in great plenty, a vast variety of vegetables, excellent in their kind, some for food, some for physic. Almost every species of useful timber is to be found here, and some of an enormous size; amongst others, the true cinnamon and nutmeg tree, as the Dutch confess, and of which none could be better judges; whole groves of salamans, and of trees that bear the true gum copal, with other odoriferous plants that render the air wholesome and pleasant. It is as well watered as can be wished, by rivers that fall into the sea on both sides, many smaller streams, and fine fresh springs in almost every part of the island. The seascape is indented by 10 or 12 fair and spacious bays, and there are amongst these one or two ports capable of receiving as large ships as ever visited those seas. There are wild hogs in great plenty, abundance of fowls of different kinds, and a vast variety of sea and river fish.\n\nAt the north-east extremity lies Little Tobago, which is two miles long, and about half a mile broad, very capable of improvement.","sp":58,"ep":59},{"h":"TOBOLSKI","t":"the capital of Siberia, is situated at the confluence of the rivers Tobol and Irtil, in N. Lat. 58\u00b0 12', E. Long. 68\u00b0 18'. The city stands upon the ascent of a high hill, the lower part of which is inhabited by Mahometan Tartars, who carry on a considerable traffic upon the river Irtil, and convey their merchandise quite across Great Tartary, as far as China.\n\nThe river Irtil is reckoned as rapid as the Danube; runs from the south, and empties itself into the Ob; the Tobol washes the other side of the town, and a little below it falls into the Irtil. By means of these two rivers, there is a constant flow of merchandise into the city during the summer season. Toboliski is therefore a great mart for the commodities of Moscow, Tartary, and other countries: and here is a great concourse of merchants. All sorts of provisions are plentiful and cheap. An hundred weight of rice is sold for 16 copecks, equal to about eightpence sterling; a sturgeon weighing 40 pounds, for half that money; an ox for two six-dollars, and every other article in proportion: the adjacent country abounds with game in great variety.\n\nThe supreme court of judicature for all Siberia is held in this city, which is also the seat of a metropolitan, sent hither from Moscow to exercise spiritual jurisdiction over the whole kingdom. Toboliski is well fortified, and defended by a strong garrison, under the command of the waiwode, who resides in the place, and takes charge of the fur tribute, which is here depoited in proper magazines. This governor enjoys a very extensive command, and can occasionally bring into the field 9000 men, besides a strong body of Tartars on horseback, to make head against the Kalmucks and Cossacks, in their repeated incursions. A sufficient number of Russians, called Jenishkars, are kept in continual pay by the government, on the banks of the Irtil, to supply travellers on the czar's account with men, boats, or carriages, to convey them as far as Surgut on the Ob, a voyage of 200 leagues by water. This is the common method of travelling in the summer; but in winter the journey by land is not half so long, being performed in sleds over the ice and snow, with which the country is covered. These sleds are moved by a pair of dogs, which will draw a load of 300 pounds with surprising expedition. They are hired at easy rates, and during one half of the year may be seen flying over the snow in great numbers. The city is supposed to contain 15,000 inhabitants. It is 800 miles east from Moscow, and 1000 from Peterburgh.\n\nTODDA PANKA. See Cycas, Botany Index.","sp":59,"ep":59},{"h":"TODDY","t":"a name given to the juice of the cocoanut tree.

There are four sorts of wine made from the same grapes, distinguished at Tokay by the names of essence, aufpruch, maflach, and the common wine. The essence is made by picking out the half-dried and shrivelled grapes, and putting them into a perforated vessel, where they remain as long as any juice runs off by the mere pressure of their own weight. This is put into small casks. The aufpruch is made by pouring the expressed juice of the grapes from which the former had been picked on those that yielded the essence, and treading them with the feet. The liquor thus obtained stands for a day or two to ferment, and then is poured into small casks, which are kept in the air for about a month, and afterwards put into casks. The same process is again repeated by the addition of more juice to the grapes which have already undergone the two former pressures, and they are now wrung with the hands; and thus is had the maflach. The fourth kind is made by taking all the grapes together at first, and submitting them to the greatest pressure: this is chiefly prepared by the peasants. The essence is thick, and very sweet and delicious; it is chiefly used to mix with the other kinds. The aufpruch is the wine commonly exported, and which is known in foreign countries by the name of Tokay.\n\nThe goodness of it is determined by the following rules. The colour should neither be reddish nor very pale, but a light silver: in trying it, the palate and tip\nTokay Wine of the tongue should be wetted without swallowing it, and if it manifest any acrimony to the tongue it is not good; but the taste ought to be soft and mild: when poured out, it should form globules in the glass, and have an oily appearance: when genuine, the strongest is always of the best quality: when swallowed, it should have an earthy astringent taste in the mouth, which is called the taste of the root. All tokay wine has an aromatic taste, which distinguishes it from every other species of wine. It keeps to any age, and improves by time: but is never good till about three years old. It is the best way to transport it in casks; for when it is on the seas, it ferments three times every season, and thus refines itself. When in bottles, there must be an empty space left between the wine and the cork, otherwise it would burst the bottle. A little oil is put upon the surface, and a piece of bladder tied over the cork. The bottles are always laid on their sides in sand. Phil. Trans. vol. xxii. part ii. p. 292, &c.\n\nTOKENS.

He studied three years at the university of Glasgow; was created master of arts in the university of Edinburgh; and afterwards completed his studies at Leyden, where he resided two years. He then went to Oxford, where, having the advantage of the public library, he collected materials upon various subjects, and composed some pieces; among which was, A Dissertation to prove the received history of the tragical death of Attilus Regulus, the Roman consul, to be a fable. He began likewise a work of greater consequence, in which he undertook to show that there are no mysteries in the Christian religion. He published it in 1696 at London, under the title of Christianity not mysterious. This book gave great offence, and was attacked by several writers. He afterward wrote in favour of the Hanoverian succession, and many other pieces. In 1707 he went into Germany, where he visited several courts; and in 1710 he was introduced to Prince Eugene, who gave him several marks of his generosity. Upon his return to England he was for some time supported by the liberality of the earl of Oxford lord-treasurer, and kept a country house at Epsom; but soon losing his lordship's favour, he published several pamphlets against that minister's measures. In the last four years of his life he lived at Putney, but used to spend most part of the winter in London. Mr Toland died at London in 1722.

It is advantageously seated on the river Tajo, which surrounds it on two sides; and on the land side, it has an ancient wall built by a Gothic king, and flanked with 100 towers. It is seated on a mountain, which renders the streets uneven, and which are narrow; but the houses are fine, and there are a great number of superb structures, besides 17 public squares, where the markets are kept.

They well knew that the stories told by their poets of their different divinities, of the rewards of Elysium, and of the punishments of Tartarus, were a collection of fables; but they had nothing better to propose to the vulgar, and they were not such strangers to the human heart, as to suppose that mankind could live together in society without being influenced in their conduct by some religion.\n\nWidely different from the genius of Paganism was the spirit of the Jewish dispensation. Truth, which is in fact always coincident with general utility, was the great object of the Mosaic law. The children of Israel were separated from the rest of the world, to preserve the knowledge and worship of the true God, at a time when all the other nations on earth, forgetting the Lord that made them, were falling prostrate to flocks and stones, and worshipping devils and impure spirits. Such was the contagion of idolatry, and so strong the propensity of the Israelites to the customs and manners of the Egyptians, and other polytheistic nations around them, that the purpose of their separation could not have been served, had not Jehovah condescended to become not only their tutelary God, but even their supreme civil Magistrate (see Theology, No. 151.) so that under the Mosaic economy, idolatry was the crime of high treason, and as such justly punished by the laws of the state. Among the Jews, the church and state were not indeed different societies. They were so thoroughly incorporated, that what was a sin in the one was a crime in the other; and the forfeiture of ecclesiastical privileges was the forfeiture of the rights of citizens.\n\nIn many respects the Christian religion is directly opposite to the ritual law of Moses. It is calculated for all nations, and intended to be propagated among all. Instead of separating one people from another, one of its principal objects is to disseminate universal benevolence, and to inculcate upon the whole human race, that mutual love which naturally springs from the knowledge that all men are brethren. Its ultimate end being to train its votaries for heaven, it concerns itself no farther with the affairs of earth than to enforce by eternal sanctions the laws of morality; and the kingdom of its Founder not being of this world, it leaves every nation at liberty to fabricate its own municipal laws, so as best to serve its own interest in the various circumstances in which it may be placed; and denounces a curse upon all who pay not to those laws the fullest obedience, when they are not obviously inconsistent with the laws of piety and virtue, which are of prior obligation. The Christian church therefore must always remain a distinct society from the state; and though, till the present age of hazardous innovations, it has been deemed expedient in every country, where the truth of the gospel is admitted, to give to the religion of Christ a legal establishment, and to confer immunities on its ministers, this measure has been adopted, not to secure the purity of the faith, which appeals to the private judgment of each individual, but merely to preserve the peace of society, and to put a restraint upon those Toleration actions of which human laws cannot take cognizance.\n\nWith religion, Christian governments have no further concern than as it tends to promote the practice of virtue. The early Christians, however, not understanding the principle upon which penal laws were employed to preserve the purity of the Jewish religion; and, as our blessed Lord observed to two of his apostles, not knowing what spirit they were of\u2014hastily concluded that they had a right to enforce the doctrines and worship of the New Testament, by the same means which had been used to preserve the Israelites steady to the doctrines and worship of the Old. Hence, though they had suffered the cruellest persecutions themselves (see Persecution), they no sooner got the power of the state in their hands, than they persecuted the Pagans for their idolatry; and afterwards, when heresies arose in the church, persecuted one another for expressing in different phrases metaphysical propositions, of such a nature as no human mind can fully comprehend. The apostle had forewarned them that there must be heresies in the church, that they who are approved may be made manifest; but it did not occur to them that perfection for opinion is the worst of all heresies, as it violates at once truth and charity.\n\nHitherto these unhallowed means of bringing Christians to uniformity of faith and practice, had been only occasionally employed, from their not accurately distinguishing between the spirit of the gospel and that of the law; but as soon as the bishops of Rome had brought the inhabitants of Europe to recognize their infallibility in explaining articles of faith and deciding points of controversy, persecution became a regular and permanent instrument of ecclesiastical discipline. To doubt or to deny any doctrine to which these warring instructors had given the sanction of their approbation, was held to be not only a refutation of the truth, but an act of rebellion against their sacred authority; and the secular power, of which, by various arts, they had acquired the absolute direction, was instantly employed to avenge both.\n\nThus Europe had been accustomed, during many centuries, to see speculative opinions propagated or defended by force; the charity and mutual forbearance which Christianity recommends, with so much warmth, were forgotten, the sacred rights of conscience and of private judgement were unheard of, and not only the idea of toleration, but even the word itself, in the sense now affixed to it, was unknown. A right to extirpate error by force, was universally allowed to be the prerogative of those who possessed the knowledge of truth; and though the first reformers did not arrogate to themselves in direct terms that infallibility which they had refused to the church of Rome, they were not less confident of the truth of their own doctrines, and required with equal ardour the princes of their party to check such as presumed to imagine or to oppose them. To this request too many of these princes lent a willing ear. I flattered at once their piety and their pride to be considered as possessing all the rights of Jewish princes; and Henry the VIII. of England, after labouring to make his divines declare that all authority ecclesiastical as well as civil flows from the crown, persecuted alternately the Papists and Protestants. Many of his successors, whose characters were much better than his, thought themselves duly authorized.\nToleration authorized, in virtue of their acknowledged supremacy over all states and conditions of men, to enforce by means of penal laws a uniformity of faith and worship among their subjects; and it was not till the revolution that any sect in England seems to have fully understood, that all men have an unalienable right to worship God in the manner which to them may seem most suitable to his nature, and the relation in which they stand to him; or that it is impossible to produce uniformity of opinion by any other means than candid disquisition and sound reasoning. That the civil magistrate has a right to check the propagation of opinions which tend only to sap the foundations of virtue, and to disturb the peace of society, cannot, we think, be questioned; but that he has no right to restrain mankind from publicly professing any system of faith, which comprehends the being and providence of God, the great laws of morality, and a future state of rewards and punishments, is as evident as that it is the object of religion to fit mankind for heaven, and the whole duty of the magistrates to maintain peace, liberty, and property, upon earth. We have elsewhere observed (see Test), that among a number of different sects of Christians, it is not the superior purity of the system of faith professed by one of them, that gives it a right to the immunities of an establishment in preference to all its rivals; but though the legislature is authorized, in certain circumstances, to make a less pure system the religion of the state, it would be the height of absurdity to suppose that any man, or body of men, can have authority to prevent a purer system from being acknowledged as the religion of individuals. For propagating opinions and pursuing practices which necessarily create civil disturbance, every man is answerable to the laws of his country; but for the soundness of his faith, and the purity of his worship, he is answerable to no tribunal but that which can search the heart.\n\nWhen churches are established, and creeds drawn up as guides to the preaching of the national clergy, it is obvious that every clergyman who teaches anything directly contrary to the doctrine of such creeds, violates the condition on which he holds his living, and may be justly deprived of that living, whether his obnoxious opinion be in itself true or false, important or unimportant; but his punishment should be extended no farther. To expel a Christian from private communion for teaching any doctrine which is neither injurious to the state nor contrary to the few simple articles which comprise the sum of the Christian faith, is the grossest tyranny; and, the governors of that church which is guilty of it, usurp the prerogative of the blest Lord, who commanded the apostles themselves not to be called masters in this sense; for one (says he) is your master (\u03c5\u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f10\u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03bb\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2), even Christ. It is indeed a hardship to deprive a man of his living for conscientiously illustrating what he believes to be a truth of the gospel, only because his illustration may be different from that which had formerly been given by men fallible like himself; but if the establishment of human compilations of faith be necessary, this hardship cannot be removed, but by making such compilations as simple as possible, and drawing them up in scripture language. Such a reformation, could it be effected peaceably, would serve other good purposes; for while it would sufficiently guard the purity of the faith, it would withdraw that temptation which too many embellishments throw in the way of men, to subscribe to the Toleration truth of what they do not really believe; and it would effectually banish from the Christian church everything which can be called by the name of persecution.

The word is formed from the Greek \u03c4\u03cd\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2, tumulus, \"sepulchre;\" or, according to Menage, from the Latin tumba, which signifies the same.\n\nIn many nations it has been customary to burn the bodies of the dead, and to collect the ashes with pious care into an urn, which was deposited in a tomb or sepulchre. See Burning. Among many nations it has also been the practice to lay the dead body in a tomb, without confining it, after having wrapped it up decently, and sometimes placing it in a coffin. See Coffin.\n\nThe tombs of the Jews were generally hollow places hewn out of a rock. Abraham buried Sarah in a cave. Such was the place too in which the kings of Judah and Israel were interred; and such was the place in which the body of our Saviour was deposited by Joseph of Arimathea. But it is probable that the common people buried their dead in graves; for our Saviour compares the Pharisees to \"graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them.\" Over the tombs, perhaps only of people of distinction, a stone or monument was erected, to intimate to passersby that they were burying places, that they might not pollute themselves by touching them. With the same intention, as Lightfoot informs us, they whitened them every year on the 15th of February.\n\nThe Egyptians also buried their dead in caves, called catacombs. See Catacomb. The pyramids, as some think, were also employed for the same purpose. Sometimes also, after embalming their dead, they placed them in niches in some magnificent apartment in their houses.\n\nThe Greeks and Romans burned their dead, and deposited their ashes in a tomb. The Greeks interred the ashes without the cities, by the sides of their highways. Sometimes indeed, by way of particular honour, they were buried in an elevated part of the town; and the Macedonians were allowed by Lycurgus to bury in the city and round their temples: But this was forbidden among the Romans by the law of the twelve tables, In urbe ne sepelio, neve urio; yet Valerius Publicola, Posthumus Tubertius, and the family of the Claudii, were buried in the Capitol. To bury by the sides of public\npublic roads was common among the Romans also; hence their epitaphs frequently began with *filius viator*. Highways were made choice of probably for two reasons: 1. That the dead might not be offensive or injure the health of the living, which they certainly would if buried in towns or populous places; and, 2dly, That they might hold out to travellers a lesson of mortality, and teach the rustic morals to die.\n\nAs it would swell this article to too great a size to describe all the different kinds of tombs which have been used by different nations and ages, we must content ourselves with shortly describing the tombs of a few nations, and adding a few concomitant circumstances.\n\nThe tombs of the Parsees are singular. The deceased, after lying a proper time in his own house, for the purpose of mourning, is carried, followed by his relations and friends, the females chanting a requiem, and deposited in a tomb of the following construction. It is a circular building, open at top, about 55 feet diameter, and 25 feet in height, filled to within 5 feet of the top, excepting a well of 15 feet diameter in the centre. The part so filled is terraced, with a slight declivity toward the well. Two circular grooves three inches deep are raised round the well; the first at the distance of four, the second at ten, feet from the well. Grooves of the like depth or height, and four feet distant from each other at the outer part of the outer circle, are carried straight from the wall to the well, communicating with the circular ones, for the purpose of carrying off the water, &c. The tomb, by this means, is divided into three circles of partitions: the outer, about seven feet by four; the middle six by three; the inner, four by two: the outer for the men, the middle for the women, the inner for the children; in which the bodies are respectively placed, wrapped loosely in a piece of cloth, and left to be devoured by the vultures; which is very soon done, as numbers of those animals are always seen hovering and watching about these charnel houses, in expectation of their prey. The friends of the deceased, or the persons who have charge of the tomb, come at the proper time, and throw the bones into their receptacle, the well in the centre; for which purpose, iron rakes and tongs are deposited in the tomb. The entrance is closed by an iron door, four feet square, on the eastern side, as high up as the terrace, to which a road is raised. Upon the wall, above the door, an additional wall is raised, to prevent people from looking into the tomb, which the Parsees are particularly careful to prevent. A Persian inscription is on a stone inserted over the door, which we once copied, but have forgotten its tenor. From the bottom of the wall subterraneous passages lead to receive the bones, &c. and prevent the well from filling.\n\nOf the ancient sepulchres found in Russia and Siberia, some are perfect tumuli, raised to an enormous height, while others are almost level with the ground. Some of them are encompassed with a square wall of large quarry stones placed in an erect position; others are covered only with a small heap of stones, or they are tumuli adorned with stones at top. Some are walled with brick within, and vaulted over; others are no more than pits or common graves. In some the earth is excavated several fathoms deep; others, and especially those which are topped by a lofty tumulus, are only dug of a sufficient depth for covering the carcase. In many of these sepulchres the bones of men, and frequently of horses, are found, and in a condition that renders it probable the bodies were not burnt before they were inhumed. Other bones show clearly that they have been previously burnt; because a part of them is unconsumed, and because they lie in a disordered manner, and some of them are wanting. Urns, in which other nations of antiquity have deposited the ashes of their dead, are never met with here. But sometimes what remained of their bodies after the combustion, and even whole carcases, are found wrapped up in thin plates of gold. Many dead bodies are frequently been deposited together in one tomb; a certain indication that either a battle had been fought in the neighbourhood of the place, or that some families buried their relations in an hereditary tomb.\n\nThe Moors, like all other Mahometans, hold it a thing irreverent, and contrary to the spirit of religion, to bury their dead in mosques, and to profane the temple of the Most High by the profanation of dead bodies. In the infancy of the church the Christians had the like piety, and gave example of the respect in which they held temples dedicated to religious worship; but ill-guided devotion, mingled with superstitious vanities, and that contagious spirit of self-interest which pervades all human affairs, without respecting the altar of God, have, together, infensibly perverted men's ideas. The burial grounds of the Mahometans are most of them without the city; the emperors have their sepulchres distinct and distant from the mosque, in sanctuaries, built by themselves, or in places which they have indicated: their tombs are exceedingly simple; the Moors do not imitate the ostentation of Europeans, where superb monuments are raised rather to gratify the pride of the living than the merit of the dead.\n\nAll Mahometans inter the dead at the hour set apart for prayer. The defunct is not kept in the house, except he expires after sunset; but the body is transported to the mosque, whither it is carried by those who are going to prayer. Each, from a spirit of devotion, is desirous to carry in his turn. The Moors sing at their burial service; which usage perhaps they have imitated after the Christians of Spain, for the oriental Mahometans do not sing. They have no particular colour appropriated to mourning; their grief for the loss of relations is a sensation of the heart they do not attempt to express by outward symbols. Women regularly go on the Friday to weep over and pray at the sepulchres of the dead, whose memory they hold dear.\n\nAmong the northern nations it was customary to bury their dead under heaps of stones called cairns, or under barrows: (See the articles CAIRNS and BARROW). The inhabitants of Tibet, it is said, neither bury nor burn their dead, but expose them on the tops of mountains. See TIBET.\n\nTOMPION; a sort of bung or cork used to stop the mouth of a cannon.

For any sound; 2. For a certain interval, as when it is said the difference between the diapente and diatessaron is a tone; 3.

See DOMINANT.\n\nTONNAGE and Poundage, an ancient duty on wine and other goods, the origin of which seems to have been this: About the 21st of Edward III., complaint was made that merchants were robbed and murdered on the seas. The king thereupon, with the consent of the peers, levied a duty of 2s. on every ton of wine, and 1\u00bdd. in the pound on all goods imported; which was treated as illegal by the commons. About 25 years after, the king, when the knights of shire were returned home, obtained a like grant from the citizens and burgesses, and the year after it was regularly granted in parliament. These duties were diminished sometimes, and sometimes increased; at length they seem to have been fixed at 3s. tonnage and 1s. poundage. They were at first usually granted only for a stated term of years, as, for two years in Ric. II.; but in Henry VI.'s time they were granted him for life by a statute in the 31st year of his reign; and again to Edward IV. for the term of his life also: since which time they were regularly granted to all his successors for life, sometimes at the first, sometimes at other subsequent parliaments, till the reign of Charles I.; when, as the noble historian expresses it, his ministers were not sufficiently solicitous for a renewal of his legal grant. And yet these imposts were imprudently and unconstitutionally levied and taken, without consent of parliament, for 15 years together; which was one of the causes of those unhappy discontented, justifiable at first in too many instances, but which degenerated at last into causeless rebellion and murder. For, as in every other, so in this particular case, the king (previous to the commencement of hostilities) gave the nation ample satisfaction for the errors of his former conduct, by passing an act, whereby he renounced all power in the crown of Tonnage, levying the duty of tonnage and poundage, without the Tonquin's express consent of parliament; and also all power of imposition upon any merchandises whatever. Upon the restoration this duty was granted to King Charles II. for life, and so it was to his two immediate successors; but now, by three several statutes, 9 Ann. c. 6. 1 Geo. I. c. 12. and 3 Geo. I. c. 7. it is made perpetual, and mortgaged for the debt of the public.","sp":64,"ep":64},{"h":"TONQUIN","t":"a kingdom of Asia, in the East Indies, beyond the Ganges; bounded on the north by the province of Yunnan in China, on the east by the province of Canton and the bay of Tonquin, on the south by Cochin China, and on the west by the kingdom of Laos. It is about 1200 miles in length and 500 in breadth; and is one of the finest and most considerable kingdoms of the East, as well on account of the number of inhabitants as the riches it contains and the trade it carries on. The country is thick set with villages; and the natives in general are of a middle stature and clean limbed, with a tawny complexion. Their faces are oval and flat, and their noses and lips well proportioned. Their hair is black, long, lank, and coarse; and they let it hang down their shoulders. They are generally dexterous, nimble, active, and ingenious in mechanic arts. They weave a multitude of fine silks, and make curious lacquer-works, which are transported to other countries. There is such a number of people, that many want employment; for they seldom go to work but when foreign ships arrive. The money and goods brought hither by the English and Dutch put them in action; for they have not money of their own sufficient to employ themselves; and therefore one-third at least must be advanced beforehand by the merchants; and the ships must stay here till the goods are finished, which is generally five or six months. They are so addicted to gaming, that when everything else is lost, they will stake their wives and children. The garments of the Tonquinese are made either of silk or cotton; but the poor people and soldiers wear only cotton of a dark tawny colour. Their houses are small and low; and the walls either of mud, or hurdles daubed over with clay. They have only a ground floor, with two or three partitions; and each room has a square hole to let in the light. The villages consist of 30 or 40 houses, surrounded with trees; and in some places there are banks to keep the water from overflowing their gardens, where they have oranges, betels, melons, and salad-herbs. In the rainy season they cannot pass from one house to another without wading through the water; they sometimes have boats. In the capital city called Caicho there are about 20,000 houses with mud-walls, and covered with thatch; a few are built with brick, and roofed with pan-tiles. In each yard is a small arched building like an oven, about six feet high, made of brick, which serves to secure their goods in case of fire. The principal streets are very wide, and paved with small stones. The king of Tonquin has three palaces in it, such as they are; and near them are stables for his horses and elephants. The house of the English factory is seated at the north end of the city, fronting the river, and is the best in the city. The people in general are courteous, and civil to strangers; but the great men are proud, haughty, and ambitious; the soldiers insolent, and the poor thieves. They buy all their\ntheir wives, of which the great men have several; but the poor are flinted for want of money. In hard times the men will sell both their wives and children to buy rice to maintain themselves. The women offer themselves to strangers as wives while they stay, and agree with them for a certain price. Even the great men will offer their daughters to the merchants and officers who are likely to stay six months in the country. They are not afraid of being with child; for if they are girls they can sell them well when they are young, because they are fairer than the other inhabitants. These women are said to be very faithful; and are treated with money and goods by the Europeans during their absence, and will make great advantage with them. The first new moon in the year that happens after the middle of January, is a great festival; when they rejoice for 10 or 12 days together, and spend their time in all manner of sports. Their common drink is tea, but they make themselves merry with arrack. The language is spoken very much in the throat; and some of the words are pronounced through the teeth, and has a great resemblance to the Chinese. They have several mechanic arts or trades; such as smiths, carpenters, joiners, turners, weavers, tailors, potters, painters, money-changers, paper-makers, workers in lacquer, and bell-founders.\u2014Their commodities are gold, mukl, silks, calicoes, drugs of many sorts, woods for dyeing, lacquered wares, earthen wares, salt, aniseeds, and worm-seeds. The lacquered ware is not inferior to that of Japan, which is accounted the best in the world. With all these merchandises, one would expect the people to be very rich, but they are in general very poor; the chief trade being carried on by the Chinese, English, and Dutch. The goods imported, besides silver, are saltpetre, sulphur, English broad-cloth, pepper, spices, and great guns.\n\nTONSILS.

But the Romans have carried the affair of tonsure much farther; the candidate for it kneeling before the bishop, who cuts the hair in five different parts of the head, viz. before, behind, on each side, and on the crown.","sp":65,"ep":65},{"h":"TONTINE","t":"a loan given for life annuities with benefit of survivorship; so called from the inventor Laurence Tonti, a Neapolitan. He proposed his scheme in 1653 to reconcile the people to Cardinal Mazarine's government, by amusing them with the hope of becoming suddenly rich. He obtained the consent of the court, but the parliament would not register the edict. He made attempts afterwards, but without success.\n\nIt was not till Louis XIV. was distressed by the league of Augsburg, and by his own immense expenses, that he had recourse to the plans of Tonti, which, though long laid aside, were not forgotten. By an edict in 1689 he created a Tontine royale of 1,400,000 livres annual rent, divided into 14 clafs. The actions were 300 livres a piece, and the proprietors were to receive 10 per cent. with benefit of survivorship in every claf. This scheme was executed but very imperfectly; for none of the clafs rose to above 25,000 livres, instead of 100,000, according to the original institution; though the annuities were very regularly paid. A few years after, the people seeming in better humour for projects of this kind, another tontine was erected upon nearly the same terms, but this was never above half full. They both subsided in the year 1726, when the French king united the 13th claf of the first tontine with the 14th of the second; all the actions of which were polled by Charlotte Bonnemay, widow of Lewis Barbiere, a surgeon of Paris, who died at the age of 96. This gentlewoman had ventured 300 livres in each tontine; and in the last year of her life she had for her annuity 73,500 livres, or about 3600l. a-year, for about 30l.\n\nThe nature of the tontine is this; there is an annuity, after a certain rate of interest, granted to a number of people; divided into clafs, according to their respective ages; so that annually the whole fund of each claf is divided among the survivors of that claf; till at last it falls to one, and upon the extinction of that life, reverts to the power by which the tontine was erected, and which becomes thereby security for the due payment of the annuities.","sp":65,"ep":65},{"h":"TOOL","t":"among mechanics, denotes in general any instrument used for making other complex instruments and machines, or in other operations of the mechanic arts.","sp":65,"ep":65},{"h":"TOOTH","t":"for a description of, see ANATOMY, No 27.\n\nTOOTHACH.

His partisans, to be even with the republicans, gave them the name of Whigs, from a word which signifies why, in derision of their poor fare. The Tories, or cavaliers, as they were also called, had then principally in view the political interest of the king, the crown, and the church of England; and the round-heads, or Whigs, proposed chiefly the maintaining of the rights and interests of the people, and of Protestantism. This is the most popular account; and yet it is certain the names Whig and Tory were but little known till about the middle of the reign of King Charles II. M. de Cize relates, that it was in the year 1678 that the whole nation was first observed to be divided into Whigs and Tories; and that on occasion of the famous deposition of Titus Oates, who accused the Catholics of having conspired against the king and the state, the appellation of Whig was given to such as believed the plot real; and Tory to those who held it fictitious.\n\nThese parties may be considered either with regard to the state or to religion. The state Tories are either violent or moderate: the first would have the king to be absolute, and therefore plead for passive obedience, non-resistance, and the hereditary right of the house of Stuart. The moderate Tories would not suffer the king to lose any of his prerogative; but then they would not sacrifice those of the people. The state Whigs are either strong republicans or moderate ones. The first (says Rapin) are the remains of the party of the long parliament, who attempted to change monarchy to a commonwealth: but these make to slender a figure, that they only served to strengthen the party of other Whigs. The Tories would persuade the world, that all the Whigs are of this kind; as the Whigs would make us believe that all the Tories are violent. The moderate state Whigs are much in the same sentiments with the moderate Tories, and desire that the government may be maintained on the ancient foundation: all the difference is, that the first bear a little more to the parliament and people, and the latter to that of the king. In short, the old Whigs were always jealous of the encroachments of the royal prerogative, and watchful over the preservation of the liberties and properties of the people.","sp":66,"ep":66},{"h":"TORMENTILLA","t":"Tormentil, a genus of plants belonging to the clas of icelandica, and in the natural system ranging under the 35th order, Senticoceae.

Mr Cateby observes, that the hard strong covering which includes all sorts of tortoises, is very improperly called a shell; being of a perfect bony contexture; but covered on the outside with scales, or rather plates, of a horny substance; which are what the workmen call tortoise-shell.\n\nThere are two general kinds of tortoises, viz. the land and sea tortoise, testudo terraeiris and marina. The sea-tortoise, again, is of several kinds; but it is the caret, or testudo imbricata of Linnaeus, alone which furnishes that beautiful shell so much admired in Europe.\n\nThe shell of the caretta, or hawksbill tortoise, is thick; and consists of two parts, the upper, which covers the back, and the lower the belly: the two are joined together at the sides by strong ligaments, which yet allow of a little motion. In the front-part is an aperture for the head and fore-legs, and behind for the hind-legs and tail. It is the under shell alone that is used: to separate it, they make a little fire beneath it, and as soon as ever it is warm, the under shell becomes easily separable with a point of a knife, and is taken off in laminae or leaves.\n\nThe whole spoils of the caret consist in 13 leaves or scales, eight of them flat, and five a little bent. Of the flat ones, there are four large ones, sometimes a foot long, and seven inches broad. The best tortoise-shell is thick, clear, transparent, of the colour of antimony, sprinkled with brown and white. When used in marquetry, &c. the workmen give it what colour they please by means of coloured leaves, which they put underneath it.\n\nWorking and joining of Tortoise-shell.\u2014Tortoise-shell and horn become soft in a moderate heat, as that of boiling water, so as to be pressed, in a mould, into any form, the shell or horn being previously cut into plates of a proper size. Plumer informs us, in his Art de Tourner, that two plates are likewise united into one by heating and pressing them; the edges being thoroughly cleaned, and made to fit close to one another. The tortoise-shell is conveniently heated for this purpose by applying a hot iron above and beneath the juncture, with the interposition of a wet cloth to prevent the shell from being scorched by the irons: these irons should be pretty thick, that they may not lose their heat before the union is effected. Both tortoise-shell and horns may be stained of a variety of colours, by means of the colouring drugs commonly used in dying, and by certain metallic solutions.","sp":67,"ep":67},{"h":"TORTURE","t":"a violent pain inflicted on persons to force them to confess the crimes laid to their charge, or as a punishment for crimes committed.\n\nTorture was never permitted among the Romans except in the examination of slaves: it would therefore appear, that it was a general opinion among them, that a slave had such a tendency to falsehood, that the truth could only be extorted from him. To the disgrace of the professors of Christianity, torture was long practised. Torture by those who called themselves Catholics, against those whom they termed heretics; that is, those who differed in opinion from themselves. Finding that they could not bring over others to adopt their sentiments by the force of argument, they judged it proper to compel them by the force of punishment. This practice was very general among orthodox Christians, but especially among Roman Catholics. See Inquisition.\n\nBy the law of England, torture was at one period employed to compel those criminals who stood obstinately mute when brought to trial, and refused either to plead guilty or not guilty; but it is now abolished (see Arraignment, and Rack).

In order to find out the purity or quantity of base metal in these various admixtures, when they are to be examined they are compared with these needles, which are mixed in a known proportion, and prepared for this use. The metals of these needles, both pure and mixed, are all made into laminae or plates, one-twelfth of an inch broad, and of a fourth part of their breadth in thickness, and an inch and half-long; these being thus prepared, you are to engrave on each a mark indicating its purity, or the nature and quantity of the admixture in it. The black rough marbles, the basaltes, or the softer kinds of black pebbles, are the most proper for touch-lines.\n\nThe method of using the needles and stone is thus: The piece of metal to be tried ought first to be wiped well with a clean towel or piece of soft leather, that you may the better see its true colour; for from this alone an experienced person, will in some degree, judge beforehand what the principal metal is, and how and with what debased.\n\nThen choose a convenient, not over large, part of the surface of the metal, and rub it several times very hardly and strongly against the touchstone, that in case a deceitful coat or crust should have been laid upon it, it may be worn off by that friction: this, however, is more readily done by a grindstone or small file. Then wipe a flat and very clear part of the touchstone, and rub against it, over and over, the just mentioned part of the surface of the piece of metal, till you have, on the flat surface of the stone, a thin metallic crust, an inch long, and about an eighth of an inch broad: this done, look out the needle that seems most like to the metal under trial, wipe the lower part of this needle:\nvery clean, and then rub it against the touchstone, as you did the metal, by the side of the other line, and in a direction parallel to it.\n\nWhen this is done, if you find no difference between the colours of the two marks made by your needle and the metal under trial, you may with great probability pronounce that metal and your needle to be of the same alloy, which is immediately known by the mark engraved on your needle. But if you find a difference between the colour of the mark given by the metal, and that by the needle you have tried, choose another needle, either of a darker or lighter colour than the former, as the difference of the tinge on the touchstone directs; and by one or more trials of this kind you will be able to determine which of your needles the metal answers, and thence what alloy it is of, by the mark of the needle; or else you will find that the alloy is extraordinary, and not to be determined by the comparison of your needles.","sp":67,"ep":68},{"h":"TOUCHSTONE","t":"a black, smooth, glossy stone, used to examine the purity of metals.

It is a very ancient place, having been founded, according to the common opinion, by a Roman general. It is the chief town of the department, and before the great revolution in 1789 was an episcopal see. The inhabitants are computed at 80,000. It is divided into the Old Quarter and the New Quarter. The first, which is very ill built, has nothing remarkable in it but the Rue aux Arbres, the Tree-Street, which is a kind of course or mall, and the town-house; the gate of this is surrounded by a balcony, which is supported by two termini, the masterpieces of the famous Puget. The New Quarter, which forms as it were a second city, contains beside the magnificent works constructed in the reign of Louis XIV., many fine houses (among which that of the late seminary merits beyond comparison the preference) and a grand oblong square, lined with trees, and serving as a parade.\n\nThe Merchants Haven, along which extends a noble quay, on which stands the town-house, is protected by two moles, begun by Henry IV. The New Haven was constructed by Louis XIV., as were the fortifications of the city. In the front of this haven is an arsenal, containing all the places necessary for the construction and fitting out of vessels: the first object that appears is a rope-walk, entirely arched, extending as far as the eye can reach, and built after the designs of Vauban: here cables are made, and above is a place for the preparation of hemp. Here likewise is the armory for muskets, pistols, halberds, &c. In the park of artillery are cannon placed in piles, bombs, grenades, mortars, and balls of various kinds, ranged in wonderful order. The long sail-room, the foundry for cannon, the dockyards, the bafons, &c. are all worthy of observation.\n\nBoth the Old and New Port have an outlet into the spacious outer road or harbour, which is surrounded by hills, and formed by nature almost circular. Its circuit is of very great extent, and the entrance is defended on both sides by a fort with strong batteries. In a word, the bafons, docks, and arsenal, at Toulon, warranted the remark of a foreigner that visited them in the late reign, that \"the king of France was greater there than at Versailles.\" Toulon is the only mart in the Mediterranean for the re-exportation of the products of the East Indies.\n\nThis place was destroyed toward the end of the tenth century, and pillaged by the African pirates almost as soon as rebuilt. The constable of Bourbon, at the head of the Imperial troops, obtained possession of it in 1524, as did Charles V. in 1536; but in the next century Charles Emanuel duke of Savoy could not enter it, and Prince Eugene in 1707 ineffectually laid siege to it. This city was surrendered by the inhabitants in September 1793 to the British admiral Lord Hood, as a condition and means of enabling them to effect the re-establishment of monarchy in France, according to the constitution of 1789. Lord Hood accordingly, in conjunction with the Spanish land and naval forces, took possession of the harbour and forts in trust for Louis XVII. It was garrisoned for some time by the British troops, and their allies the Spaniards, Neapolitans, and Sardinians; but the French having laid siege to it, the garrison was obliged to evacuate the place in the month of December following, after having destroyed the grand arsenal, two ships of 84 guns, eight of 74, and two frigates; and carried off the Commerce de Marseilles, a ship of 120 guns, with an 80 and 74 gun ship. This exploit was most gallantly performed, after it was found impossible to defend the town, or to carry off the ships. Lord Hood entrusted the management of the affair to Sir Sydney Smith, so distinguished for his intrepidity. Captain Hare commanded the fireship which was towed into the grand arsenal; and so eager was he to execute his orders, that instead of setting fire to the train in the usual cautious manner, he fired a pistol loaded with powder into the bowl of the train, composed of 36 pounds of powder, and other combustibles. The consequence was, he was blown into the water with such violence, as to knock a lieutenant of the Victory's boat overboard, and narrowly escaped with his life. A Spanish captain was appointed to set fire to the small arsenal, but cowardice prevented him from executing his orders; and this is the reason why the whole French ships were not destroyed. We have been favoured with this account by an officer of the British fleet.\n\nToulon is seated on a bay of the Mediterranean, 17 leagues south-east of Aix, 15 south-east of Marseilles, and 217 south-east of Paris.

It is the most considerable city in France next to Paris and Lyons, although its population bears no proportion to its extent. According to Mr Neckar's calculation, it contains 56,000 inhabitants. The streets are very handsome,\nToulouse, some, and the walls of the city, as well as the houses, are built with bricks. The town-house, a modern structure, forms a perfect square, 324 feet long and 66 high. The principal front occupies an entire side of the grand square, lately called the Place Royale. In the great hall, called the Hall of Illustrious Men, is the statue of the Chevalier d'Aucre, and the busts of all the great men to whom Toulouse has given birth. Communicating with the ocean on one side by the river Garonne, and with the Mediterranean on the other by the canal of Languedoc, Toulouse might have been a great commercial city; but the taste of the inhabitants has been directed to the sciences and belles-lettres. Of course, there are two colleges, two public libraries, and three academies. The little commerce of Toulouse consists in leather, drapery, blankets, mignionets, oil, iron, mercery, hardware, and books. The bridge over the Garonne is at least equal to those of Tours and Orleans; it forms the communication between the suburb of St Cyprian and the city. The quays extend along the banks of the Garonne; and it has been in contemplation to line them with new and uniform houses. Toulouse is 37 miles east of Auch, 125 south-east of Bordeaux, and 350 south-west of Paris. E. Long. 1\u00b0 27', N.

He made his first campaigns in Holland, under Maurice and Frederic Henry princes of Orange; who were his uncles by the mother's side; and even then distinguished himself by his bravery. In 1634 he marched with his regiment into Lorraine; and having contributed to the taking of La Mothe, was, though very young, made marshal of camp. In 1636 he took Saarwerne, and the year following the castles of Hirtz and Sole; on which occasion he performed an action like that of Scipio's, with respect to a very beautiful woman whom he sent back to her husband. The viscount Turenne continued to distinguish himself in several sieges and battles, and in 1644 was made marshal of France; but had the misfortune to be defeated at the battle of Mariendal in 1645. However, he gained the battle of Nortlingen three months after; restored the elector of Treves to his dominions; and the following year made the famous junction of the French army with that of Sweden commanded by General Wrangel, which obliged the duke of Bavaria to demand a peace. Afterwards that duke breaking the treaty he had concluded with France, he was defeated by the viscount Turenne at the battle of Zumarflaufen, and in 1648 driven entirely out of his dominions. During the civil wars in France he sided with the princes, and was defeated at the battle of Rhetel in 1650; but soon after was restored to the favour of the king, who in 1652 gave him the command of his army. He acquired great honour at the battles of Jergeau, Gren, and the suburbs of St Anthony, and by the retreat he made before the army commanded by the princes at Ville Neuve St George. In 1654 he made the Spaniards raise the siege of Arras; the next year he took Conde, St Guilian, and several other places; gained the famous battle of Dunes; and made himself master of Dunkirk, Oudenarde, and almost all Flanders: this obliged the Spaniards to conclude the peace of the Pyrenees in 1660. These important services occasioned his being made marshal-general of the king's camps and armies. The war being renewed with Spain in 1667, Turenne commanded in Flanders; and took so many places, that in 1668 the Spaniards were obliged to sue for peace. He commanded the French army in the war against the Dutch in 1672; took 40 towns in 22 days; pursued the elector of Brandenburg even to Berlin; gained the battles of Slintheim, Ladenburg, Enheim, Muthhausen, and Turkeim; and obliged the Imperial army, which consisted of 70,000 men, to repass the Rhine. By this campaign the viscount Turenne acquired immortal honour. He passed the Rhine to give battle to General Montecucculi, whom he followed as far as Safpach; but mounting upon an eminence to discover the enemy's camp, he was killed by a cannon-ball in 1675.

It is derived from the French word tourner, i.e., \"to turn round,\" because to be expert in these exercises, much agility both of horse and man was requisite, they riding round a ring in imitation of the ancient Circe.\n\nThe first tournaments were only courses on horseback, wherein the cavaliers tilted at each other with canes in manner of lances; and were distinguished from jousts, which were courses or careers, accompanied with attacks and combats, with blunted lances and swords. See Joust.\n\nThe prince who published the tournament, used to lend a king at arms, with a safe-conduct, and a sword, to all the princes, knights, &c. signifying that he intended a tournament and clashing of swords, in the presence of ladies and damels; which was the usual formula of invitation.\n\nThey first engaged man against man, and then troop against troop; and after the combat, the judges allotted the prize to the best cavalier, and the best striker of swords; who was accordingly conducted in pomp to the lady of the tournament; where, after thanking her very reverently, he saluted her and likewise her two attendants.\n\nThese tournaments made the principal diversion of the 13th and 14th centuries. Munster says, it was Henry the Fowler, duke of Saxony, and afterwards emperor, who died in 936, that first introduced them; but it appears from the chronicle of Tours, that the true inventor of this famous sport, at least in France, was one Geoffrey, lord of Preuilly, about the year 1066.\n\nInstances of them occur among the English in the reign\nreign of King Stephen, about the year 1140; but they were not much in use till Richard's time, towards the year 1149. After which period these diversions were performed with extraordinary magnificence in the Tilt-yard near St James's, Smithfield, and other places.\n\nThe following is the account of a tournament, from Mailand. King Richard II. desiring to hold a tournament at London on the Sunday after Michaelmas, sent divers heralds to make proclamations of it in all the principal courts of Europe; and accordingly not a few princes, and great numbers of the prime nobility, reported hither from France, Germany, the Netherlands, &c. This solemnity began on Sunday afternoon, from the Tower of London, with a pompous cavalcade of 60 ladies, each leading an armed knight by a silver chain, being attended by their \"quires of honour,\" and, passing through Cheapside, rode to Smithfield, where the jousts and tournaments continued several days with magnificent variety of entertainments; on which occasion the king kept open house at the bishop of London's palace for all persons of distinction, and every night concluded with a ball.\n\nAt last, however, they were found to be productive of bad effects, and the occasions of several fatal misfortunes\u2014as in the instance of Henry II. of France, and of the tilt exhibited at Chalons, which, from the numbers killed on both sides, was called the little war of Chalons.

He wandered over the mountains of Dauphiny, Savoy, Catalonia, the Pyrenees, and the Alps, in search of new species of plants, which he acquired with much fatigue and danger.

Since the year 1789 provincial halfpence have been made and circulated in considerable quantity. As ancient medals and coins have been frequently of use to historians, it is to be regretted that many of these provincial halfpence are rendered useless in this respect by unmeaning figures and puerile devices. Utility and elegance ought to be studied; for this view it has been proposed by a gentleman of taste on this subject, that all coins should be distinguished by one of the following five characteristics. 1. Fac similes of magnificent beautiful buildings. 2. Representations of great and useful undertakings. 3. Emblems of the industry and commerce of the age. 4.

Its length from north to south is upwards of 120 miles, and its breadth about 80. It is full of mountains, and produces little corn, but plenty of wine, fruits of several sorts, and abundance of game.\n\n**TRANSACTIONS,** a name generally given to a collection of the papers read before literary or philosophical societies. The name of Philosophical Transactions was first adopted by the Royal Society of London.\n\nThe Philosophical Transactions to the end of the year 1700 were abridged in three volumes by Mr John Lowthorp: those from the year 1700 to 1720 were abridged in two volumes by Mr Henry Jones: those from 1719 to 1733 were abridged in two volumes by Mr John Eames and Mr John Martyn; Mr Martyn continued the abridgement of those from 1732 to 1744 in two volumes, and of those from 1743 to 1750 in two volumes.\n\nThey were for many years published in numbers, and the printing of them was always, from time to time, the single act of the respective secretaries, till the year 1752, when the society thought fit that a committee should be appointed to reconsider the papers read before them, and to select out of them such as they should judge most proper for publication in the future Transactions. They are published annually in two parts at the expense of the society, and each fellow is entitled to receive one copy gratis of every volume published after his admission into the society.\n\nThey were first set on foot in 1665, by Mr Oldenburg, secretary of the society, and were continued by him till the year 1677. Upon his death, they were discontinued till January 1678, when Dr Grew resumed the publication of them, and continued it for the months of December 1678, and January and February 1679, after which they were intermitted till January 1683. During this last interval they were supplied in some measure by Dr Hooke's Philosophical Collections. They were also interrupted for three years, from December 1687 to January 1691, beside other smaller interruptions amounting to near one year and a half more, before October 1695, since which time the Transactions have been regularly carried on.\n\n**TRANSCENDENTAL,** or **TRANSCENDENT,** something elevated, or raised above other things; which passes and transcends the nature of other inferior things.\n\n**TRANSCRIPT,** a copy of any original writing, particularly that of an act or instrument inserted in the body of another.\n\n**TRANSFER,** in commerce, an act whereby a person surrenders his right, interest, or property, in anything moveable or immoveable to another.\n\n**TRANSFORMATION,** in general, denotes a change of form, or the assuming a new form different from a former one.\n\n**TRANSFUSION,** the act of pouring a liquor out of one vessel into another.\n\n**TRANSFUSION of Blood,** an operation by which it was some time ago imagined that the age of animals would be renewed, and immortality, or the next thing to it, conferred on those who had undergone it.\n\nThe method of transfusing Dr Lower gives us to the following effect: take up the carotid artery of the dog, or other animal, whose blood is to be transfused into another of the same, or a different kind; separate it from the nerve of the eighth pair, and lay it bare above...\nTransfusion\u2014an inch. Make a strong ligature on the upper part of the artery; and an inch nearer the heart another ligature with a running knot, to be loosened and fastened as occasion requires. Draw two threads between the two ligatures, open the artery, put in a quill, and tie up the artery again upon the quill by the two threads, and stop the quill by a stick.\n\nThen make bare the jugular vein of the other animal for about an inch and a half in length, and at each end make a ligature with a running knot; and in the space between the two knots draw under the veins two threads, as in the other. Open the vein, and put into it two quills, one into the defending part of the vein, to receive the blood from the other dog, and carry it to the heart; the other quill put into the other part of the jugular, towards the head, through which the second animal's own blood is to run into ditches. The quills thus tied fast, stop them up with sticks till there be occasion to open them.\n\nThings thus disposed, fasten the dogs on their sides towards one another, in such manner as that the quills may go into each other; then unstop the quill that goes down into the second dog's jugular vein, as also that coming out of the other dog's artery; and by the help of two or three other quills put into each other, as there shall be occasion, insert them into one another. Then slip the running knots, and immediately the blood runs through the quills as through an artery, very impetuously. As the blood runs into the dog, unstop the quill in the upper part of his jugular, for his own blood to run out at, though not constantly, but as you perceive him able to bear it, till the other dog begins to cry and faint, and at last die. Lastly, Take both quills out of the jugular, tie the running knot fast, and cut the vein afraiden, and sew up the skin: the dog, thus dismiffed, will run away as if nothing ailed him.\n\nIn the Philosophical Transactions we have accounts of the success of various transfusions practised at London, Paris, in Italy, &c. Sir Edmund King transfused forty-nine ounces of blood out of a calf into a sheep; the sheep, after the operation, appearing as well and as strong as before.\n\nM. Denis transfused the blood of three calves into three dogs, which all continued brisk, and ate as well as before. The same person transfused the blood of four wethers into a horse twenty-five years old, which thence received much strength, and a more than ordinary appetite.\n\nSoon after this operation was introduced at Paris, viz. in 1667 and 1668, M. Denis performed it on five human subjects, two of whom recovered of disorders under which they laboured, one being in perfect health suffered no inconvenience from it; and two persons who were ill, and submitted to the operation, died; in consequence of which the magistrates issued a sentence, prohibiting the transfusion on human bodies under pain of imprisonment.\n\nMr John Hunter, we are told, made many ingenious experiments to determine the effects of transfusing blood, some of which are sufficient to attract attention. But whether such experiments can ever be made with safety on the human body, is a point not easily determined. They might be allowed in desperate cases proceeding from a corruption of the blood, from poison, &c. as in hydrophobia.","sp":70,"ep":72},{"h":"TRANSITION","t":"the passage of anything from one place to another.","sp":72,"ep":72},{"h":"TRANSITION","t":"in Oratory.

There is a curious instance of an increase of transparency in rubbing a piece of white paper over one that has been written upon or printed: while the white paper is at rest, the writing or print will perhaps scarcely appear through it; but when in motion, will be very easily legible, and continue so till the motion is discontinued.\n\nTransposition, in Grammar, a disturbing or dislocating the words of a discourse, or a changing their natural order of construction, to please the ear by rendering the contexture more smooth, easy, and harmonious.\n\nTransubstantiation, in Theology, the conversion or change of the substance of the bread and wine in the eucharist, into the body and blood of Jesus Christ; which the Romish church suppose to be wrought by the consecration of the priest.

It is surrounded on all parts by high mountains, which, however, are not barren. The inhabitants have as much corn and wine as they want themselves; and there are rich mines of gold, silver, lead, copper, quicksilver, and alum. It has undergone various revolutions; but it now belongs to the house of Austria. The inhabitants are of several sorts of religions; as Papists, Lutherans, Calvinists, Socinians, Photinians, Arians, Greeks, and Mahometans. It is about 162 miles in length, and 150 in breadth. The administration of affairs is conducted by 12 persons; namely, three Roman Catholics, three Lutherans, three Calvinists, and three Socinians. The militia is commanded by the governor, whose commission is the more important, as Transylvania is the bulwark of Christendom.

See Clypeola, Botany Index.\n\nTreason, a general appellation, made use of by the law, to denote not only offences against the king and government, but also that accumulation of guilt which arises whenever a superior reposes a confidence in a subject or inferior, between whom and himself there subsists a natural, a civil, or even a spiritual relation; and the inferior so abuses that confidence, so forgets the obligations of duty, subjection, and allegiance, as to destroy the life of any such superior or lord. Hence treason is of two kinds, high and petty.\n\nHigh Treason, or Treason Paramount (which is equivalent to the crimen laesae maiestatis of the Romans, as Glanvil denominates it also in our English law), is an offence committed against the security of the king or kingdom, whether by imagination, word, or deed. In order to prevent the inconveniences which arose in England from a multitude of constructive treasons, the statute 25 Edw. III, c. 2, was made; which defines what offences only for the future should be held to be treason; and this statute comprehends all kinds of high-treason under seven distinct branches.\n\n\"1. When a man doth compass or imagine the death of our lord the king, of our lady his queen, or of their eldest son and heir.\" Under this description it is held that a queen-regnant (such as Queen Elizabeth)\nQueen Anne) is within the words of the act, being invested with royal power, and intitled to the allegiance of her subjects: but the husband of such a queen is not comprised within these words; and therefore no treason can be committed against him.\n\nLet us next see what is a compassing or imagining the death of the king, &c. These are synonymous terms: the word compass signifying the purpose or design of the mind or will; and not, as in common speech, the carrying such design to effect. And therefore an accidental stroke, which may mortally wound the sovereign, per infortunium, without any traitorous intent, is no treason: as was the case of Sir Walter Tyrell, who, by the command of King William Rufus, shooting at a hart, the arrow glanced against a tree, and killed the king upon the spot. But as this compassing or imagination is an act of the mind, it cannot possibly fall under any judicial cognizance, unless it be demonstrated by some open or overt act. The statute expressly requires, that the accused \"be thereof upon sufficient proof attainted of some open act by men of his own condition.\" Thus, to provide weapons or ammunition for the purpose of killing the king, is held to be a palpable overt act of treason in imagining his death. To conspire to imprison the king by force, and move towards it by assembling company, is an overt act of compassing the king's death; for all force used to the person of the king, in its consequence may tend to his death, and is a strong presumption of something worse intended than the present force, by such as have so far thrown off their bounden duty to their sovereign: it being an old observation, that there is generally but a short interval between the prisons and the graves of princes. It seems clearly to be agreed, that by the common law and the statute of Edw. III., words spoken amount only to a high misdemeanor, and no treason. For they may be spoken in heat, without any intention; or be mistaken, perverted, or misremembered by the hearers; their meaning depends always on their connection with other words and things; they may signify differently even according to the tone of voice with which they are delivered; and sometimes silence itself is more expressive than any discourse. As therefore there can be nothing more equivocal and ambiguous than words, it would indeed be unreasonable to make them amount to high treason. And accordingly, in 4 Car. I. on a reference to all the judges, concerning some very atrocious words spoken by one Pyne, they certified to the king, \"that though the words were as wicked as might be, yet they were no treason; for unless it be by some particular statute, no words will be treason.\" If the words be set down in writing, it argues more deliberate intention; and it has been held, that writing is an overt act of treason; for scribere est agere. But even in this case the bare words are not the treason, but the deliberate act of writing them.\n\n2. The second species of treason is, \"if a man do violate the king's companion, or the king's eldest daughter unmarried, or the wife of the king's eldest son and heir.\" By the king's companion is meant his wife; and by violation is understood carnal knowledge, as well without force as with it: and this is high treason in both parties if both be consenting; as some of the wives of Henry VIII. by fatal experience evinced.\n\n3. The third species of treason is, \"if a man do levy war against our lord the king in his realm.\" And this may be done by taking arms, not only to dethrone the king, but under pretence to reform religion, or the laws, or to remove evil counsellors, or other grievances whether real or pretended. For the law does not, neither can it, permit any private man, or set of men, to interfere forcibly in matters of such high importance; especially as it has established a sufficient power for these purposes in the high court of parliament: neither does the constitution justify any private, or particular resistance for private or particular grievances; though, in cases of national oppression, the nation has very justifiably risen as one man, to vindicate the original contract subsisting between the king and his people.\n\n4. \"If a man be adherent to the king's enemies in his realm, giving to them aid and comfort in the realm or elsewhere,\" he is also declared guilty of high treason. This must likewise be proved by some overt act; as by giving them intelligence, by feeding them provisions, by selling them arms, by treacherously surrendering a fortress, or the like.\n\n5. \"If a man counterfeit the king's great or privy seal,\" this is also high treason. But if a man takes wax bearing the impression of the great seal off from one patent, and fixes it to another, this is held to be only an abuse of the seal, and not a counterfeiting of it: as was the case of a certain chaplain, who in such a manner framed a dispensation for non-residence. But the knavish artifice of a lawyer much exceeded this of the divine. One of the clerks in chancery glued together two pieces of parchment; on the uppermost of which he wrote a patent, to which he regularly obtained the great seal, the label going through both the skins. He then dissolved the cement, and taking off the written patent, on the blank skin, wrote a fresh patent of a different import from the former, and published it as true. This was held no counterfeiting of the great seal, but only a great misprision; and Sir Edward Coke mentions it with some indignation that the party was living at that day.\n\n6. The sixth species of treason under this statute is, \"if a man counterfeit the king's money; and if a man bring false money into the realm counterfeit to the money of England, knowing the money to be false, to merchandise and make payment withal.\" As to the first branch, counterfeiting the king's money; this is treason, whether the false money be uttered in payment or not. Also if the king's own minters alter the standard or alloy established by law, it is treason. But gold and silver money only are held to be within this statute. With regard likewise to the second branch, importing foreign counterfeit money in order to utter it here; it is held that uttering it, without importing it, is not within the statute.\n\n7. The last species of treason ascertained by this statute is, \"if a man slay the chancellor, treasurer, or the king's justices of the one bench or the other, justices in eyre, or justices of assize, and all other justices assigned to hear and determine, being in their places doing their offices.\" These high magistrates, as they represent the king's majesty during the execution of their offices, are therefore for the time equally regarded by the law. But this statute extends only to the actual killing of them; and not to wounding, or a bare attempt to kill them. It extends also only to the officers therein specified; and therefore the barons of the exchequer, as such, are not within\nTreaon within the protection of this act; but the lord keeper or commissioners of the great seal now seem to be within it, by virtue of the statutes 5 Eliz. c. 18. and 1 W. and M. c. 21.\n\nThe new treasons, created since the statute 1 M. c. 1, and not comprehended under the description of statute 25 Edw. III., may be comprised under three heads. The first species relates to Papists; the second to falsifying the coin or other royal signatures, as falsely forging the sign manual, privy signet, or privy seal, which shall be deemed high treason (1 M. stat. ii. c. 6.). The third new species of high treason is such as was created for the security of the Protestant succession in the house of Hanover. For this purpose, after the act of settlement was made, it was enacted by statute 13 and 14 W. III. c. 3, that the pretended prince of Wales, assuming the title of King James III. should be attainted of high treason; and it was made high-treason for any of the king's subjects to hold correspondence with him or any person employed by him, or to remit money for his use. And by 17 Geo. II. c. 39, it is enacted, that if any of the sons of the pretender shall land or attempt to land in this kingdom, or be found in the kingdom or any of its dominions, he shall be adjudged attainted of high treason; and corresponding with them or remitting money to their use is made high-treason. By 1 Ann. stat. 2, c. 17, the offence of hindering the next in succession from succeeding to the crown is high-treason; and by 6 Ann. c. 7, if any person shall maliciously, advisedly, and directly, by writing or printing, maintain, that any other person hath any right to the crown of this realm, otherwise than according to the act of settlement, or that the kings of this realm with the authority of parliament are not able to make laws to bind the crown and its descent; such person shall be guilty of high treason.\n\nThe punishment of high treason in general is very solemn and terrible. 1. That the offender be drawn to the gallows, and not be carried or walk; though usually (by connivance, at length ripened by humanity into law) a pledge or hurdle is allowed, to preserve the offender from the extreme torment of being dragged on the ground or pavement. 2. That he be hanged by the neck, and then cut down alive. 3. That his entrails be taken out, and burned while he is yet alive. 4. That his head be cut off. 5. That his body be divided into four parts. 6. That his head and quarters be at the king's disposal.\n\nThe king may, and often doth, discharge all the punishment except beheading, especially where any of noble blood are attainted. For beheading being part of the judgement, that may be executed, though all the rest be omitted by the king's command. But where beheading is no part of the judgement, as in murder or other felonies, it hath been said that the king cannot change the judgement, although at the request of the party, from one species of death to another.\n\nIn the case of coining, which is a treason of a different complexion from the rest, the punishment is milder for male offenders; being only to be drawn and hanged by the neck till dead. But in treasons of every kind the punishment of women is the same, and different from that of men. For as the natural modelly of the sex forbids the exposing and publicly mangling their bodies, their sentence (which is to the full as terrible to fence as the other) is to be drawn to the gallows, and there to be burned alive.\n\nFor the consequences of this judgement, see Attainder, Forfeiture, and Corruption of Blood.\n\nPetty or Petit Treaon, according to the statute 25 Edward III. c. 2, may happen three ways: by a servant killing his master, a wife her husband, or an ecclesiastical person (either secular or regular) his superior, to whom he owes faith and obedience. A servant who kills his master whom he has left, upon a grudge conceived against him during his service, is guilty of petty treason: for the traitorous intention was hatched while the relation subsisted between them, and this is only an execution of that intention. So if a wife be divorced a mensa et thoro, till the vinculum matrimoniis subsists; and if she kills such divorced husband, she is a traitress. And a clergyman is understood to owe canonical obedience to the bishop who ordained him, to him in whose diocese he is beneficed, and also to the metropolitan of such suffragan or diocesan bishop; and therefore to kill any of these is petit treason. As to the rest, whatever has been said with respect to wilful Murder, is also applicable to the crime of petit treason, which is no other than murder in its most odious degree; except that the trial shall be as in cases of high treason, before the improvements therein made by the statutes of William III. But a person indicted of petit treason may be acquitted thereof, and found guilty of manslaughter or murder: and in such case it should seem that two witnesses are not necessary, as in cases of petit treason they are. Which crime is also distinguished from murder in its punishment.\n\nThe punishment of petit treason in a man, is to be drawn and hanged, and in a woman to be drawn and burned: the idea of which latter punishment seems to have been handed down to us from the laws of the ancient Druids, which condemned a woman to be burned for murdering her husband; and it is now the usual punishment for all sorts of treasons committed by those of the female sex. Persons guilty of petit treason were first debarred the benefit of clergy by statute 12 Henry VII. c. 7, which has since been extended to their aiders, abettors, and counsellors, by statutes 23 Henry VIII. c. 1, 4, and 5 P. and M. c. 4.","sp":72,"ep":75},{"h":"TRANSPORT","t":"from transit, \"it passes over,\" signifies the passage of any planet over the sun, moon, or stars.","sp":72,"ep":72},{"h":"TREASURE","t":"in general, denotes a store or stock of money in reserve.\n\nTREASURE-Trove, in Law, derived from the French word traver, \"to find,\" called in Latin thesaurus invenitus, is where any money or coin, gold, silver, plate, or bullion, is found hidden in the earth or other private place, the owner thereof being unknown; in which case the treasure belongs to the king: but if he that had hid it be known, or afterwards found out, the owner and not the king is intitled to it.\n\nTreasurer, an officer to whom the treasure of a prince or corporation is committed to be kept and duly disposed of, in payment of officers and other expenses.

It is not necessary to form a third class to include trees used for fuel, as timber is used for this purpose where it is abundant; and where it is not abundant the branches of the timber trees, or such of them as are dwarfish, unhealthy, or too small for mechanical purposes, are used as fuel.\n\nThe anatomy and physiology of trees have already been given under the generic name Plant and Sap.\n\nCertain trees, it is well known, are natives of particular districts; but many of them have been transplanted from their native soil, and now flourish luxuriantly in distant countries, so that it becomes a matter of very considerable difficulty to ascertain their original soil. The following rules are given for this purpose by the Honourable Daines Barrington.\n\n1. They must grow in large masses, and cover considerable tracts of ground, the woods not ending abruptly, by a change to other trees, except the situation and strata become totally different.\n2. They must grow kindly in copses, and shoot from the stool, so as to continue for ever, if not very carefully grubbed up.\n3. The seed must ripen kindly; nature never plants but where a succession in the greatest profusion will continue. Lastly, trees that give names to many places are probably indigenous.\n\nThe growth of trees is a curious and interesting subject; yet few experiments have been made to determine what the additions are which a tree receives annually in different periods of its age. The only observations which we have seen on this subject worth repeating were made by the ingenious Mr Barker, to whom the Philosophical Transactions are much indebted for papers containing an accurate register of the weather, which he has kept for many years. He has drawn up a table to point out the growth of three kinds of trees, oaks, ashes, and elms; which may be seen in the Philosophical Transactions for 1788. We shall give his conclusions.\n\n\"I find (says he) the growth of oak and ash to be nearly the same. I have some of both sorts planted at the same time, and in the same hedges, of which the oaks are the largest; but there is no certain rule as to that. The common growth of an oak or an ash is about an inch in girth in a year; some thriving ones will grow an inch and a half; the unthriving ones not so much. Great trees grow more timber in a year than small ones; for if the annual growth be an inch, a coat of one-sixth of an inch is laid on all round, and the timber added to the body every year is its length multiplied into the thickness of the coat and into the girth, and therefore the thicker the tree is, the more timber is added.\"\n\nWe will present our readers with a table, showing the growth of 17 kinds of trees for two years. The trees grew at Cavenham in Suffolk.\nSee Husbandry, No 165, where the growth of 11 kinds of trees in 21 years is given.\n\nTrees sometimes attain a very great size; this must depend in a great measure on the richness of soil, but no less on the degree of heat. Indeed heat is so essential to the growth of trees, that as we go from the place within the polar circles where vegetation begins, and advance to the equator, we find the trees increase in size. Greenland, Iceland, and other places in the same latitude, yield no trees at all; and the shrubs which they produce are dwarfish; whereas, in warm climates, they often grow to an immense size. Mr Martham saw spruce and silver firs in the dock-yard in Venice above 40 yards long, and one of 39 yards was 18 inches diameter at the small end. He was informed that they came from Switzerland.\n\nThe largest tree in Europe, mentioned by travellers, is the chestnut tree on Mount Etna, already described under the article Etna, No 18. It is a certain fact that trees acquire a very great size in volcanic countries. Beside the multitude of fine groves in the neighbourhood of Albano in Italy, there are many detached oaks 20 feet in circumference, and many elms of the same size, especially in the romantic way to Eufello, called the Galleria. In travelling by the side of the lake of Bolsena, the road leads through an immense number of oaks, spread upon beautiful hills. Where the lava has been sufficiently softened, they are clean and straight, and of a considerable size; but where the lava has not been converted into a soil proper for strong vegetation, they are round-headed, and of less size; however, taken all together, they make a magnificent appearance; and the spot itself ought to be ranked among the fine parts of Italy. The same may be observed of the small lake of Vico, encompassed with gentle risings, that are all clothed with forest-trees.\n\nSome yews have been found in Britain 60 feet round. Palms in Jamaica attain the height of 200 feet; and some of the pines in Norfolk island are 280 feet high.\n\nOf all the different kinds known in Europe, oak is best for building; and even when it lies exposed to air and water, there is none equal to it. Fir-timber is the next in degree of goodness for building, especially in England, where they build upon leaves. It differs from oak in this, that it requires not much seasoning, and therefore no great stock is required beforehand. Fir is used for flooring, wainscoting, and the ornamental parts of building within doors. Elm is the next in use, especially in England and France: it is very tough and pliable, and therefore easily worked: it does not readily split; and it bears driving of bolts and nails better than any other wood; for which reason it is chiefly used by wheelwrights and coach-makers, for shafts, naves, &c. Beech is also used for many purposes: it is very tough and white when young, and of great strength; but liable to warp very much when exposed to the weather, and to be worm eaten when used within doors; its greatest use is for planks, bedsteads, chairs, and other household goods. Ash is likewise a very useful wood, but very scarce in most parts of Europe; it serves in buildings, or for any other use, when screened from the weather; handpikes and oars are chiefly made of it. Wild chestnut timber is by many esteemed to be as good as oak, and seems to have been much used in old buildings; but whether these trees are more scarce at present than formerly, or have been found not to answer so well as was imagined, it is certain that this timber is now but little used. Walnut-tree is excellent for the joiner's use, it being of a more curious brown colour than beech, and not so subject to the worms. The poplar, alder, and alpen trees, which are very little different from each other, are much used instead of fir; they look well, and are tougher and harder.\n\nThe goodness of timber not only depends on the soil and situation in which it stands, but likewise on the season wherein it is felled. In this people disagree very much; some are for having it felled as soon as its fruit is ripe, others in the spring, and many in the autumn. But as the sap and moisture of timber is certainly the cause that it perishes much sooner than it otherwise would do, it seems evident, that timber should be felled where there is the least sap in it, viz. from the time that the leaves begin to fall till the trees begin to bud. This work usually commences about the end of April in England, because the bark then rises most freely; for where a quantity of timber is to be felled, the statute requires it to be done then, for the advantage of tanning. The ancients chiefly regarded the age of the moon in felling their timber; their rule was to fell it in the wane, or four days after the new moon, or sometimes in the last quarter. Pliny advises it to be in the very instant of the change; which happening to be in the last day of the winter solstice, the timber, says he, will be incorruptible.\n\nTimber should likewise be cut when of a proper age; for when it is either too young or too old, it will not be so durable as when cut at a proper age. It is said that oak should not be cut under 60 years old, nor above 200. Timber, however, should be cut in its prime, when almost fully grown, and before it begins to decay; and this will be sooner or later according to the dryness and moistness of the soil where the timber grows, as also according to the bigness of the trees; for there are no fixed rules in felling of timber, experience and judgment must direct here as in most other cases.\n\nGreat attention is necessary in the seasoning of timber.\nSome advise the planks of timber to be laid for a few days in some pool or running stream, in order to extract the sap, and afterwards to dry them in the sun or air. By this means, it is said, they will be prevented from either chopping, calting, or cleaving; but against shrinking there is no remedy. Some again are for burying them in the earth, others in a heat; and some for scorching and sealing them in fire, especially piles, pots, &c., which are to stand in water or earth. The Venetians first found out the method of seasoning by fire; which is done after this manner: They put the piece to be seasoned into a strong and violent flame; in this they continually turn it round by means of an engine, and take it out when it is everywhere covered with a black coaly crust; the internal part of the wood is thereby so hardened, that neither earth nor water can damage it for a long time afterwards.\n\nDr Plott says, it is found by long experience, that the trunk or body of the trees, when barked in the spring, and left standing naked all the summer exposed to the sun and wind, are so dried and hardened, that the fappy part in a manner becomes as firm and durable as the heart itself. This is confirmed by M. Buffon, who, in 1738, presented to the royal academy of sciences at Paris a memoir entitled, \"An easy method of increasing the solidity, strength, and duration of timber;\" for which purpose he observes, \"nothing more is necessary than to strip the tree entirely of its bark during the season of the rising of the sap, and to leave it to dry completely before it be cut down.\"\n\nBy many experiments, particularly described in that essay, it appears, that the tree should not be felled till the third year after it has been stripped of the bark; that it is then perfectly dry, and the sap become almost as strong as the rest of the timber, and stronger than the heart of any other oak tree which has not been so stripped; and the whole of the timber stronger, heavier, and harder; from which he thinks it fair to conclude, that it is also more durable. \"It would no longer (he adds) be necessary, if this method were practised, to cut off the sap; the whole of the tree might be used as timber; one of 40 years growth would serve all the purposes for which one of 60 years is now required; and this practice would have the double advantage of increasing the quantity, as well as the strength and solidity, of the timber.\"\n\nThe navy board, in answer to the inquiries of the commissioners of the land revenue, in May 1789, informed them, that they had then standing some trees stripped of their bark two years before, in order to try the experiment of building one half of a floop of war with that timber, and the other half with timber felled and stripped in the common way. This very judicious mode of making the experiment, if it be properly executed, will undoubtedly go far to ascertain the effects of this practice. We are sorry that we are not able to inform our readers what was the result of the experiment.\n\nAfter the planks of timber have been well seasoned and fixed in their places, care is to be taken to defend or preserve them; to which the smearing them with linseed oil, tar, or the like oleaginous matter, contributes much. The ancients, particularly Hesiod and Virgil, advise the smoke-drying of all instruments made of wood, by hanging them up in the chimneys where wood fires are used. The Dutch preserve their gates, portcullises, drawbridges, sluices, &c., by coating them over with a mixture of pitch and tar, wherein they strew small pieces of cockle and other shells, beaten almost to powder, and mixed with sea-sand, which incrusts and arms them wonderfully against all assaults of wind and weather. When timber is felled before the sap is perfectly at rest, it is very subject to worms; but to prevent and cure this, Mr Evelyn recommends the following remedy as the most approved: Put common sulphur into a cucubit, with as much aquafortis as will cover it three fingers deep; distil it to dryness, which is performed by two or three rectifications. Lay the sulphur that remains at bottom, being of a blackish or land-red colour, on a marble, or put it in a glaas, and it will dissolve into an oil; with this oil anoint the timber which is infected with worms. This, he says, will not only prevent worms, but preserve all kinds of woods, and many other things, as ropes, nets, and mats, from putrefaction, either in water, air, or snow.\n\nAn experiment to determine the comparative durability of different kinds of timber, when exposed to the weather, was made by a nobleman in Norfolk; of which account is given by Sir Thomas Beevor. This nobleman, in the year 1774, ordered three posts, forming two sides of a quadrangle, to be fixed in the earth on rising ground in his park. Into these posts were mortised planks, an inch and a half thick, cut out of trees from 30 to 45 years growth. These, after standing 10 years, were examined, and found in the following state and condition:\n\nThe cedar was perfectly sound; larch, the heart sound, but the sap quite decayed; spruce fir, sound; silver fir, in decay; Scotch fir, much decayed; pine, after, quite rotten; chestnut, perfectly sound; abele, sound; beech, sound; walnut, in decay; sycamore, much decayed; birch, quite rotten. Sir Thomas Beevor justly remarks, that the trees ought to have been of the same age; and Mr Arthur Young adds, they ought to have been cut out of the same plantation.\n\nThe immense quantity of timber consumed of late years in ship-building and other purposes has diminished in a very great degree the quantity produced in this country. On this account, many gentlemen who well know their country, alarmed with the fear of a scarcity, have strongly recommended it to government to pay some attention to the cultivation and preservation of timber.\n\nWe find, on the best authority, that of Mr Irving inspector general of imports and exports, that the shipping of England in 1760 amounted to 6107 in number, the tonnage being 433,922; and the shipping in Scotland amounted to 976 in number, the tonnage being 52,818. In 1788 the whole shipping of Britain and Ireland and their colonies amounted to 13,800, being 1,359,732 tons burden, and employing 107,925 men. The tonnage of the royal navy in the same year was 413,667. We are informed also, on what we consider as the best authority (the report of the commissioners of the land revenue), that the quantity of oak timber, of English growth, delivered into the dockyards from 1760 to 1788 was no less than 768,676 loads, and that the quantity used in the merchants yards in the same time was 516,630 loads; in all 1,285,306 loads. The foreign oak used in the same period was only 137,766 loads.\nloads. So that, after deducting the quantity remaining in the dock-yards in 1760 and 1788, and the foreign oak, there will remain about 1,054,284 loads of English oak, consumed in 28 years, which is at an average 37,653 loads per annum, besides from 8,300 to 10,000 loads expended annually by the East India company within the same period (a).\n\nThe price of wood has risen in proportion to the demand and to its diminution. At the conquest, woods were valued, not by the quantity of timber which they contained, but the number of swine which the acorns could support. In 1608, oak in the forests was sold at 10s. per load, and firewood for 2s. per load. In 1663 or 1665, in navy contracts from 2l. to 2l. 1s. 6d. per load was given. In 1776 it rose to 4l. 5s. per load, and 3s. in addition, because no tops are received. Plank four inch fold in 1769 for 7l. a load, three inch 6l.; which prices were the same in 1792.\n\nSo great an expenditure of valuable timber within so short a period, gives reason to fear that the forests of this country will soon be entirely dismantled, unless something is done to raise fresh supplies. The building of a 70 gun ship, it is said, would take 40 acres of timber. This calculation is indeed too extreme, that it is scarcely credible. This, however, is no exaggeration.\n\nAccording to the prevailing opinion of experienced surveyors, it will require a good soil and good management to produce 40 trees on an acre, which, in a hundred years, may, at an average, be computed at two loads each. Reckoning, therefore, two loads at 8l. 16s., one acre will be worth 350l. and consequently 40 acres will only be worth 14,000l. Now a 70 gun ship is generally supposed to cost 70,000l.; and as ships do not last a great many years, the navy continually requires new ships, so that the forests must be stripped in a century or two, unless young trees are planted to supply their place.\n\nMany plans have been proposed for recruiting the forests. Premiums have been held forth to individuals; and it has been proposed that the crown-lands should be set apart for the special purpose of raising timber. With respect to individuals, as they must generally be disposed to sow or plant their lands with those vegetables which will best reward their labours, it is not to be expected that they will set apart their fields for planting trees unless they have a greater return from them than other crops. But bad must that land be which will not yield much more than 350l. produce in 100 years. But though it be evident that good land will produce crops much more lucrative to the proprietor than timber, yet still there are lands or pieces of land which might be applied with very great advantage to the production of wood. Uneven ground, or the sides of fields where corn cannot be cultivated, might very properly be set apart for this purpose; barren lands, or such as cannot be cultivated without great labour and expense, might also be planted. Hedge-rows and clumps of trees, and little woods scattered up and down, would shelter and defend the fields from destructive winds, would beautify the face of the country, render the climate warmer, improve barren lands, and furnish wood for the arts and manufactures.\n\nBut to cultivate forest timber has also been thought of such national importance, that it has been deemed worthy of the attention of government. It has been proposed to appropriate such part of the crown-lands as are fit for the purpose solely of producing timber for the navy. This appears a very proper scheme in speculation; but it has been objected, that for government to attempt the farming of forests would be really to establish groups of officers to pocket salaries for doing what, it is well known, will never be done at all. But to this objection we reply, that such an agreement might be made with the inspectors of forests, as to make it their own interest to cultivate trees with as much care as possible. Their salary might be fixed very low, and raised in proportion to the number of trees which they could furnish of such a size in a certain number of years. After all, we must acknowledge that we must depend greatly on Russia, Sweden, Norway, and America, for supplying us with timber; and while these countries take our manufactures in exchange, we have no reason to complain. Still, however, we ought surely not to neglect the cultivation of what is of so much importance to our existence as a nation, for it may often be impossible in time of war to obtain timber from foreign countries.\n\nIn the beginning of this article we mentioned the general division of trees into timber or forest-trees and fruit trees. We have already said all that our limits will permit respecting the former: we will now, therefore, say something of the latter. Our observations shall be confined to the methods of preserving fruit trees in blossom from the effects of frost, and from other diseases to which they are liable.\n\nThe Chevalier de Dienenberg of Prague, we are told in the Magazine, has discovered a method of effectually preserving trees in March blossom from the fatal effects of those frosts which sometimes in the spring destroy the most promising hopes of a plentiful crop of fruit. His method is extremely simple. He surrounds the trunk of the tree in blossom with a wisp of straw or hemp. The end of this he sinks, by means of a stone tied to it, in a vessel of spring water, at a little distance from the tree. One vessel will conveniently serve two trees: or the cord may be lengthened so as to surround several, before its end is plunged into the water. It is necessary that the vessel be placed in an open situation, and by no means shaded by the branches of the neighbouring trees, that the frost may produce all its effect on the water, by means of the cord communicating with it.\u2014This precaution is particularly necessary for those trees the flowers of which appear nearly at the same time as the leaves; which trees are peculiarly exposed to the ravages of the frost. The proofs of its efficacy, which he had an opportunity of observing in the\n\n(a) A writer in the Bath Transactions says, that the aggregate of oaks felled in England and Wales for 30 years past has amounted to 320,000 loads a-year; and affirms that he has documents in his possession founded on indisputable facts. The difference between this account, and that which we have given in the text from the report of the commissioners, we leave to be reconciled by those who have proper opportunities. We give the facts merely on the authority of others.\nspring of 1787, were remarkably striking. Seven apricot espaliers in his garden began to blossom in the month of March. Fearing that they would suffer from the late frosts, he surrounded them with cords as above directed. In effect, pretty sharp frosts took place six or eight nights; the apricot-trees in the neighbouring gardens were all frozen, and none of them produced any fruit, whilst each of the chevalier's produced fruit in abundance, which came to the greatest perfection.\n\nThe following is the method proposed by Mr William Forsyth for curing injuries and defects in trees; for which a reward was given to him by his Majesty, on condition that he should make it public. It is equally applicable to forest as to fruit trees (B).\n\nTake one bushel of fresh cow-dung, half a bushel of lime rubbish of old buildings (that from the ceilings of rooms is preferable); half a bushel of wood ashes; and a sixteenth part of a bushel of pit or river sand. The three last articles are to be sifted fine before they are mixed; then work them well together with a spade, and afterwards with a wooden beater, until the stuff is very smooth, like fine plaster used for the ceilings of rooms. The composition being thus made, care must be taken to prepare the tree properly for its application by cutting away all the dead, decayed, and injured parts, till you come to the fresh found wood, leaving the surface of the wood very smooth, and rounding off the edges of the bark with a draw-knife, or other instrument, perfectly smooth, which must be particularly attended to. Then lay on the plaster about one-eighth of an inch thick all over the part where the wood or bark has been so cut away, finishing off the edges as thin as possible. Then take a quantity of dry powder of wood-ashes, mixed with a sixth part of the same quantity of the ashes of burnt bones; put it into a tin box, with holes in the top, and shake the powder on the surface of the plaster, till the whole is covered over with it, letting it remain for half an hour to absorb the moisture; then apply more powder, rubbing it on gently with the hand, and repeating the application of the powder, till the whole plaster becomes a dry smooth surface.\n\nAll trees cut down near the ground should have the surface made quite smooth, rounding it off in a small degree, as before mentioned; and the dry powder directed to be used afterwards should have an equal quantity of powder of alabaster mixed with it, in order the better to resist the dripping of trees and heavy rains. If any of the composition be left for a future occasion, it should be kept in a tub or other vessel, and urine of any kind poured on it, so as to cover the surface; otherwise the atmosphere will greatly hurt the efficacy of the application. Where lime rubbish of old buildings cannot be easily got, take powdered chalk, or common lime, after having been flaked a month at least. As the growth of the tree will gradually affect the plaster, by raising up its edges next the bark, care should be taken, where that happens, to rub it over with the finger when occasion may require (which is best done when moistened by rain), that the plaster may be kept whole, to prevent the air and wet from penetrating into the wound.\n\nBy this process, some old worn-out pear trees, that Forsyth bore only a few small, hard fruit, of a kernelly texture, were made to produce pears of the best quality and finest flavour the second summer after the operation; and in four or five years they bore such plenteous crops, as a young healthy tree would not have produced in four times that period.\n\nBy this process, too, some large ancient elms, in a most decayed state, having all their upper parts broken, and a small portion only of the bark remaining, shot out stems from their tops, above thirty feet in height, in six or seven years from the first application of the composition.\n\nThus may valuable trees be renovated; and forest trees, which are useful or ornamental from their particular situation, be preserved in a flourishing state. But what is far more interesting, a perfect cure has been made, and sound timber produced, in oak trees, which had received very considerable damage from blows, bruises, cutting of deep letters, the rubbing off the bark by the ends of rollers, or wheels of carts, or from the breaking of branches by storms.\n\nTREFOIL.

The decrees of this council, together with the creed of Pope Pius IV., contain a summary of the doctrines of the Roman Catholics. These decrees were subscribed by 255 clergy, consisting of four legates, 2 other cardinals, 3 patriarchs, 25 archbishops, 168 bishops, besides inferior clergy.

Civil Trials. The species of trials in civil cases are seven: By record; by inspection or examination; by certificate; by witness; by wager of battle; by wager of law; and by jury. The first five are only had in certain special or eccentric cases, where the trial by jury would not be so proper or effectual: (See them explained under their respective titles). The nature of the last, that principal criterion of truth in the law of England, shall be explained in this article.\n\nAs trial by jury is esteemed one of the most important privileges which members of society can enjoy, and the bulwark of the British constitution, every man of reflection must be stimulated by the desire of inquiring into its origin and history, as well as to be acquainted with the forms and advantages by which it is accompanied. We will therefore begin with tracing it to its origin. Its institution has been ascribed to our Saxon ancestors by Sir William Blackstone.\n\n\"Several authors (says that illustrious lawyer) have endeavoured to trace the original of juries up as high as the Commentaries themselves, the first inhabitants of our island; but certain it is that they were in use among the earliest Saxon colonies, their institution being ascribed by Bishop Nicholson to Woden himself, their great legislator and captain. Hence it is, that we may find traces of juries in the laws of all those nations which adopted the feudal system, as in Germany, France, and Italy; who had all of them a tribunal composed of twelve good men and true, boni homines, usually the vassals or tenants of the lord, being the equals or peers of the parties litigant; and, as the lord's vassals judged each other in the lord's courts, so the king's vassals, or the lords themselves, judged each other in the king's court. In England we find actual mention of them so early as the laws of King Ethelred, and that not as a new invention. Siemnhoek ascribes the invention of the jury, which in the Teutonic language is denominated nemlda, to Regnier king of Sweden and Denmark, who was contemporary with our King Egbert. Just as we are apt to impute the invention of this, and some other pieces of juridical policy, to the superior genius of Alfred the Great; to whom, on account of his having done much, it is usual to attribute everything: and as the tradition of ancient Greece placed to the account of their own Hercules whatever achievement was performed superior to the ordinary prowess of mankind. Whereas the truth seems to be, that this tribunal was universally established among all the northern nations, and so interwoven in their very constitution,\nconstitution, that the earliest accounts of the one give us also some traces of the other.\"\n\nThis opinion has been controverted with much learning and ingenuity by Dr Pettingal in his Inquiry into the Use and Practice of Juries among the Greeks and Romans, who deduces the origin of juries from these ancient nations.\n\nHe begins with determining the meaning of the word \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 in the Greek, and judices in the Roman, writers. \"The common acceptation of these words (says he), and the idea generally annexed to them, is that of presidents of courts, or, as we call them, judges; as such they are understood by commentators, and rendered by critics. Dr Middleton, in his life of Cicero, expressly calls the judges, judges of the bench; and Archbishop Potter, and in short all modern writers upon the Greek or Roman orators, or authors in general, express \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 and judices by such terms as convey the idea of presidents in courts of justice. The propriety of this is doubted of, and hath given occasion for this inquiry; in which is shown, from the best Greek and Roman authorities, that neither the \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 of the Greeks, nor the judices of the Romans, ever signified presidents in courts of judicature, or judges of the bench; but, on the contrary, they were distinguished from each other, and the difference of their duty and function was carefully and clearly pointed out by the orators in their pleadings, who were the best authorities in those cases, where the question related to forms of law, and methods of proceeding in judicial affairs and criminal process.\n\nThe presidents of the courts in criminal trials at Athens were the nine archons, or chief magistrates, of which whoever presided was called \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9\u03bd \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2, or president of the court. These nine presided in different causes peculiar to each jurisdiction. The archon, properly so called, had belonging to his department all pupillary and heritable cases; the \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2 or rex sacrorum, the chief priest, all cases where religion was concerned; the polemarchus, or general, the affairs of the army and all military matters; and the six thesmothet\u00e6, the other ordinary suits.\n\nWherever then the \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9\u03bd \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2, or judicial men, are addressed by the Greek orators in their speeches, they are not to be understood to be the presiding magistrates, but another class of men, who were to inquire into the state of the cause before them, by witnesses and other methods of coming at truth; and after inquiry made and witnesses heard, to report their opinion and verdict to the president, who was to declare it.\n\nThe several steps and circumstances attending this judicial proceeding are so similar to the forms observed by our jury, that the learned reader, for such I must suppose him, cannot doubt but that the nature, intent, and proceedings of the \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 among the Greeks were the same with the English jury; namely, for the protection of the lower people from the power and oppression of the great, by administering equal law and justice to all ranks; and therefore when the Greek orators directed their speeches to the \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9\u03bd \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2, as we see in Demosthenes, Aeschines, and Lyfas, we are to understand it in the same sense as when our lawyers at the bar say, Gentlemen of the jury.\n\nSo likewise among the Romans, the judices, in their pleadings at the bar, never signified judges of the bench, or presidents of the court, but a body or order of men, whose office in the courts of judicature was distinct from that of the praetor or judex quaestionis, which answered to our judge of the bench, and was the same with the archon, or \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9\u03bd \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2, of the Greeks; whereas the duty of the judices consisted in being impannelled, as we call it, challenged, and swore to try uprightly the case before them; and when they had agreed upon their opinion or verdict, to deliver it to the president who was to pronounce it. This kind of judicial process was first introduced into the Athenian polity by Solon, and thence copied into the Roman republic, as probable means of procuring just judgement, and protecting the lower people from the oppression or arbitrary decisions of their superiors.\n\nWhen the Romans were settled in Britain as a province, they carried with them their jura and instituta, their laws and customs, which was a practice essential to all colonies; hence the Britons, and other countries of Germany and Gaul, learned from them the Roman laws and customs; and upon the irruption of the northern nations into the southern kingdoms of Europe, the laws and institutions of the Romans remained, when the power that introduced them was withdrawn; and Montesquieu tells us, that under the first race of kings in France, about the fifth century, the Romans that remained, and the Burgundians their new masters, lived together under the same Roman laws and police, and particularly the same forms of judicature. How reasonable then is it to conclude, that in the Roman courts of judicature continued among the Burgundians, the form of a jury remained in the same state it was used at Rome. It is certain, Montesquieu, speaking of those times, mentions the paires or hommes de fie, homagers or peers, which in the same chapter he calls juges, judges or jurymen; so that we hence see how at that time the hommes de fie, or \"men of the fie,\" were called peers, and those peers were juges or jurymen. These were the same as are called in the laws of the Con- fessor pers de la tenure, the \"peers of the tenure, or homagers,\" out of whom the jury of peers were chosen, to try a matter in dispute between the lord and his tenant, or any other point of controversy in the manor. So likewise in all other parts of Europe, where the Roman colonies had been, the Goths succeeding them, continued to make use of the same laws and institutions, which they found to be established there by the first conquerors. This is a much more natural way of accounting for the origin of a jury in Europe, than having recourse to the fabulous story of Woden and his savage Scythian companions, as the first introducers of so humane and beneficent an institution.\"\n\nTrials by jury in civil causes are of two kinds; extraordinary and ordinary.\n\n1. The first species of extraordinary trial by jury is that of the grand assize, which was instituted by King Henry II. in parliament, by way of alternative offered to the choice of the tenant or defendant in a writ of right instead of the barbarous and unchristian custom of duelling. For this purpose a writ de magna assisa eligenda is directed to the sheriff, to return four knights, who are to elect and choose 12 others to be joined with them; and these all together form the grand assize, or great jury, which is to try the matter of right, and must now consist of 16 jurors. Another species of extraordinary juries is the jury to try an attainder; which is a process commenced against a former jury for bringing a false verdict. See the article ATTAINDE.\n2. With regard to the ordinary trial by jury in civil cases, the most clear and perspicuous way of treating it will be by following the order and course of the proceedings themselves.\n\nWhen therefore an issue is joined by these words, \"And this the said A prays may be inquired of by the country;\" or, \"And of this he puts himself upon the country, and the said B does the like;\" the court awards a writ of *venire facias* upon the roll or record, commanding the sheriff \"that he cause to come here, on such a day, twelve free and lawful men, *liberos et legales hominum*, of the body of his country, by whom the truth of the matter may be better known, and who are neither of kin to the aforesaid A nor the aforesaid B, to recognize the truth of the issue between the said parties.\" And such writ is accordingly issued to the sheriff. It is made returnable on the last return of the same term wherein issue is joined, viz. Hilary or Trinity terms; which, from the making up of the issues therein, are usually called *affisible terms*. And he returns the names of the jurors in a panel (a little pane or oblong piece of parchment) annexed to the writ. This jury is not summoned, and therefore not appearing at the day must unavoidably make default. For which reason a compulsive process is now awarded against the jurors, called in the common pleas a writ of *habeas corpora juratorum*, and in the King's Bench *diffringas*, commanding the sheriff to have their bodies, or to distrain them by their lands and goods, that they may appear upon the day appointed. The entry therefore on the roll of record is, \"That the jury is respited, through defect of the jurors, till the first day of the next term, then to appear at Westminster; unless before that time, viz. on Wednesday the fourth of March, the justices of our lord the king appointed to take assizes in that county shall have come to Oxford, that is, to the place assigned for holding the assizes. Therefore the sheriff is commanded to have their bodies at Westminster on the said first day of next term, or before the said justice of assize, if before that time they come to Oxford, viz. on the fourth of March aforesaid.\" And as the judges are sure to come and open the circuit commissions on the day mentioned in the writ, the sheriff returns and summons this jury to appear at the assizes; and there the trial is had before the justices of assize and *nisi prius*: among whom (as hath been said) are usually two of the judges of the courts at Westminster, the whole kingdom being divided into six circuits for this purpose. And thus we may observe, that the trial of common issues, at *nisi prius*, was in its original only a collateral incident to the original business of the justices of assize; though now, by the various revolutions of practice, it is become their principal civil employment; hardly anything remaining in use of the real assizes but the name.\n\nIf the sheriff be not an indifferent person, as if he be a party in the suit, or be related by either blood or affinity to either of the parties, he is not then trusted to return the jury; but the *venire* shall be directed to the coroners, who in this, as in many other instances, are the substitutes of the sheriff to execute process when he is deemed an improper person. If any exception lies to the coroners, the *venire* shall be directed to two clerks of the court, or two persons of the county named by the court, and sworn. And these two, who are called *efforters*, or electors, shall indifferently name the jury, and their return is final; no challenge being allowed to their array.\n\nLet us now pause a while, and observe (with Sir Matthew Hale *) in these first preparatory stages of the trial, how admirably this constitution is adapted and framed for the investigation of truth beyond any other method of trial in the world. For, first, the person returning the jurors is a man of some fortune and consequence; that so he may be not only less tempted to commit wilful errors, but likewise be responsible for the faults of either himself or his officers: and he is also bound by the obligation of an oath faithfully to execute his duty. Next, as to the time of their return: the panel is returned to the court upon the original *venire*, and the jurors are to be summoned and brought in many weeks afterwards to the trial, whereby the parties may have notice of the jurors, and of their sufficiency or insufficiency, characters, connections, and relations, that so they may be challenged upon just cause; while, at the same time, by means of the compulsory process (of *diffringas*, or *habeas corpora*) the cause is not likely to be retarded through defect of jurors. Thirdly, As to the place of their appearance: which in causes of weight and consequence is at the bar of the court; but in ordinary cases at the assizes, held in the county where the cause of action arises, and the witnesses and jurors live: a provision most excellently calculated for the saving of expense to the parties. For though the preparation of the causes in point of pleading is transacted at Westminster, whereby the order and uniformity of proceeding is preserved throughout the kingdom, and multiplicity of forms is prevented; yet this is no great charge or trouble, one attorney being able to transact the business of 40 clients. But the troublesome and most expensive attendance is that of jurors and witnesses at the trial; which therefore is brought home to them, in the county where most of them inhabit. Fourthly, The persons before whom they are to appear, and before whom the trial is to be held, are the judges of the superior court, if it be a trial at bar; or the judges of assize, delegated from the courts at Westminster by the king, if the trial be held in the country: persons, whose learning and dignity secure their jurisdiction from contempt, and the novelty and very parade of whose appearance have no small influence upon the multitude. The very point of their being strangers in the county is of infinite service, in preventing those factions and parties which would intrude in every cause of moment, were it tried only before persons resident on the spot, as justices of the peace, and the like. And the better to remove all suspicion of partiality, it was wisely provided by the statutes 4 Edw. III. c. 2. 8 Ric. II. c. 2. and 33 Hen. VIII. c. 24, that no judge of assize should hold pleas in any county wherein he was born or inhabits. And as this institution prevents party and faction from intermingling in the trial of right, so it keeps both the rule and the administration of the laws uniform. These justices, though thus varied and shifted at every assizes, are all sworn to the same laws, have had the same education, have pursued the same studies, converse and consult together, communicate their decisions and resolutions, and preside in those courts which are mutually connected, and their judgements blended together, as they are interchangeable courts of appeal or advice to each other. And hence their administration of justice, and conduct...\nconduct of trials, are consonant and uniform; whereby that confusion and contrariety are avoided, which would naturally arise from a variety of uncommunicating judges, or from any provincial establishment. But let us now return to the assizes.\n\nWhen the general day of trial is fixed, the plaintiff or his attorney must bring down the record to the assizes, and enter it with the proper officer, in order to its being called on in course.\n\nThese steps being taken, and the cause called on in court, the record is then handed to the judge, to peruse and observe the pleadings, and what issues the parties are to maintain and prove, while the jury is called and sworn. To this end the sheriff returns his compulsory process, the writ of habeas corpora, or distringas, with the panel of jurors annexed, to the judge's officer in court.\n\nThe jurors contained in the panel are either special or common jurors. Special juries were originally introduced in trials at bar, when the causes were of too great nicety for the discussion of ordinary freeholders; or where the sheriff was suspected of partiality, though not upon such apparent cause as to warrant an exception to him. He is in such cases, upon motion in court, and a rule granted thereupon, to attend the prothonotary or other proper officer with his freeholder's book; and the officer is to take indifferently 48 of the principal freeholders, in the presence of the attorneys on both sides: who are each of them to strike off 12, and the remaining 24 are returned upon the panel. By the statute Geo. II. c. 25, either party is entitled upon motion to have a special jury struck upon the trial of any issue, as well at the assizes as at bar, he paying the extraordinary expense, unless the judge will certify (in pursuance of the statute 24 Geo. II. c. 18.) that the cause required such special jury.\n\nA common jury is one returned by the sheriff according to the directions of the statute 3 Geo. II. c. 25, which appoints, that the sheriff or officer shall not return a separate panel for every separate cause, as formerly; but one and the same panel for every cause to be tried at the same assizes, containing not less than 48, nor more than 72, jurors: and that their names being written on tickets, shall be put into a box of glass; and when each cause is called, 12 of these persons, whose names shall be first drawn out of the box, shall be sworn upon the jury, unless absent, challenged, or excused; or unless a previous view of the messuages, lands, or place in question, shall have been thought necessary by the court; in which case, six or more of the jurors returned, to be agreed on by the parties, or named by a judge or other proper officer of the court, shall be appointed by special writ of habeas corpora or distringas, to have the matters in question shown to them by two persons named in the writ; and then such of the jury as have had the view, or so many of them as appear, shall be sworn on the inquest previous to any other jurors. These acts are well calculated to restrain any suspicion of partiality in the sheriff, or any tampering with the jurors when returned.\n\nAs the jurors appear when called, they shall be sworn, unless challenged by either party. See the article CHALLENGE.\n\nIf by means of challenges or other cause, a sufficient number of unexceptionable jurors doth not appear at the trial, either party may pray a tales.\n\nA tales is a supply of such men as are summoned upon the first panel, in order to make up the deficiency. For this purpose a writ of decem tales, octo tales, and the like, was wont to be issued to the sheriff at common law, and must be still so done at a trial at bar, if the jurors make default. But at the assizes, or nisi prius, by virtue of the statute 35 Hen. VIII. c. 6. and other subsequent statutes, the judge is empowered at the prayer of either party to award a tales de circumstantibus of persons present in court, to be joined to the other jurors to try the cause; who are liable, however, to the same challenges as the principal jurors. This is usually done till the legal number of 12 be completed; in which patriarchal and apotheistical number Sir Edward Coke hath discovered abundance of mystery.\n\nWhen a sufficient number of persons impanelled, or talemen appear, they are then separately sworn, well and truly to try the issue between the parties, and a true verdict to give according to the evidence; and hence they are denominated \"the jury,\" jurata, and \"jurors,\" i.e. juratores.\n\nThe jury are now ready to hear the merits; and to fix their attention the closer to the facts which they are impanelled and sworn to try, the pleadings are opened to them by counsel on that side which holds the affirmative of the question in issue. For the issue is said to lie, and proof is always first required upon that side which affirms the matter in question: in which our law agrees with the civil, ei incumbit probatio qui dicit, non qui negat; cum per rerum naturam factum-negantis probatio nulla sit.\n\nThe opening counsel briefly informs them what has been transacted in the court above; the parties, the nature of the action, the declaration, the plea, replication, and other proceedings; and lastly, upon what point the issue is joined, which is there sent down to be determined. Instead of which, formerly the whole record and process of the pleadings were read to them in English by the court, and the matter of issue clearly explained to their capacities. The nature of the case, and the evidence intended to be produced, are next laid before them by counsel also on the same side; and when their evidence is gone through, the advocate on the other side opens the adverse case, and supports it by evidence; and then the party which began is heard by way of reply. See Pleadings.\n\nEvidence in the trial by jury is of two kinds; either that which is given in proof, or that which the jury may receive by their own private knowledge. The former, or proofs, (to which in common speech the name of evidence is usually confined) are either written or parol; that is, by word of mouth. Written proofs, or evidence, are, 1. Records; and 2. Ancient deeds of 30 years standing, which prove themselves; but, 3. Modern deeds; and, 4. Other writings, must be attested and verified by parol evidence of witnesses. With regard to parol evidence or witnesses; it must first be remembered, that there is a process to bring them in by writ of subpoena ad testificandum; which commands them, laying aside all pretences and excuses, to appear at the trial on pain of 100l. to be forfeited to the king; to which the statute 5 Eliz. c. 9. has added a penalty of 10l. to the party aggrieved, and damages equivalent to the loss sustained by want of his evidence. But no witness, unless his reasonable expenses be tendered him, is bound to appear at all; nor, if he appear, is he bound\nto give evidence till such charges are actually paid him; except he resides within the bills of mortality, and is summoned to give evidence within the same. This compulsory process, to bring in unwilling witnesses, and the additional terrors of an attachment in case of disobedience, are of excellent use in the thorough investigation of truth: and, upon the same principle, in the Athenian courts, the witnesses who were summoned to attend the trial had their choice of three things: either to swear to the truth of the fact in question, to deny or abjure it, or else to pay a fine of 1000 drachmas.\n\nAll witnesses, of whatever religion or country, that have the use of their reason, are to be received and examined, except such as are infamous, or such as are interested in the event of the cause. All others are competent witnesses; though the jury from other circumstances will judge of their credibility. Infamous persons are such as may be challenged as jurors, proper delictum: and therefore never shall be admitted to give evidence to inform that jury, with whom they were too scandalous to associate. Interested witnesses may be examined upon a voir dire, if suspected to be secretly concerned in the event; or their interest may be proved in court. Which last is the only method of supporting an objection to the former clas; for no man is to be examined to prove his own infamy. And no counsel, attorney, or other person, intrusted with the secrets of the cause by the party himself, shall be compelled, or perhaps allowed, to give evidence of such conversation or matters of privacy as came to his knowledge by virtue of such trust and confidence: but he may be examined as to mere matters of fact, as the execution of a deed or the like, which might have come to his knowledge without being intrusted in the cause.\n\nOne witness (if credible) is sufficient evidence to a jury of any single fact: though undoubtedly the concurrence of two or more corroborates the proof. Yet our law considers that there are many transactions to which only one person is privy; and therefore does not always demand the testimony of two. Positive proof is always required, where, from the nature of the case, it appears it might possibly have been had. But, next to positive proof, circumstantial evidence, or the doctrine of presumptions, must take place: for when the fact itself cannot be demonstratively evinced, that which comes nearest to the proof of the fact is the proof of such circumstances which either necessarily or usually attend such facts; and these are called presumptions, which are only to be relied upon till the contrary be actually proved.\n\nThe oath administered to the witness is not only that what he deposes shall be true, but that he shall also depose the whole truth: so that he is not to conceal any part of what he knows, whether interrogated particularly to that point or not. And all this evidence is to be given in open court, in the presence of the parties, their attorneys, the counsel, and all bystanders; and before the judge and jury: each party having liberty to except to its competency, which exceptions are publicly stated, and by the judge are openly and publicly allowed or disallowed, in the face of the country: which must curb any secret bias or partiality that might arise in his own breast.\n\nWhen the evidence is gone through on both sides, the judge, in the presence of the parties, the counsel, and all others, sums up the whole to the jury; omitting all superfluous circumstances, obliterating wherein the main question and principal issue lies, stating what evidence has been given to support it, with such remarks as he thinks necessary for their direction, and giving them his opinion in matters of law arising upon that evidence.\n\nThe jury, after the proofs are summed up, unless the case be very clear, withdraw from the bar to consider of their verdict; and in order to avoid intemperance and casual delays, are to be kept without meat, drink, fire, or candle, unless by permission of the judge, till they are unanimously agreed. A method of accelerating unanimity not wholly unknown in other constitutions of Europe, and in matters of greater concern. For by the golden bull of the empire, if, after the congress is opened, the electors delay the election of a king of the Romans for 30 days, they shall be fed only with bread and water till the same is accomplished. But if our juries eat or drink at all, or have any eatables about them, without consent of the court, and before verdict, it is finable; and if they do so at his charge for whom they afterwards find, it will set aside the verdict. Also, if they speak with either of the parties or their agents after they are gone from the bar, or if they receive any fresh evidence in private, or if, to prevent disputes, they cast lots for whom they shall find, any of these circumstances will entirely vitiate the verdict. And it has been held, that if the jurors do not agree in their verdict before the judges are about to leave the town, though they are not to be threatened or imprisoned, the judges are not bound to wait for them, but may carry them round the circuit from town to town in a cart. This necessity of a total unanimity seems to be peculiar to our own constitution; or at least, in the nembdia or jury of the ancient Goths, there was required (even in criminal cases) only the consent of the major part; and in case of an equality, the defendant was held to be acquitted.\n\nWhen they are all unanimously agreed, the jury return back to the bar; and before they deliver their verdict, the plaintiff is bound to appear in court, by himself, attorney, or counsel, in order to answer the amercement to which by the old law he is liable, in case he fails in his suit, as a punishment for his false claim. To be amerced, or a merce, is to be at the king's mercy with regard to the fine to be imposed; in misericordia domini regis pro falso clamore fio. The amercement is dilated, but the form still continues; and if the plaintiff does not appear, no verdict can be given; but the plaintiff is said to be nonfuit, non sequitur clamorem suum. Therefore it is usual for a plaintiff, when he or his counsel perceives that he has not given evidence sufficient to maintain his issue, to be voluntarily nonfitted, or withdraw himself: whereupon the crier is ordered to call the plaintiff; and if neither he, nor any body for him, appears, he is nonfitted, the jurors are discharged, the action is at an end, and the defendant shall recover his costs. The reason of this practice is, that a nonfuit is more eligible for the plaintiff than a verdict against him: for after a nonfuit, which is only a default, he may commence the same suit again for the same cause of action; but after a verdict had, and judgment consequent thereupon, he is forever barred from attacking\nthe defendant upon the same ground of complaint. But in case the plaintiff appears, the jury by their foreman deliver in their verdict.\n\nA verdict, *vera dictum*, is either privy or public. A privy verdict is when the judge hath left or adjourned the court; and the jury, being agreed, in order to be delivered from their confinement, obtain leave to give their verdict privily to the judge out of court: which privy verdict is of no force, unless afterwards affirmed by a public verdict given openly in court; wherein the jury may, if they please, vary from their privy verdict. So that the privy verdict is indeed a mere nullity; and yet it is a dangerous practice, allowing time for the parties to tamper with the jury, and therefore very seldom indulged. But the only effectual and legal verdict is the public verdict: in which they openly declare to have found the issue for the plaintiff, or for the defendant; and if for the plaintiff, they affect the damages also sustained by the plaintiff, in consequence of the injury upon which the action is brought.\n\nWhen the jury have delivered in their verdict, and it is recorded in court, they are then discharged; and so ends the trial by jury: a trial which ever has been, and it is hoped ever will be, looked upon as the glory of the English law. It is certainly the most transcendant privilege which any subject can enjoy or wish for, that he cannot be affected either in his property, his liberty, or his person, but by the unanimous consent of 12 of his neighbours and equals. A constitution that we may venture to affirm has, under providence, secured the just liberties of this nation for a long succession of ages. And therefore a celebrated French writer*, who concludes, that because Rome, Sparta, and Carthage, have lost their liberties, therefore those of England in time must perish, should have recollected, that Rome, Sparta, and Carthage, at the time when their liberties were lost, were strangers to the trial by jury.\n\nGreat as this eulogium may seem, it is no more than this admirable constitution, when traced to its principles, will be found in sober reason to deserve.\n\nThe impartial administration of justice, which secures both our persons and our properties, is the great end of civil society. But if that be entirely entrusted to the magistracy, a select body of men, and those generally selected by the prince or such as enjoy the highest offices in the state, their decisions, in spite of their own natural integrity, will have frequently an involuntary bias towards those of their own rank and dignity: it is not to be expected from human nature, that the few should be always attentive to the interests and good of the many. On the other hand, if the power of judicature were placed at random in the hands of the multitude, their decisions would be wild and capricious, and a new rule of action would be every day established in our courts. It is wisely therefore ordered, that the principles and axioms of law, which are general propositions flowing from abstracted reason, and not accommodated to times or to men, should be deposited in the breasts of the judges, to be occasionally applied to such facts as come properly ascertained before them. For here partiality can have little scope; the law is well known, and is the same for all ranks and degrees: it follows as a regular conclusion from the premises of fact pre-established. But in settling and adjusting a question of fact, when intrusted to any single magistrate, partiality and injustice have an ample field to range in, either by boldly asserting that to be proved which is not so, or more artfully by suppressing some circumstances, stretching and warping others, and distinguishing away the remainder. Here therefore a competent number of sensible and upright jurymen, chosen by lot from among those of the middle rank, will be found the best investigators of truth, and the surest guardians of public justice. For the most powerful individual in the state will be cautious of committing any flagrant invasion of another's right, when he knows that the fact of his oppression must be examined and decided by 12 indifferent men not appointed till the hour of trial; and that when once the fact is ascertained, the law must of course redress it. This therefore preserves in the hands of the people that share which they ought to have in the administration of public justice, and prevents the encroachments of the more powerful and wealthy citizens.\n\n**Criminal Trials.** The regular and ordinary method of proceeding in the courts of criminal jurisdiction may be distributed under 12 general heads, following each other in a progressive order: viz. 1. Arrest; 2. Commitment and bail; 3. Prosecution; 4. Proceeds; 5. Arraignment, and its incidents; 6. Plea, and issue; 7. Trial, and conviction; 8. Clergy; 9. Judgement, and its consequences; 10. Reversal of judgement; 11. Reprieve, or pardon; 12. Execution. See Arrest, Commitment, Presentment, Indictment, Information, Appeal, Process upon an Indictment, Arraignment, and Plea; in which articles all the forms which precede the trial are described, and are here enumerated in the proper order.\n\nThe several methods of trial and conviction of offenders, established by the laws of England, were formerly more numerous than at present, through the superstition of our Saxon ancestors; who, like other northern nations, were extremely addicted to divination; a character which Tacitus observes of the ancient Germans. They therefore invented a considerable number of methods of purgation or trial, to preserve innocence from the danger of false witnesses, and in consequence of a notion that God would always interpose miraculously to vindicate the guiltless; as, 1. By Ordeal; 2. By Cursing; 3. By Battel. See these articles.\n\n4. A fourth method is that by the peers of Great Britain, in the Court of Parliament; or the Court of the Lord High Steward, when a peer is capitally indicted; or in case of an appeal, a peer shall be tried by jury. This differs little from the trial per patriam, or by jury; except that the peers need not all agree in their verdict; and except also, that no special verdict can be given in the trial of a peer; because the lords of parliament, or the lord high steward (if the trial be had in his court), are judges sufficiently competent of the law that may arise from the fact; but the greater number, consisting of 12 at the least, will conclude, and bind the minority.\n\nThe trial by jury, or the country, per patriam, is also that trial by the peers of every Briton, which, as the great bulwark of his liberties, is secured to him by the great charter: *nullus liber homo capitatur, vel impriso- netur, aut exulet, aut aliquo alio modo destruatur, nisi per legale judicium parium suorum, vel per legem terrae*.\n\nWhen therefore a prisoner on his Arraignment has pleaded not guilty, and for his trial hath put himself\nupon the country, which country the jury are, the sheriff of the county must return a panel of jurors, liberos et legales homines, de vicineto; that is, freeholders without just exception, and of the visine or neighbourhood; which is interpreted to be of the county where the fact is committed. If the proceedings are before the court of king's bench, there is time allowed between the arraignment and the trial, for a jury to be impanelled by writ of venire facias to the sheriff, as in civil causes; and the trial in case of a misdemeanor is had at nisi prius, unless it be of such consequence as to merit a trial at bar; which is always invariably had when the prisoner is tried for any capital offence. But, before commissioners of oyer and terminer and goal-delivery, the sheriff, by virtue of a general precept directed to him beforehand, returns to the court a panel of 48 jurors, to try all felons that may be called upon their trial at that session; and therefore it is usual to try all felons immediately or soon after their arraignment. But it is not customary, nor agreeable to the general course of proceedings, unless by consent of parties, to try persons indicted of smaller misdemeanors at the same court in which they have pleaded not guilty, or traversed the indictment. But they usually give security to the court to appear at the next assizes or session, and then and there to try the traverse, giving notice to the prosecutor of the same.\n\nIn cases of high-treason, whereby corruption of blood may ensue (except treason in counterfeiting the king's coin or seals), or misprision of such treason, it is enacted by statute 7 W. III. c. 3. first, that no person shall be tried for any such treason, except an attempt to assassinate the king, unless the indictment be found within three years after the offence committed: next, that the prisoner shall have a copy of the indictment (which includes the caption), but not the names of the witnesses, five days at least before the trial, that is, upon the true construction of the act, before his arraignment; for then is his time to take any exceptions thereto, by way of plea or demurrer; thirdly, that he shall also have a copy of the panel of jurors two days before his trial: and, lastly, that he shall have the same compulsory process to bring in his witnesses for him, as was usual to compel their appearance against him. And by statute 7 Ann. c. 21. (which did not take place till after the decease of the late pretender) all persons indicted for high-treason, or misprisions thereof, shall have not only a copy of the indictment, but a list of all the witnesses to be produced, and of the jurors impanelled, with their professions and places of abode, delivered to him ten days before the trial, and in the presence of two witnesses, the better to prepare him to make his challenges and defence. And no person indicted for felony is, or (as the law stands) ever can be, entitled to such copies before the time of his trial.\n\nWhen the trial is called on, the jurors are to be sworn as they appear, to the number of 12, unless they are challenged by the party.\n\nChallenges may here be made, either on the part of the king, or on that of the prisoner; and either to the whole array, or to the separate polls, for the very same reasons that they may be made in civil causes. But in criminal cases, or at least in capital ones, there is, in favorem vitae, allowed to the prisoner an arbitrary and capricious species of challenge, to a certain number of jurors, without showing any cause at all; which is called a peremptory challenge; a provision full of that tenderness and humanity to prisoners for which our English laws are justly famous. This is grounded on two reasons. 1. As every one must be sensible what sudden impressions and unaccountable prejudices we are apt to conceive upon the bare looks and gestures of another; and how necessary it is that a prisoner (when put to defend his life) should have a good opinion of his jury, the want of which might totally disconcert him; the law wills not that he should be tried by any one man against whom he has conceived a prejudice, even without being able to assign a reason for such his dislike. 2. Because, upon challenges for cause shown, if the reason assigned prove insufficient to set aside the juror, perhaps the bare questioning of his indifference may sometimes provoke a resentment; to prevent all ill consequences from which, the prisoner is still at liberty, if he pleases, peremptorily to set him aside.\n\nThe peremptory challenges of the prisoner must, however, have some reasonable boundary; otherwise he might never be tried. This reasonable boundary is settled by the common law to be the number of 35; that is, one under the number of three full juries.\n\nIf by reason of challenges or the default of the jurors, a sufficient number cannot be had of the original panel, a tales may be awarded as in civil causes, till the number of 12 is sworn, \"well and truly to try, and true deliverance make, between our sovereign lord the king and the prisoner whom they have in charge; and a true verdict to give, according to their evidence.\"\n\nWhen the jury is sworn, if it be a cause of any consequence, the indictment is usually opened, and the evidence marshalled, examined, and enforced by the counsel for the crown or prosecution. But it is a settled rule at common law, that no counsel shall be allowed a prisoner upon his trial upon the general issue, in any capital crime, unless some point of law shall arise proper to be debated. A rule which (however it may be palliated under cover of that noble declaration of the law, when rightly understood, that the judge shall be counsel for the prisoner; that is, shall see that the proceedings against him are legal and strictly regular) seems to be not at all of a piece with the rest of the humane treatment of prisoners by the English law. For upon what face of reason can that assistance be denied to save the life of a man, which yet is allowed him in prosecutions for every petty trespass? Nor indeed is it, strictly speaking, a part of our ancient law; for the Mirrour, having observed the necessity of counsel in civil suits, \"who know how to forward and defend the cause by the rules of law, and customs of the realm,\" immediately afterwards subjoins, \"and more necessary are they for defence upon indictments and appeals of felony, than upon other venial causes.\" And, to say the truth, the judges themselves are so sensible of this defect in our modern practice, that they seldom scruple to allow a prisoner counsel to stand by him at the bar, and to instruct him what questions to ask, or even to ask questions for him, with regard to matters of fact; for as to matters of law arising on the trial, they are, entitled to the assistance of counsel. But still this is a matter of too much importance to be left to the good pleasure of any judge, and is worthy the interposition of the legislature; which has shown its inclination to indulge\nprisoners with this reasonable assistance, by enabling, in statute 7 W. III. c. 3., that persons indicted for such high-treason as works a corruption of the blood or mis-prisonment thereof (except treason in counterfeiting the king's coins or seals), may make their full defence by counsel, not exceeding two, to be named by the prisoner, and assigned by the court or judge; and this indulgence, by statute 20 Geo. II. c. 30., is extended to parliamentary impeachments for high-treason, which were excepted in the former act.\n\nWhen the evidence on both sides is closed, the jury cannot be discharged (unless in cases of evident necessity) till they have given in their verdict. If they find the prisoner not guilty, he is then forever quit and discharged of the accusation, except he be appealed of felony within the time limited by law. And upon such his acquittal, or discharge for want of prosecution, he shall be immediately let at large without payment of any fee to the gaoler. But if the jury find him guilty, he is then said to be convicted of the crime whereof he stands indicted.

The country, though delightful to the eye, is unhealthy; from July to September, epidemic fevers, like those of Scanderoon and Cyprus, prevail, and are principally caused by the artificial inundations made for the purpose of watering the mulberry trees, to enable them to throw out their second leaves, and from a want of free circulation of air, the city being open only to the westward.","sp":105,"ep":105},{"h":"TRIPTHONG","t":"in Grammar, an assemblage or concourse of three vowels in one syllable; as que.","sp":105,"ep":105},{"h":"TRISMEGISTUS","t":"an epithet or surname given to one of the two Hermes.

The day appointed for the ceremony being arrived, scaffolds were erected in the forum and circus, and all the other parts of the city where they could best behold the pomp: the senate went to meet the conqueror without the gate called Capena or Triumphalis, and marched back in order to the Capitol; the ways being cleared and cleansed by a number of officers and stipendiaries, who drove away such as thronged the passage or struggled up and down. The general was clad in a rich purple robe, interwoven with figures of gold, setting forth his great exploits; his buskins were beset with pearls; and he wore a crown, which at first was only laurel, but afterwards gold; in one hand he bore\na branch of laurel, and in the other a truncheon. He was carried in a magnificent chariot, adorned with ivory and plates of gold, drawn usually by two white horses; though sometimes by other animals, as that of Pompey, when he triumphed over Africa, by elephants; that of Mark Antony by lions; that of Heliogabalus by tigers; that of Aurelian by deer, &c. His children were at his feet, and sometimes on the chariot-horses. The procession was led by the musicians, who played triumphal pieces in praise of the general: these were followed by young men, who led the victims to the sacrifice, with their horns gilded, and their heads adorned with ribbons and garlands; next came the carts and wagons, loaded with all the spoils taken from the enemy, with their horses, chariots, &c.; these were followed by the kings, princes, and generals, who had been taken captives, loaded with chains: after these appeared the triumphal chariot, before which, as it passed, they all along threw flowers, and the people with loud acclamations called out, Jo triumphe! The chariot was followed by the senate, clad in white robes; and the senate by such citizens as had been set at liberty or ransomed; and the procession was closed by the priests and their officers and utensils, with a white ox led along for the chief victim. In this order they proceeded through the triumphal gate, along the Via Sacra, to the Capitol, where the victims were slain.

The city of Troy, according to him, stood on the present site of the modern village of Boumarbachi, distant four leagues from the sea, and which is the residence of an aga, ruling with absolute sway the inhabitants of the Trojan plain and the inferior agas, to whom they are immediately subject. Boumarbachi is situated on the side of an eminence, exposed to every wind, at the termination of a spacious plain, the soil of which is rich and of a blackish colour. Close to the village is to be seen a marsh covered with tall reeds; and the situation is impregnable on all sides except at Erin (Homer's aqueduct), the hill of wild fig trees, which extended between the Sc\u00e6an gate and the sources of the Scamander.

Each troop of cavalry has one. The cords of the trumpets are of crimson, mixed with the colours of the facings of the regiments.\n\nAs to the invention of the trumpet, some Greek historians ascribe it to the Tyrrhenians; but others, with greater probability, to the Egyptians; from whom it might have been transmitted to the Israelites. The trumpet was not in use among the Greeks at the time of the Trojan war; though it was in common use in the time of Homer. According to Potter (Arch. Grac. vol. ii. cap. 9.), before the invention of trumpets, the first signals of battle in primitive wars were lighted torches; to these succeeded shells of fishes, which were founded like trumpets. And when the trumpet became common in military use, it may well be imagined to have served at first only as a rough and noisy signal of battle, like that at present in Abyssinia and New Zealand, and perhaps with only one sound. But, even when more notes were produced from it, so noisy an instrument must have been an unfit accompaniment for the voice and poetry; so that it is probable the trumpet was the first solo instrument in use among the ancients.","sp":107,"ep":107},{"h":"TRUMPET","t":"Articulate, comprehends both the speaking and the hearing trumpet, is by much the most valuable instrument, and has, in one of its forms, been used by people among whom we should hardly have expected to find such improvements.\n\nThat the speaking trumpet, of which the object is to increase the force of articulate sounds, should have been known to the ancient Greeks, can excite no wonder;\nTrumpet, and therefore we easily admit the accounts which we read of the horn or trumpet, with which Alexander addressed his army, as well as of the whispering caverns of the Syracusan tyrant. But that the natives of Peru were acquainted with this instrument, will probably surprise many of our readers. The fact, however, seems incontrovertible.\n\nIn the History of the Order of Jesuits, published at Naples in 1601 by Beritaria, it is said, that in the year 1593 a small convent of that order in Peru, situated in a remote corner, was in danger of immediate destruction by famine. One evening the superior Father Samaniac implored the help of the cacique; next morning, on opening the gate of the monastery, he found it surrounded by a number of women, each of whom carried a small basket of provisions. He returned thanks to heaven for having miraculously interposed, by inspiring the good people with pity for the distresses of his friars. But when he expressed to them his wonder how they came all to be moved as if by mutual agreement with these benevolent sentiments, they told him it was no such thing; that they looked upon him and his countrymen as a pack of infernal magicians, who by their sorceries had enslaved the country, and had bewitched their good cacique, who hitherto had treated them with kindness and attention, as became a true worshippers of the sun; but that the preceding evening at sunset he had ordered the inhabitants of such and such villages, about six miles off, to come that morning with provisions to this nest of wizzard.\n\nThe superior asked them in what manner the governor had warned so many of them in so short a time, at such a distance from his own residence? They told him that it was by the trumpet; and that every person heard at their own door the distinct terms of the order. The father had heard nothing; but they told him that none heard the trumpet but the inhabitants of the villages to which it was directed. This is a piece of very curious information; but, after allowing a good deal to the exaggeration of the reverend Jesuits, it cannot, we think, be doubted but that the Peruvians actually possessed this flentorophonic art. For we may observe that the effect described in this narration resembles what we now know to be the effect of speaking trumpets, while it is unlike what the inventor of such a tale would naturally and ignorantly say. Till speaking trumpets were really known, we should expect the sound to be equally diffused on all sides, which is not the case; for it is much stronger in the line of the trumpet than in any direction very oblique to it.\n\nAbout the middle of the 17th century, Athanasius Kircher turned his attention to the philosophy of sound, and in different works threw out many useful and scientific hints on the construction of speaking trumpets (see Acoustics and Kircher); but his mathematical illustrations were so vague, and his own character of inattention and credulity so notorious, that for some time these works did not attract the notice to which they were well entitled.\n\nAbout the year 1670, Sir Samuel Morland, a gentleman of great ingenuity, science, and order, took up the subject, and proposed as a question to the Royal Society of London, What is the best form for a speaking trumpet? which he called a flentorophonic horn. He accompanied his demand with an account of his own notions on the subject (which he acknowledged to be very vague and conjectural), and an exhibition of some instruments constructed according to his views. They were in general very large conical tubes, suddenly spreading at the very mouth to a greater width. Their effect was really wonderful. They were tried in St James's park; and his Majesty K. Charles II. speaking in his ordinary colloquial pitch of voice through a trumpet only 5\u00bd feet long, was clearly and most distinctly heard at the distance of a thousand yards. Another person, selected we suppose for the loudness and distinctness of his voice, was perfectly understood at the distance of four miles and a half. The fame of this soon spread; Sir Samuel Morland's principles were refined, considering the novelty of the thing, and differed considerably from Father Kircher's. The aerial undulations, (for he speaks very accurately concerning the nature of sound) endeavour to diffuse themselves in spheres, but are stopped by the tube, and therefore reundulate towards the axis like waves from a bank, and, meeting in the axis, they form a strong undulation a little farther advanced along the tube, which again spreads, is again reflected, and so on, till it arrives at the mouth of the tube greatly magnified, and then it is diffused through the open air in the same manner, as if all proceeded from a very sonorous point in the centre of the wide end of the trumpet. The author distinguishes with great judgment between the prodigious reinforcement of sound in a speaking trumpet and that in the musical trumpet, bugle-horn, conch-shell, &c.; and shows that the difference consists only in the violence of the first sonorous agitation, which can be produced by us only on a very small extent of surface. The mouth-piece diameter, therefore, of the musical trumpet must be very small, and the force of blast very considerable. Thus one strong but simple undulation will be excited, which must be subjected to the modifications of harmony, and will be augmented by using a conical tube (A). But a speaking trumpet must make no change on the nature of the first undulations; and each point of the mouth-piece must be equally considered as the centre of sonorous undulations, all of which must be reinforced in the same degree, otherwise all distinctness of articulation will be lost. The mouth-piece must therefore take in the whole of the mouth of the speaker.\n\nWhen Sir Samuel Morland's trumpet came to be generally known on the continent, it was soon discovered that the speaker could be heard at a great distance only in the line of the trumpet; and this circumstance was by Mr Cass\u00e9grain (Journ. des Savants, 1672, p. 131.) attributed to a defect in the principle of its construction, which he said was not according to the laws of sonorous undulations. He proposed a conoid formed by the revolution of a hyperbola round its asymptote as the best form. A Mr Hafe of W\u00fcrtemberg, on the other hand, proposed a parabolic conoid, having the mouth of the\n\n(a) Accordingly the sound of the bugle horn, of the musical trumpet, or the French horn, is prodigiously loud, when we consider the small passage through which a moderate blast is sent by the trumpeter.\nTrumpet speaker placed in the focus. In this construction he plainly went on the principle of a reflection similar to that of the rays of light; but this is by no means the case. The effect of the parabola will be to give one reflection, and in this all the circular undulations will be converted into plane waves, which are at right angles to the axis of the trumpet. But nothing hinders their subsequent diffusion; for it does not appear that the sound will be enforced, because the agitation of the particles on each wave is not augmented.\n\nThe subject is exceedingly difficult. We do not fully comprehend on what circumstance the affection or agitation of our organ, or simply of the membrana tympani, depends. A more violent agitation of the same air, that is, a wider oscillation of its particles, cannot fail to increase the impulse on this membrane. The point therefore is to find what concourse of feeble undulations will produce or be equivalent to a great one. The reasonings of all these reformers of the speaking trumpet are almost equally specious, and each point out some phenomenon which should characterize the principle of construction, and thus enable us to say which is most agreeable to the procedure of nature. Yet there is hardly any difference in the performance of trumpets of equal dimensions made after these different methods.\n\nThe propagation of light and of elastic undulations seem to require very different methods of management. Yet the ordinary phenomena of echoes are perfectly explainable by the acknowledged laws either of optics or acoustics; still however there are some phenomena of sound which are very unlike the genuine results of elastic undulations. If sounds are propagated spherically, then what comes into a room by a small hole should diffuse itself from that hole as round a centre, and it should be heard equally well at twelve feet distance from the hole in every direction. Yet it is very sensibly louder when the hearer is in the straight line drawn from the sonorous body through the hole. A person can judge of the direction of the sounding body with tolerable exactness. Cannon discharged from the different sides of a ship are very easily distinguished, which should not be the case by the Newtonian theory; for in this the two pulses on the ear should have no sensible difference.\n\nThe most important fact for our purpose is this: An echo from a small plane surface in the midst of an open field is not heard, unless we stand in such a situation that the angle of reflected sound may be equal to that of incidence. But by the usual theory of undulations, this small surface should become the centre of a new undulation, which should spread in all directions. If we make an analogous experiment on watery undulations, by placing a small flat surface so as to project a little above the water, and then drop in a small pebble at a distance, so as to raise one circular wave, we shall observe, that when this wave arrives at the projecting plane, it is disturbed by it, and this disturbance spreads from it on all sides. It is indeed sensibly stronger in that line which is drawn from it at equal angles with the line drawn to the place where the pebble was dropped. But in the case of sound, it is a fact, that if we go to a very small distance on either side of the line of reflection, we shall hear nothing.\n\nHere then is a fact, that whatever may be the nature of the elastic undulations, sounds are reflected from a small plane in the same manner as light. We may avail ourselves of this fact as a mean for enforcing sound, though we cannot explain it in a satisfactory manner. We should expect from it an effect similar to the hearing of the original sound along with another original sound coming from the place from which this reflected sound diverges. If therefore the reflected sound or echo arrives at the ear in the same instant with the original sound, the effect will be doubled; or at least it will be the same with two simultaneous original sounds. Now we know that this is in some sense equivalent to a stronger sound. For it is a fact, that a number of voices uttering the same or equal sounds are heard at a much greater distance than a single voice. We cannot perhaps explain how this happens by mechanical laws, nor affirm the exact proportion in which ten voices exceed the effect of one voice; nor the proportion of the distances at which they seem equally loud. We may therefore, for the present, suppose that two equal voices at the same distance are twice as loud, three voices three times as loud, &c. Therefore if, by means of a speaking trumpet, we can make ten equal echoes arrive at the ear at the same moment, we may suppose its effect to be to increase the audibility ten times; and we may express this shortly, by calling the sound ten times louder or more intense.\n\nBut we cannot do this precisely. We cannot by any contrivance make the sound of a momentary snap, and those of its echoes, arrive at the ear in the same moment, because they come from different distances. But if the original noise be a continued sound, a man's voice, for example, uttering a continued uniform tone, the first echo may reach the ear at the same moment with the second vibration of the larynx; the second echo along with the third vibration, and so on. It is evident, that this will produce the same effect. The only difference will be, that the articulations of the voice will be made indistinct, if the echoes come from very different distances. Thus if a man pronounce the syllable raw; and the ten successive echoes are made from places which are ten feet farther off, the tenth part of a second (nearly) will intervene between hearing the first and the last. This will give it the sound of the syllable thaw, or perhaps raw, because r is the repetition of t. Something like this occurs when, standing at one end of a long line of soldiers, we hear the muskets of the whole line discharged in one instant. It seems to us the sound of a running fire.\n\nThe aim therefore in the construction of a speaking trumpet may be, to cause as many echoes as possible to reach a distant ear without any perceptible interval of time. This will give distinctness, and something equivalent to loudness. Pure loudness arises from the violence of the single aerial undulation. To increase this may be the aim in the construction of a trumpet; but we are not sufficiently acquainted with the mechanism of these undulations to bring this about with certainty and precision; whereas we can procure this accumulation of echoes without much trouble, since we know that echoes are, in fact, reflected like light. We can form a trumpet so that many of these lines of reflected sound shall pass through the place of the hearer. We are indebted to Mr Lambert of Berlin for this simple and popular view of the subject; and shall here give an abstract of his most ingenious Dissertation on Acoustic Instruments, published in the Berlin Memoirs for 1763.\nTrumpet. Sound naturally spreads in all directions; but we know that echoes or reflected sounds proceed almost strictly in certain limited directions. If therefore we contrive a trumpet in such a way that the lines of echo shall be confined within a certain space, it is reasonable to suppose that the sound will become more audible in proportion as this diffusion is prevented. Therefore if we can oblige a sound which, in the open air, would have diffused itself over a hemisphere, to keep within a cone of 120 degrees, we should expect it to be twice as audible within this cone. This will be accomplished by making the reflections such that the lines of reflected sound shall be confined within this cone. N.B. We here suppose that nothing is lost in the reflection. Let us examine the effect of a cylindrical trumpet.\n\nLet the trumpet be a cylinder ABED (fig. 1.), and let C be a bounding point in the axis. It is evident that all the sound in the cone BCE will go forward without any reflection. Let CM be any other line of sound, which we may, for brevity's sake, call a sonorous or phonic line. Being reflected in the points M, N, O, P, it is evident that it will at last escape from the trumpet in a direction PQ, equally diverging from the axis with the line CM. The same must be true of every other sonorous line. Therefore the echoes will all diverge from the mouth of the trumpet in the same manner as they would have proceeded from C without any trumpet. Even supposing, therefore, that the echoes are as strong as the original sound, no advantage is gained by such a trumpet, but that of bringing the sound forward from C to c. This is quite trifling when the hearer is at a distance. Yet we see that sounds may be heard at a very great distance, at the end of long, narrow, cylindrical, or prismatical galleries. It is known that a voice may be distinctly heard at the distance of several hundred feet in the Roman aqueducts, whose sides are perfectly straight and smooth, being plastered with stucco. The smooth surface of the still water greatly contributes to this effect. Cylindrical or prismatical trumpets must therefore be rejected.\n\nLet the trumpet be a cone BCA (fig. 2.), of which CN is the axis, DK a line perpendicular to the axis, and DFHI the path of a reflected sound in the plane of the axis. The last angle of reflection IHA is equal to the last angle of incidence FHC. The angle BFH, or its equal CFD, is equal to the angles FHD and FCH; that is, the angle of incidence CFD exceeds the next angle of incidence FHC by the angle FCD; that is, by the angle of the cone. In like manner, FDH exceeds CFD by the same angle FCD. Thus every succeeding angle, either of incidence or reflection, exceeds the next by the angle of the cone. Call the angle of the cone \\(a\\), and let \\(b\\) be the first angle of incidence PDC. The second, or DFC, is \\(b-a\\). The third, or FHC, is \\(b-2a\\), &c.: and the \\(n\\)th angle of incidence or reflection is \\(b-na\\), after \\(n\\) reflections. Since the angle diminishes by equal quantities at each subsequent reflection, it is plain, that whatever be the first angle of incidence, it may be exhausted by this diminution; namely, when \\(n\\) times \\(a\\) exceeds or is equal to \\(b\\). Therefore to know how many reflections of a sound, whose first incidence has the inclination \\(b\\), can be made in an infinitely extended cone, whose angle is \\(a\\), divide \\(b\\) by \\(a\\); the quotient will give the number \\(n\\) of reflections, and the remainder, if any, will be the last angle of incidence or reflection less than \\(a\\). It is very plain, that when an angle of reflection IHA is equal to or less than the angle BCA of the cone, the reflected line HI will no more meet with the other side CB of the cone.\n\nWe may here observe, that the greatest angle of incidence is a right angle, or 90\u00b0. This sound would be reflected back in the same line, and would be incident on the opposite side in an angle =90\u00b0\u2014\\(a\\), &c.\n\nThus we see that a conical trumpet is well suited for confining the sound: for by prolonging it sufficiently, we can keep the lines of reflected sound wholly within the cone. And when it is not carried to such a length as to do this, when it allows the founding line GH, for example, to escape without farther reflection, the divergency from the axis is less than the last angle of reflection BGH by half the angle BCA of the cone. Let us see what is the connection between the length and the angle of ultimate reflection.\n\nWe have \\(\\frac{\\sin b}{\\sin a} : \\frac{\\sin b}{\\sin a} = CD : CF\\), and \\(CF = CD \\times \\frac{\\sin b}{\\sin a}\\), and \\(\\frac{\\sin b}{\\sin a} = \\frac{\\sin b}{\\sin a} = \\frac{\\sin b}{\\sin a} \\times \\frac{\\sin b}{\\sin a} = CD \\times \\frac{\\sin b}{\\sin a} \\times \\frac{\\sin b}{\\sin a} = CD \\times \\frac{\\sin b}{\\sin a} \\times \\frac{\\sin b}{\\sin a} = \\cdots\\)\n\nTherefore if we suppose X to be the length which will give us \\(n\\) reflections, we shall have \\(X = CD \\times \\frac{\\sin b}{\\sin a} \\times \\frac{\\sin b}{\\sin a} \\times \\cdots\\). Hence we see that the length increases as the angle \\(b-n\\) diminishes; but is not infinite, unless \\(n\\) is equal to \\(b\\). In this case, the immediately preceding angle of reflection must be \\(a\\), because these angles have the common difference \\(a\\). Therefore the last reflected sound was moving parallel to the opposite side of the cone, and cannot again meet it. But though we cannot assign the length which will give the \\(n\\)th reflection, we can give the length which will give the one immediately preceding, whose angle with the side of the cone is \\(a\\). Let \\(Y\\) be this length. We have \\(Y = CD \\times \\frac{\\sin b}{\\sin a}\\). This length will allow every line of sound to be reflected as often, saving once, as if the tube were infinitely long. For suppose a sonorous line to be traced backwards, as if a sound entered the tube in the direction \\(i-h\\), and were reflected in the points \\(h,f,d,b,D\\), the angles will be continually augmented by the constant angle \\(a\\). But this augmentation can never go farther than 90\u00b0+45\u00b0. For if it reaches that value at \\(D\\), for instance, the reflected line DK will be perpendicular to the axis CN; and the angle ADK will be equal to the angle DKB, and the sound will come out again. This remark is of importance on another account.\n\nNow suppose the cone to be cut off at \\(D\\) by a plane perpendicular to the axis, KD will be the diameter of its mouth-piece; and if we suppose a mouth completely occupying this circle, and every point of the circle to be sonorous, the reflected sounds will proceed from it in the same manner as light would from a flame which completely\nTrumpet completely occupies its area, and is reflected by the inside of the cone. The angle FDA will have the greatest possible fine when it is a right angle, and it never can be greater than ADK, which is \\(90^\\circ + \\frac{1}{2}a\\). And since between \\(90^\\circ + \\frac{1}{2}a\\) and \\(90^\\circ - \\frac{1}{2}a\\), there must fall some multiple of \\(a\\); call this multiple \\(b\\). Then, in order that every sound may be reflected as often as possible, having once, we must make the length of it \\(X = \\frac{CD \\times S_b}{S_a}\\).\n\nNow since the angle of the cone is never made very great, never exceeding 10 or 12 degrees, \\(b\\) can never differ from \\(90^\\circ\\) above a degree or two, and its fine cannot differ much from unity. Therefore \\(X\\) will be very nearly equal to \\(\\frac{CD}{S_a}\\) which is also very nearly equal to \\(\\frac{CD}{2S_a}\\); because \\(a\\) is small, and the fines of small arches are nearly equal and proportional to the arches themselves. There is even a small compensation of errors in this formula. For as the fine of \\(90^\\circ\\) is somewhat too large, which would give \\(X\\) too great, \\(2S_a\\) is also larger than the fine of \\(a\\). Thus let \\(a\\) be \\(12^\\circ\\); then the nearest multiple of \\(a\\) is \\(84\\) or \\(96^\\circ\\), both of which are as far removed as possible from \\(90^\\circ\\), and the error is as great as possible, and is nearly \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\)th of the whole.\n\nThis approximation gives us a very simple construction. Let CM be the required length of the trumpet, and draw ML perpendicular to the axis in O. It is evident that \\(S_a : rad. = MO : CM\\), and CM; or \\(X = \\frac{MO}{S_a} = \\frac{LM}{2S_a}\\) but \\(X = \\frac{CD}{2S_a}\\) and therefore LM is equal to CD.\n\nIf therefore the cone be of such a length, that its diameter at the mouth is equal to the length of the part cut off, every line of sound will have at least as many reflections, save one, as if the cone were infinitely long; and the last reflected line will either be parallel to the opposite side of the cone, or lie nearer the axis than this parallel; consequently such a cone will confine all the reflected sounds within, a cone whose angle is \\(2a\\), and will augment the found in the proportion of the spherical base of this cone to a complete hemispherical surface. Describe the circle DKT round C, and making DT an arch of \\(90^\\circ\\), draw the chord DT. Then since the circles described with the radii DK, DT, are equal to the spherical surfaces generated by the revolution of the arches DK and DKT round the axis CD, the sound will be condensed in the proportion of \\(DK^2\\) to \\(DT^2\\).\n\nThis appears to be the best general rule for constructing the instrument; for, to procure another reflection, the tube must be prodigiously lengthened, and we cannot suppose that one reflection more will add greatly to its power.\n\nIt appears, too, that the length depends chiefly on the angle of the cone; for the mouth piece may be considered as nearly a fixed quantity. It must be of a size to admit the mouth when speaking with force and without constraint. About an inch and a half may be fixed on for its diameter. When therefore we propose to confine the sound to a cone of twice the angle of the trumpet, the whole is determined by that angle. For since in this case LM is equal to CD, we have \\(DK : Trumpet = CD : CM\\) and \\(CM = \\frac{CD}{DK}\\).\n\nBut \\(2S_a : 1 = DK : CD\\), and \\(2S_a : 1 = CD : CM\\); therefore \\(4S_a : 1 = DK : CM\\),\n\nAnd \\(CM = \\frac{DK}{4S_a}\\), very nearly. And since DK is an inch and a half, we get the length in inches, counted from the apex of the cone \\(= \\frac{1}{3}S_a\\), or \\(\\frac{3}{2S_a}\\). From this we must cut off the part CD, which is \\(\\frac{DK}{S_a}\\), or very nearly \\(\\frac{DK}{S_a}\\), or \\(\\frac{3}{2S_a}\\), measured in inches, and we must make the mouth of the same width \\(\\frac{3}{2S_a}\\).\n\nOn the other hand, if the length of the trumpet is fixed on, we can determine the angle of the cone. For let the length (reckoned from C) be L; we have \\(2S_a = \\frac{3}{L}\\), or \\(S_a = \\frac{3}{2L}\\), and \\(S_a = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2L}}\\).\n\nThus let 6 feet or 72 inches be chosen for the length of the cone, we have \\(S_a = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{144}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{48}} = 0.14434\\), \\(= \\sin 8^\\circ 17'\\) for the angle of the cone; and the width at the mouth is \\(\\frac{3}{2S_a} = 10.4\\) inches. This being taken from 72, leaves 61.6 inches for the length of the trumpet.\n\nAnd since this trumpet confines the reflected sounds to a cone of \\(160^\\circ 34'\\), we have its magnifying power \\(= \\frac{DT^2}{DK^2} = \\frac{S_a \\cdot 45^\\circ}{S_a \\cdot 48^\\circ} = 96\\) nearly. It therefore condenses the sound about 96 times; and if the distribution were uniform, it would be heard \\(\\sqrt{96}\\), or nearly 10 times farther off. For the loudness of sounds is supposed to be inversely as the square of the distance from the centre of undulation.\n\nBut before we can pronounce with precision on the performance of a speaking trumpet, we must examine into the manner in which the reflected sounds are distributed over the space in which they are all confined.\n\nLet BKDA (fig. 3.) be the section of a conical trumpet by a plane through the axis; let C be the vertex of the cone, and CW its axis; let TKV be the section of a sphere, having its centre in the vertex of the cone; and let P be a sonorous point on the surface of the sphere, and \\(P_a\\) the path of a line of sound lying in the plane of the section.\n\nIn the great circle of the sphere take \\(KQ = KP\\), \\(DR = DQ\\), and \\(KS = KR\\). Draw QB; also draw Qd parallel to DA; and draw PB, Pd, PA.\n\nThen it is evident that all the lines drawn from P, within the cone APB, proceed without reflection, and are diffused as if no trumpet had been used.\nTrumpet.\n\n2. All the sonorous lines which fall from P on KB are reflected from it as if they had come from Q.\n\n3. All the sonorous lines between BP and AP have suffered but one reflection; for DN will no more meet DA' so as to be reflected again.\n\n4. All the lines which have been reflected from KB, and afterwards from DA, proceed as if they had come from R. For the lines reflected from KB proceed as if they had come from Q; and lines coming from Q and reflected by DA, proceed as if they had come from R. Therefore draw RAo, and also draw Rgm parallel to KB, and draw QcAg, Qbg, Pc, and Pb. Then,\n\n5. All the lines between bP and cP have been twice reflected.\n\nAgain, draw SBp, BR, rQ, SxA, Ryx, Qzy.\n\n6. All the lines between uP and zP have suffered three reflections.\n\nDraw the tangents TA1, VBv, crossing the axis in W.\n\n7. The whole sounds will be propagated within the cone vWt. For to every sonorous point in the line KD there corresponds a point similar to Q, regulating the first reflection from KB; and a point similar to R, regulating the second reflection from DA; and a point S regulating the third reflection from KB, &c. And similar points will be found regulating the first reflection from DA, the second from KB, and the third from DA, &c.; and lines drawn from all these through A and B must lie within the tangents TA and VB.\n\n8. Thus the centres of reflection of all the sonorous lines which lie in planes passing through the axis, will be found in the surface of this sphere; and it may be considered as a sonorous sphere, whose sounds first concentrate in W, and are then diffused in the cone vWt.\n\nIt may be demonstrated nearly in the same manner, that the sonorous lines which proceed from P, but not in the plane passing through the axis, also proceed, after various reflections, as if they had come from points in the surface of the same sphere. The only difference in the demonstration is, that the centres Q, R, S of the successive reflections are not in one plane, but in a spiral line winding round the surface of the sphere according to fixed laws. The foregoing conclusions are therefore general for all the sounds which come in all directions from every point in the area of the mouth-piece.\n\nThus it appears, that a conical trumpet is well fitted for increasing the force of sounds by diminishing their final divergence. For had the speaker's mouth been in the open air, the sounds which are now confined within the cone vWt would have been diffused over a hemisphere; and we see that prolonging the trumpet must confine the sounds still more, because this will make the angle BWA still smaller; a longer tube must also occasion more reflections, and consequently send more sonorous undulations to the ear at a distance placed within the cone vWt.\n\nWe have now obtained a very connected view of the whole effect of a conical trumpet. It is the same as if the whole segment TKDV were sounding, every part of it with an intensity proportional to the density of the points Q, R, S, &c., corresponding to the different points P of the mouth-piece. It is easy to see that this cannot be uniform, but must be much rarer towards the margin of the segment. It would require a good deal of diffusion to show the density of these fictitious founding points; and we shall content ourselves with giving a very palpable view of the distribution of the sonorous rays, or the density (to speak) of the echoes, in the different situations in which a hearer may be placed.\n\nWe may observe, in the mean time, that this substitution of a sounding sphere for the sounding mouth-piece has an exact parallel in Optics, by which it will be greatly illustrated. Suppose the cone BKDA (fig. 3.) Fig. 3. to be a tube polished in the inside, fixed in a wall Ba, perforated in BA, and that the mouth-piece DK is occupied completely by a flat flame. The effect of this on a spectator will be the same, if he is properly placed in the axis, as if he were looking at a flame as big as the whole sphere. This is very evident.\n\nIt is easy to see that the line lS is equal to the line lefaP; therefore the reflected sounds also come to the ear in the same moments as if they had come from their respective points on the surface of the substituted sphere. Unless, therefore, this sphere be enormously large, the distinctness of articulation will not be sensibly affected, because the interval between the arrival of the different echoes of the same sound will be insensible.\n\nOur limits oblige us to content ourselves with exhibiting this evident similarity of the progress of echo from the surface of this phonic sphere, to the progress of light from the same luminous sphere shining through a hole of which the diameter is AB. The direct investigation of the intensity of the sound in different directions and distances would take up much room, and give no clearer conception of the thing. The intensity of the sound in any point is precisely similar to the intensity of the illumination of the same point; and this is proportional to the portion of the luminous surface seen from this point through the hole directly, and to the square of the distance inversely. The intelligent reader will acquire a distinct conception of this matter from fig. 4., which represents the distribution of the sonorous lines, and by consequence the degree of loudness which may be expected in the different situations of the hearer.\n\nAs we have already observed, the effect of the cone of the trumpet is perfectly analogous to the reflection of light from a polished concave, conical mirror. Such an instrument would be equally fitted for illuminating a distant object. We imagine that these would be much more powerful than the spherical or even parabolic mirrors commonly used for this purpose. These last, having the candle in the focus, also send forward a cylinder of light of equal width with the mirror. But it is well known, that oblique reflections are prodigiously more vivid than those made at greater angles. Where the inclination of the reflected light to the plane of the mirror does not exceed eight or ten degrees, it reflects about three-fourths of the light which falls on it. But when the inclination is 8\u00b0, it does not reflect one-fourth part.\n\nWe may also observe, that the density of the reflected sounds by the conical trumpet ABC (fig. 4.) is precisely similar to that of the illumination produced by a luminous sphere TDV, shining through a hole AB. There will be a space circumscribed by the cone formed by the lines TB1 and VA1, which is uniformly illuminated by the whole sphere (or rather by the segment TDV), and on each side there is a space illuminated by\nTrumpet, a part of it only, and the illumination gradually decreases towards the borders. A spectator placed much out of the axis, and looking through the hole \\( AB \\), may not see the whole sphere. In like manner, he will not hear the whole sounding sphere: He may be so far from the axis as neither to see nor hear any part of it.\n\nAfflicting our imagination by this comparison, we perceive that beyond the point \\( w' \\) there is no place where all the reflected sounds are heard. Therefore, in order to preserve the magnifying power of the trumpet at any distance, it is necessary to make the mouth as wide as the sonorous sphere. Nay, even this would be an imperfect instrument, because its power would be confined to a very narrow space; and if it be not accurately pointed to the person listening, its power will be greatly diminished. And we may observe, by the way, that we derive from this circumstance a strong confirmation of the justness of Mr Lambert's principles; for the effects of speaking trumpets are really observed to be limited in the way here described.\u2014Parabolic trumpets have been made, and they fortify the sound not only in the cylindrical space in the direction of the axis, but also on each side of it, which should not have been the case had their effect depended only on the undulations formed by the parabola in planes perpendicular to the axis. But to proceed.\n\nLet \\( BCA \\) (fig. 5.) be the cone, \\( ED \\) the mouth-piece, \\( TEDV \\) the equivalent sonorous sphere, and \\( TBAV \\) the circumscribed cylinder. Then \\( CA \\) or \\( CB \\) is the length of cone that is necessary for maintaining the magnifying power at all distances. We have two conditions to be fulfilled. The diameter \\( ED \\) of the mouth-piece must be of a certain fixed magnitude, and the diameter \\( AB \\) of the outer end must be equal to that of the equivalent sonorous sphere. These conditions determine all the dimensions of the trumpet and its magnifying power. And, first, with respect to the dimensions of the trumpet.\n\nThe similarity of the triangles \\( ECG \\) and \\( BCF \\) gives \\( CG : ED = CF : AB \\); but \\( CG = BF = \\frac{1}{2} AB \\), and \\( CF = CG + GF = GF + \\frac{1}{2} AB \\); therefore \\( \\frac{1}{2} AB : ED = GF + \\frac{1}{2} AB : AB \\); and \\( AB : ED = 2GF + AB : AB \\); therefore \\( 2GF \\times ED + AB \\times ED = AB^2 \\), and \\( 2GF \\times ED = AB^2 - AB \\times ED = AB \\times AB - ED \\), and \\( GF = \\frac{AB \\times AB - ED}{2ED} \\). And, on the other hand,\n\nbecause \\( AB^2 - \\times EBA = 2GF \\times ED \\), we have \\( AB^2 - AB \\times ED + \\frac{1}{4} ED^2 = 2GF \\times ED + \\frac{1}{4} ED^2 \\), or \\( AB - \\frac{1}{2} ED^2 = 2GF \\times ED + \\frac{1}{4} ED^2 \\), and \\( AB = \\sqrt{2GF \\times ED + \\frac{1}{4} ED^2} + \\frac{1}{2} ED \\).\n\nLet \\( x \\) represent the length of the trumpet, \\( y \\) the diameter at the great end, and \\( m \\) the diameter of the mouth-piece. Then \\( x = \\frac{y \\times y - m}{2m} \\), and \\( y = \\sqrt{2x + \\frac{3}{4} m^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m} \\).\n\nThus the length and the great diameter may be had reciprocally. The useful case in practice is to find the diameter for a proposed length, which is gotten by the last equation.\n\nNow if we take all the dimensions in inches, and fix \\( m \\) at an inch and a half, we have \\( 2x + \\frac{3}{4} m^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m = 0.5625 \\), and \\( \\frac{1}{2} m = 0.75 \\); so that our equation becomes \\( y = \\sqrt{3x + 0.5625 + 0.75} \\). The following table gives the dimensions of a sufficient variety of trumpets. Trumpet.\n\nThe first column is the length of the trumpet in feet; the second column is the diameter of the mouth in inches; the third column is the number of times that it magnifies the sound; and the fourth column is the number of times that it increases the distance at which a man may be distinctly heard by its means; the fifth contains the angle of the cone.\n\n| GF feet | AB inches | Magnifying | Extending | ACB |\n|--------|-----------|------------|-----------|-----|\n| 1      | 6.8       | 42.6       | 6.5       | 24.53 |\n| 2      | 9.3       | 77.8       | 8.8       | 18.23 |\n| 3      | 11.2      | 112.4      | 10.6      | 15.18 |\n| 4      | 12.8      | 146.6      | 12.1      | 13.24 |\n| 5      | 14.2      | 180.4      | 13.4      | 12.04 |\n| 6      | 15.5      | 214.2      | 14.6      | 11.05 |\n| 7      | 16.6      | 247.7      | 15.7      | 10.18 |\n| 8      | 17.7      | 281.3      | 16.8      | 9.40  |\n| 9      | 18.8      | 314.6      | 17.7      | 9.08  |\n| 10     | 19.8      | 347.7      | 18.6      | 8.42  |\n| 11     | 20.7      | 380.9      | 19.5      | 8.18  |\n| 12     | 21.5      | 414.6      | 20.4      | 7.58  |\n| 15     | 24.1      | 513.6      | 22.7      | 7.09  |\n| 18     | 26.2      | 612.3      | 24.7      | 6.33  |\n| 21     | 28.3      | 711.2      | 26.6      | 6.05  |\n| 24     | 30.2      | 810.1      | 28.5      | 5.42  |\n\n\\( ED \\) in all is \\( = 1.5 \\)\n\nThe two last columns are constructed on the following considerations: We conceive the hearer placed within the cylindrical space whose diameter is \\( BA \\). In this situation he receives an echo coming apparently from the whole surface \\( TGV \\); and we account the effect of the trumpet as equivalent to the united voices of as many mouths as would cover this surface. Therefore the quotient obtained by dividing the surface of the hemisphere by that of the mouth-piece will express the magnifying power of the trumpet. If the chords \\( gE, gT \\) be drawn, we know that the spherical surfaces \\( TgV, EgD \\) are respectively equal to the circles described with the radii \\( Tg, Eg \\), and are therefore as \\( Tg^2 \\) and \\( Eg^2 \\). Therefore the audibility of the trumpet, when compared with a single voice, may be expressed by \\( Tg^2 : Eg^2 \\). Now the ratio of \\( Tg^2 \\) to \\( Eg^2 \\) is easily obtained.\n\nFor if \\( Ef \\) be drawn parallel to the axis, it is plain that \\( \\frac{BA - ED}{2} \\), and that \\( Ef \\) is to \\( fB \\) as radius to the tangent of \\( BCF \\); which angle we may call \\( a \\).\n\nThen tan \\( a = \\frac{y - m}{2x} \\), and thus we obtain the angle \\( a \\). But if the radius \\( CE \\) be accounted \\( i \\), \\( Tg \\) is \\( = \\sqrt{z} \\), and \\( Eg \\) is \\( = 2 \\sin \\frac{a}{2} \\). Therefore \\( \\frac{Tg}{Eg} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2 \\sin \\frac{a}{2}} \\), and the magnifying power of the trumpet is \\( = \\frac{2}{4 \\sin \\frac{a}{2}} \\).\nThe numbers, therefore, in the third column of the table are each \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nBut the more usual way of conceiving the power of the trumpet is, by considering how much farther it will enable us to hear a voice equally well. Now we suppose that the audibility of sounds varies in the inverse duplicate ratio of the distance. Therefore if the distance \\( d \\), at which a man may be distinctly heard, be increased to \\( z \\), in the proportion of \\( EG \\) to \\( TG \\), the sound will be less audible, in the proportion of \\( TG^2 \\) to \\( EG^2 \\). Therefore the trumpet will be as well heard at the distance \\( z \\) as the simple voice is heard at the distance \\( d \\).\n\nTherefore \\( \\frac{z}{d} \\) will express the extending power of the trumpet, which is therefore \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\). In this manner were the numbers computed for the fourth column of the table.\n\nWhen the angle BCA is small, which is always the case in speaking trumpets, we may, without any sensible error, consider \\( EG \\) as \\( \\frac{ED}{2} = \\frac{m}{2} \\). And \\( TG = TC \\times \\sqrt{2} = \\frac{AB}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{y}{\\sqrt{2}} \\). This gives a very easy computation of the extending and magnifying powers of the trumpet.\n\nThe extending power is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\frac{y}{m} \\).\n\nThe magnifying power is \\( \\frac{y^2}{m^2} \\).\n\nWe may also easily deduce from the premises, that if the mouth-piece be an inch and a half in diameter, and the length \\( x \\) be measured in inches, the extending power is very nearly \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}x} \\) and the magnifying power \\( \\frac{3}{4}x \\).\n\nAn inconvenience still attends the trumpet of this construction. Its complete audibility is confined to the cylindrical space in the direction of the axis, and it is more faintly heard on each side of it. This obliges us to direct the trumpet very exactly to the spot where we wish it to be heard. This is confirmed by all the accounts we have of the performance of great speaking trumpets. It is evident, that by lengthening the trumpet, and therefore enlarging its mouth, we make the lines TB and VA expand (fig. 4); and therefore it will not be so difficult to direct the trumpet.\n\nBut even this is confined within the limits of a few degrees. Even if the trumpet were continued without end, the sounds cannot be reinforced in a wider space than the cone of the trumpet. But it is always advantageous to increase its length; for this makes the extreme tangents embrace a greater portion of the sonorous sphere, and thus increases the sound in the space where it is all reflected. And the limiting tangents TB, VA, expand still more, and thus the space of full effect is increased. But either of these augmentations is very small in comparison of the augmentation of size. If the trumpet of fig. 5, were made an hundred times longer, its Trumpet power would not be increased one half.\n\nWe need not therefore aim at much more than to produce a cylindrical space of full effect; and this will always be done by the preceding rules, or table of constructions. We may give the trumpet a third or a fourth part more length, in order to spread a little the space of its full effect, and thereby make it more easily directed to the intended object. But in doing this we must be careful to increase the diameter of the mouth as much as we increase the length; otherwise we produce the very opposite effect, and make the trumpet greatly inferior to a shorter one, at all distances beyond a certain point. For by increasing the length while the part CG remains the same, we cause the tangents TB and VA to meet on some distant point, beyond which the sound diffuses prodigiously. The construction of a speaking trumpet is therefore a problem of some nicety; and as the trials are always made at some considerable distance, it may frequently happen that a trumpet which is not heard at a mile's distance, may be made very audible two miles off by cutting off a piece at its wide end.\n\nAfter this minute consideration of the conical trumpet, we might proceed to consider those of other forms. In particular, the hyperbolic, proposed by Caffegrain, and the parabolic, proposed by Haase, seem to merit consideration. But if we examine them merely as reflectors of echoes, we shall find them inferior to the conical.\n\nWith respect to the hyperbolic trumpet, its inaptitude is evident at first sight. For it must dissipate the echoes more than a conical trumpet. Indeed Mr Caffegrain proceeds on quite different principles, depending on the mechanism of the aerial undulations: his aim was to increase the agitation in each pulse, so that it may make a more forcible impulse on the ear. But we are too imperfectly acquainted with this subject to decide a priori; and experience shows that the hyperbola is not a good form.\n\nWith respect to the parabolic trumpet, it is certain that if the mouth-piece were but a point, it would produce the most favourable reflection of all the sounds; for they would all proceed parallel to the axis. But every point of an open mouth must be considered as a centre of sound, and none of it must be kept out of the trumpet. If this be all admitted, it will be found that a conical trumpet, made by the preceding rules, will dissipate the reflected sounds much less than the parabolic.\n\nThus far have we proceeded on the fair consequences of the well known fact, that echoes are reflected in the same manner as light, without engaging in the intricate investigation of aerial undulations. Whoever considers the Newtonian theory of the propagation of sound with intelligence and attention, will see that it is demonstrated solely in the case of a single row of particles; and that all the general corollaries respecting the lateral diffusion of the elastic undulations are little more than fagacious guesses, every way worthy of the illusrious author, and beautifully confirmed by what we can most distinctly and accurately observe in the circular waves on the surface of still water. But they are by no means fit for becoming the foundation of any doctrine which lays the smallest claim to the title of accurate science. We really know\nTrumpet know exceedingly little of the theory of aerial undulations; and the conformity of the phenomena found to these gueffes of Sir Isaac Newton has always been a matter of wonder to every eminent and candid mathematician: and no other should pretend to judge of the matter. This wonder has always been acknowledged by Daniel Bernoulli; and he is the only person who has made any addition to the science of sounds that is worth mentioning. For such we must always esteem his doctrine of the secondary undulations of musical cords, and the secondary pulses of air in pipes. Nothing therefore is more unwarrantable, or more plainly shows the precipitant presumption of modern scientists, than the familiar use of the general theory of aerial undulations in their attempts to explain the abstruse phenomena of nature (such as the communication of sensation from the organ to the sensorium by the vibrations of a nervous fluid, the reciprocal communication of the volitions from the sensorium to the muscle, nay, the whole phenomena of mind), by vibrations and vibratilucula.\n\nSuch attempts equally betray ignorance, presumption, and meanness of soul. Ignorance of the extent to which the Newtonian theory may be logically carried, is the necessary consequence of ignorance of the theory itself. It is presumption to apply it to the phenomena of the intellectual world; and surely he has an abject soul who hags and cherishes the humble thought, that his mind is an undulating fluid, and that its all-grasping comprehension, and all its delightful emotions, are nothing more than an ethereal tune.\u2014\"Pol me occiditis amantes.\" This whim is older than Hartley: it may be found in Robinet's Syst\u00e8me de la Nature. This by the bye made its first appearance as a discourse delivered by Brother Orateur in the lodge of the grand Orient at Lyons; from which source have proceeded all the cosmopolitan societies in Europe, and that illumination by which reason is to triumph over revelation, and liberty and equality over civil government. We crave pardon of our readers for this ebullition of feeling; and we hope for it from all those who can read Newton, and who esteem his modelly.\n\nThose who have endeavoured to improve the speaking trumpet on mechanical principles, have generally aimed at increasing the violence of the elastic undulations, that they may make a more forcible impulse on the ear. This is the object in view in the parabolic trumpet. All the undulations are converted into others which are in planes perpendicular to the axis of the instrument; so that the same little mass of air is agitated again and again in the same direction. From this it is obvious to conclude, that the total agitation will be more violent. But, in the first place, these violent agitations must diffuse themselves laterally as soon as they get out of the trumpet, and thus be weakened, in a proportion that is perhaps impossible for the most expert analyst to determine. But, moreover, we are not sufficiently acquainted with the mechanism of the very first agitations, to be able to perceive what conformation of the trumpet will cause the reflected undulations to increase the first undulations, or to check them. For it must happen, during the production of a continued sound in a trumpet, that a parcel of air, which is in a state of progressive agitation, as it makes a pulse of one sound, may be in a state of retrograde agitation, as it is part of a pulse of air producing another sound. We cannot (at least no mathematician has yet done it) discriminate, and then combine these agitations, with the intelligence and precision that are necessary for enabling us to lay what is the ultimate accumulated effect. Mr Lambert therefore did wisely in abating from this intricate investigation; and we are highly obliged to him for deducing such a body of demonstrable doctrine from the acknowledged, but ill understood, fact of the reflection of echoes.\n\nWe know that two sounds actually cross each other without any mutual disturbance; for we can hear either of them distinctly, provided the other is not so loud as to stun our ears, in the same manner as the glare of the sun dazzles our eyes. We may therefore depend on all the consequences which are legitimately deduced from this fact, in the same manner as we depend on the science of catoptrics, which is all deduced from a fact perfectly similar and as little understood.\n\nBut the preceding propositions by no means explain or comprehend all the reinforcement of sound which is really obtained by means of a speaking trumpet. In the first place, although we cannot tell in what degree the aerial undulations are increased, we cannot doubt that the reflections which are made in directions which do not greatly deviate from the axis, do really increase the agitation of the particles of air. We see a thing perfectly similar to this in the waves on water. Take a long slip of lead, about two inches broad, and having bent it into the form of a parabola, set it into a large flat trough, in which the water is about an inch deep. Let a quick succession of small drops of water fall precisely on the focus of the parabola. We shall see the circular waves proceeding from the focus all converted into waves perpendicular to the axis, and we shall frequently see these straight waves considerably augmented in their height and force. We say generally, for we have sometimes observed that these reflected waves were not sensibly stronger than the circular or original waves. We do not exactly know to what this difference must be ascribed: we are disposed to attribute it to the frequency of the drops. This may be such, that the interval of time between each drop is precisely equal, or at least commensurable, to the time in which the waves run over their own breadth. This is a pretty experiment; and the ingenious mechanician may make others of the same kind which will greatly illustrate several difficult points in the science of sounds. We may conclude, in general, that the reflection of sounds, in a trumpet of the usual shape, is accompanied by a real increase of the aerial agitations; and in some particular cases we find the sounds prodigiously increased. Thus, when we blow through a musical trumpet, and allow the air to take that uniform undulation which can be best maintained in it, namely, that which produces its musical tone, where the whole tube contains but one or two undulations, the agitation of a particle must then be very great; and it must describe a very considerable line in its oscillations. When we put our blast in such a manner as to continue this note, that is, this undulation, we are certain that the subsequent agitations conspire with the preceding agitation, and augment it. And accordingly we find that the sound is increased to a prodigious degree. A cor de chasse, or a bugle horn, when properly winded, will almost deafen the ear; and yet the exertion is a mere nothing in comparison with what we make when bellowing with all\nTrumpet.\n\nour force, but with not the tenth part of the noise. We also know, that if we speak through a speaking trumpet in the key which corresponds with its dimensions, it is much more audible than when we speak in a different pitch. These observations show, that the loudness of a speaking trumpet arises from something more than the sole reflection of echoes considered by Mr Lambert\u2014the very echoes are rendered louder.\n\nIn the next place, the sounds are increased by the vibrations of the trumpet itself. The elastic matter of the trumpet is thrown into tremors by the undulations which proceed from the mouth-piece. These tremors produce pulses in the contiguous air, both in the inside of the trumpet and on that which surrounds it. These undulations within the trumpet produce original sounds, which are added to the reflected sounds: for the tremor continues for some little time, perhaps the time of three or four or more pulses. This must increase the loudness of the subsequent pulses. We cannot say to what degree, because we do not know the force of the tremor which the part of the trumpet acquires: but we know that these sounds will not be magnified by the trumpet to the same degree as if they had come from the mouth-piece; for they are reflected as if they had come from the surface of a sphere which passes through the agitated point of the trumpet. In short, they are magnified only by that part of the trumpet which lies without them. The whole sounds of this kind, therefore, proceed as if they came from a number of concentric spherical surfaces, or from a solid sphere, whose diameter is twice the length of the trumpet cone.\n\nAll these agitations arising from the tremors of the trumpet tend greatly to hurt the distinctness of articulation; because, coming from different points of a large sphere, they arrive at the ear in a sensible succession; and thus change a momentary articulation to a lengthened sound, and give the appearance of a number of voices uttering the same words in succession. It is in this way, that, when we clap our hands together near a long rail, we get an echo from each post, which produces a chirping sound of some continuance. For these reasons it is found advantageous to check all tremors of the trumpet by wrapping it up in woollen linings. This is also necessary in the musical trumpet.\n\nWith respect to the undulations produced by the tremors of the trumpet in the air contiguous to its outside, they also hurt the articulation. At any rate, this is so much of the sonorous momentum uselessly employed; because they are diffused like common sounds, and receive no augmentation from the trumpet.\n\nIt is evident, that this instrument may be used (and accordingly was so) for aiding the hearing; for the sonorous lines are reflected in either direction. We know that all tapering cavities greatly increase external noises; and we observe the brutes prick up their ears when they want to hear uncertain or faint sounds. They turn them in such directions as are best suited for the reflection of the sound from the quarter whence the animal imagines that it comes.\n\nLet us apply Mr Lambert's principle to this very interesting case, and examine whether it be possible to assist dull hearing in like manner as the optician has assisted imperfect sight.\n\nThe subject is greatly simplified by the circumstances of the case; for the sounds to which we listen generally come in nearly one direction, and all that we have to do is to produce a constipation of them. And we may conclude, that the audibility will be proportional to this constipation.\n\nTherefore let ACB, fig. 6, be the cone, and CD its axis. The sound may be conceived as coming in the direction RA, parallel to the axis, and to be reflected in the points A, b, c, d, e, till the angle of incidence increases to 90\u00b0; after which the subsequent reflections find the sound out again. We must therefore cut off a part of the cone; and, because the lines increase their angle of incidence at each reflection, it will be proper to make the angle of the cone an aliquot part of 90\u00b0, that the least incidence may amount precisely to that quantity. What part of the cone should be cut off may be determined by the former principles. Call the angle ACD, a. We have \\( C = \\frac{CA \\cdot \\text{fin.} a}{\\text{fin.}(2n+1)a} \\), when the sound gets the last useful reflection. Then we have the diameter of the mouth \\( AR = 2 \\cdot CA \\cdot \\text{fin.} a \\), and that of the other end \\( ef = C \\cdot \\text{fin.} a \\). Therefore the sounds will be constituted in the ratio of \\( CA^2 \\) to \\( C^2 \\), and the trumpet will bring the speaker nearer in the ratio of \\( CA \\) to \\( C \\).\n\nWhen the lines of reflected sound are thus brought together, they may be received into a small pipe perfectly cylindrical, which may be inserted into the external ear. This will not change their angles of inclination to the axis nor their density. It may be convenient to make the internal diameter of this pipe \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\) of an inch. Therefore \\( C \\cdot \\text{fin.} a = \\frac{7}{8} \\) of an inch. This circumstance, in conjunction with the magnifying power proposed, determines the other dimensions of the hearing trumpet. For \\( C = \\frac{1}{6 \\cdot \\text{fin.} a} = \\frac{CA \\cdot \\text{fin.} a}{\\text{fin.}(2n+1)a} \\), and \\( CA = \\frac{\\text{fin.}(2n+1)a}{6 \\cdot \\text{fin.} a} \\).\n\nThus the relation of the angle of the cone and the length of the instrument is ascertained, and the sound is brought nearer in the ratio of \\( CA \\) to \\( C \\), or of \\( \\text{fin.}(2n+1)a \\) to \\( \\text{fin.} a \\). And seeing that we found it proper to make \\( (2n+1)a = 90\u00b0 \\), we obtain this very simple analogy, \\( 1 : \\text{fin.} a = CA : C \\). And the fine of \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\) the angle of the cone is to radius as 1 to the approximating power of the instrument.\n\nThus let it be required that the sound may be as audible as if the voice were 12 times nearer. This gives \\( CA = 12 \\). This gives \\( \\text{fin.} a = \\frac{1}{12} \\), and \\( a = 4\u00b047' \\); and the angle of the cone \\( = 9.34 \\). Then \\( CA = \\frac{1}{6 \\cdot \\text{fin.} a} = \\frac{1}{6 \\cdot \\text{fin.} a} = \\frac{144}{6} = 24 \\). Therefore the length of the cone is 24 inches. From this take \\( C = \\frac{CA}{12} = 2 \\), and the length of the trumpet is 22 inches. The diameter at the mouth is \\( 2 \\cdot C = 4 \\) inches. With this instrument one voice should be as loud as 144.\n\nIf it were required to approximate the sound only four times, making it 16 times stronger than the natural voice.\nTrumpet voice at the same distance, the angle ACB must be $29^\\circ$; AE must be 2 inches, AB must be $\\frac{1}{4}$ inches, and EF must be $\\frac{1}{4}$ of an inch.\n\nIt is easy to see, that when the size of the ear-end is the same in all, the diameters at the outer end are proportional to the approximating powers, and the lengths of the cones are proportional to the magnifying powers.\n\nWe shall find the parabolic conoid the preferable shape for an acoustic trumpet; because the sounds come into the instrument in a direction parallel to the axis, they are reflected so as to pass through the focus. The parabolic conoid must therefore be cut off through the focus, that the sounds may not go out again by the subsequent reflections; and they must be received into a cylindrical pipe of one-third of an inch in diameter. Therefore the parameter of this parabola is one-sixth of an inch, and the focus is one-twelfth of an inch from the vertex. This determines the whole instrument; for they are all portions of one parabolic conoid. Suppose that the instrument is required to approximate the sound 12 times, as in the example of the conical instrument. The ordinate at the mouth must be 12 times the sixth of an inch, or 2 inches; and the mouth diameter is four inches, as in the conical instrument. Then, for the length, observe, that DC in fig. 7, is $\\frac{3}{4}$ of an inch, and MP is 2 inches, and AC is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of an inch, and DC : MP = AC : AP. This will give AP = 12 inches, and CP = 11$\\frac{1}{2}$ inches; whereas in the conical tube it was 22. In like manner an instrument which approximates the sound four times, is only $\\frac{1}{4}$ inches long, and $\\frac{1}{4}$ inches diameter at the big end. Such small instruments may be very exactly made in the parabolic form, and are certainly preferable to the conical. But since even these are of a very moderate size when intended to approximate the sound only a few times, and as they can be accurately made by any tinman, they may be of more general use. One of 12 inches long, and 3 inches wide at the big end, should approximate the sound at least 9 times.\n\nA general rule for making them.\u2014Let m express the approximating power intended for the instrument. The length of the instrument in inches is $\\frac{m \\times m - 1}{6}$, and the diameter at the mouth is $\\frac{m}{3}$. The diameter at the small end is always one-third of an inch.\n\nIn trumpets for afflicting the hearing, all reverberation of the trumpet must be avoided. It must be made thick, of the least elastic materials, and covered with cloth externally. For all reverberation lasts for a short time, and produces new sounds which mix with those that are coming in.\n\nWe must also observe, that no acoustic trumpet can separate those sounds to which we listen from others that are made in the same direction. All are received by it, and magnified in the same proportion. This is frequently a very great inconvenience.\n\nThere is also another imperfection, which we imagine cannot be removed, namely, an odd confusion, which cannot be called indistinctness, but a feeling as if we were in the midst of an echoing room. The cause seems to be this: Hearing gives us some perception of the direction of the sounding object, not indeed very precise, but sufficiently so for most purposes. In all instruments Trumpets, which we have described for containing sounds, the last reflections are made in directions very much inclined to the axis, and inclined in many different degrees. Therefore they have the appearance of coming from different quarters; and instead of the perception of a single speaker, we have that of a sounding surface of great extent. We do not know any method of preventing this, and at the same time increasing the sound.\n\nThere is an observation which it is of importance to make on this theory of acoustic instruments. Their performance does not seem to correspond to the computations founded on the theory. When they are tried, we cannot think that they magnify so much: Indeed it is not easy to find a measure by which we can estimate the degrees of audibility. When a man speaks to us at the distance of a yard, and then at the distance of two yards, we can hardly think that there is any difference in the loudness; though theory says, that it is four times less in the last of the two experiments; and we cannot but adhere to the theory in this very simple case, and must attribute the difference to the impossibility of measuring the loudness of sounds with precision. And because we are familiarly acquainted with the sound, we can no more think it four times less at twice the distance, than we can think the visible appearance of a man four times less when he is at quadruple distance. Yet we can completely convince ourselves of this, by observing that he covers the appearance of four men at that distance. We cannot easily make the same experiment with voices.\n\nBut, besides this, we have compared two hearing trumpets, one of which should have made a sound as audible at the distance of 40 feet as the other did at 10 feet distance; but we thought them equal at the distance of 40 and 18. The result was the same in many trials made by different persons, and in different circumstances. This leads us to suspect some mistake in Mr. Lambert's principle of calculation; and we think him mistaken in the manner of estimating the intensity of the reflected sounds. He conceives the proportion of intensity of the simple voice and of the trumpet to be the same with that of the surface of the mouth-piece to the surface of the sonorous hemisphere, which he has so ingeniously substituted for the trumpet. But this seems to suppose, that the whole surface, generated by the revolution of the quadrant arch TEG round the axis CG (fig. 4.), is equally sonorous. We are assured that it is not: For even if we should suppose that each of the points Q, R, and S (fig. 3.), are equally sonorous with the point P, these points of reflection do not stand so dense on the surface of the sphere as on the surface of the mouth-piece. Suppose them arranged at equal distances all over the mouth-piece, they will be at equal distances also on the sphere, only in the direction of the arches of great circles which pass through the centre of the mouth-piece. But in the direction perpendicular to this, in the circumference of small circles, having the centre of the mouth-piece for their pole, they must be rarer in the proportion of the sine of their distance from this pole. This is certainly the case with respect to all such sounds as have been reflected in the planes which pass through the axis of the trumpet; and we do not see (for we have not examined this point) that any compensation is made by the reflection which is not in planes.\nplanes passing through the axis. We therefore imagine, that the trumpet does not increase the sound in the proportion of \\( gE^2 \\) to \\( gT^2 \\) (fig. 5.), but in that of \\( \\frac{gE}{GE} \\) to \\( \\frac{gT}{CT} \\).\n\nMr Lambert seems aware of some error in his calculation, and proposes another, which leads nearly to this conclusion, but founded on a principle which we do not think in the least applicable to the case of sounds.\n\n**Trumpet, Marine,** is a musical instrument consisting of three tables, which form its triangular body. It has a very long neck with one single string, very thick, mounted on a bridge, which is firm on one side, but tremulous on the other. It is struck by a bow with one hand, and with the other the string is pressed or stopped on the neck by the thumb.\n\nIt is the trembling of the bridge, when struck, that makes it imitate the sound of a trumpet, which it does to that perfection, that it is scarcely possible to distinguish the one from the other. And this is what has given it the denomination of trumpet-marine, though, in propriety, it be a kind of monochord. Of the six divisions marked on the neck of the instrument, the first makes a fifth with the open chord, the second an octave, and so on for the rest, corresponding with the intervals of the military trumpet.\n\n**Trumpet-Flower.** See **Bignonia**, Botany Index.\n\n**Trumpeter.** See **Psophia**, Ornithology Index.\n\n**Truncated,** in general, is an appellation given to such things as have, or seem to have, their points cut off: thus, we say, a truncated cone, pyramid, leaf, &c.\n\n**Truncheon,** a short staff or baton used by kings, generals, and great officers, as a mark of their command.\n\n**Trundle,** a sort of carriage with low wheels, whereon heavy and cumbersome burdens are drawn.\n\n**Trunk,** among botanists, that part of the herb which arises immediately from the root, and is terminated by fructification; the leaves, buds, and auxiliary parts of the herb not entering in its description.\n\n**Trunnions,** or **Trunions,** of a piece of ordnance, are those knobs or bunches of metal which bear her up on the cheeks of the carriage.\n\n**Truss,** a bundle, or certain quantity of hay, straw, &c.

It is seated on the point of the gulf of Goletta, about eight miles from the place where the city of Carthage stood. It is in the form of a long square, and is about four miles in circumference, with ten large streets, five gates, and 35 mosques. The houses are all built with stone, though but one story high; but the walls are very lofty, and flanked with several strong towers. It has neither ditches nor bastions, but a good citadel, built on an eminence on the west side of the city. It is said to contain 300,000 inhabitants, of whom 30,000 are Jews. The divan, or council of state, assembles in an old palace; and the dey is the chief of the republic, who resides there. The harbour of Tunis has a very narrow entrance, through a small canal. In the city they have no water but what is kept in cisterns, except one well kept for the bailaw's use. It is a place of great trade, and is 10 miles from the sea. E. Long. 10\u00b0 16' N. Lat. 36\u00b0 42'.\n\nTunis, a country of Africa, bounded on the north and east by the Mediterranean sea and the kingdom of Tripoli, on the south by several tribes of the Arabs, and on the west by the kingdom of Algiers and the country of Elab; being 300 miles in length from east to west, and 250 in breadth from north to south. This country was formerly a monarchy; but a difference arising between a king and his son, one of whom was for the protection of the Christians, and the other for that of the Turks, in 1574 the inhabitants shook off the yoke of both. From this time it became a republic under the protection of the Turks, and pays a certain tribute to the bailaw who resides at Tunis. The air in general is healthy; but the soil in the eastern parts is indifferent for want of water. Towards the middle the mountains and valleys abound in fruits; but the western part is the most fertile, because it is watered with rivers.\n\nThe environs of Tunis are very dry, upon which account corn is generally dear. The inroads of the Arabs oblige the inhabitants to sow their barley and rye in the suburbs, and to inclose their gardens with walls. However, there are plenty of citrons, lemons, oranges, dates, grapes, and other fruits. There are also olive trees, roses, and odoriferous plants. In the woods and mountains there are lions, wild beesves, ostriches, monkeys, cameleons, roebucks, hares, pheasants, partridges, and other sorts of birds and beasts. The most remarkable rivers are the Guadalcarbar, Magrada, Magerada, and Caps. The form of government is aristocratic; that is, by a council, whose president is the dey; not unlike the doge of Venice. The members of the divan or council are chosen by the dey, and he in his turn is elected by the divan; which is composed of soldiers, who have more than once taken off the dey's head. The bailaw is a Turk, residing at Tunis; whose business is to receive the tribute, and protect the republic; the common revenues are only 400,000 crowns a-year, because the people are very poor; nor can they send above 40,000 men into the field; nor more than 12 men of war of the line to sea, even upon the most extraordinary occasions. There are generally about 12,000 Christian slaves in this country; and the inhabitants carry on a great trade in linen and woollen cloth. In the city of Tunis alone there are above 3000 clothiers and weavers. They also have a trade in horses, olives, oil, soap, ostriches eggs and feathers. The Mahometans of this city have nine colleges for students, and 86 petty schools. The principal religion is Mahometanism; but the inhabitants consist of Moors, Turks, Arabs, Jews, and Christian slaves. However the Turks, though fewest, in number, domineer over the Moors, and treat them little better than slaves.\n\nTunkers, a religious sect of Baptists in Pennsylvania, so called from the word tunker, to put a morsel in sauce.

His father was a long time provost of the corporation of merchants; during which he was the object of general admiration, on account of his prudent administration. M. Turgot was the youngest of three brothers, and was destined for the church. He had scarcely attained the age at which reflection commences, when he resolved to sacrifice all temporal advantages to liberty and conscience, and to pursue his ecclesiastical studies without declaring his repugnance to their proposed object. At the age of 23 years he took his degree, and was elected prior of the Sorbonne.\n\nThe time when it was necessary for him to declare that he would not be an ecclesiastic was now arrived. He announced this resolution to his father by letter, showing the motives which induced him to decline the clerical order. His father consented, and he was appointed matter of requits. M. Turgot prepared himself for this office by particular application to those parts of science which are most connected with its functions and duties, viz. natural philosophy, agriculture, manufactures, commerce, &c. About this period he wrote some articles for the Encyclop\u00e9die, of which the principal are Etymology, Existence, Expandibility, Fair, and Foundation. He had prepared several others, but the persecution against the Encyclop\u00e9die induced him to decline farther contributions.\n\nIn 1761 M. Turgot was appointed intendant of Limoges, when he gave activity to the society of agriculture; opened a mode of public instruction for female professors of midwifery; procured for the people the attendance of able physicians during the raging of epidemic diseases; established houses of industry, supported by charity (the only species of alms-giving which does not encourage idleness); introduced the cultivation of potatoes into his province, &c. &c. While M. Turgot proceeded with unremitting activity and zeal, in promoting the good of the people over whom he was placed, he meditated projects of a more extensive nature, such as an equal distribution of the taxes, the construction of the roads, the regulation of the militia, the prevention of a scarcity of provision, and the protection of commerce.\n\nAt the death of Louis XV. the public voice called M. Turgot to the first offices of government, as a man who united the experience resulting from habits of business to all the improvement which study can procure. After being at the head of the marine department only a short time, he was, August 24, 1774, appointed comptroller general of the finances. During his discharge of this important office, the operations he carried on are astonishing. He suppressed 23 kinds of duties on necessary occupations, useless contracts, or merited compensations. He abolished the corv\u00e9e, or the labour required from the public for the highways, saving the nation thirty millions of livres annually.\u2014He set aside another kind of corv\u00e9e, which respected the carriage of military stores and baggage.\u2014He abated the rigour in the administration of indirect impositions, to the great profit of the contributors, the king, and the financiers; beside many other essential improvements in political economy.\n\nAt length, however, by the artifices of the courtiers, he was deprived of his offices; and in retirement he devoted himself to the sciences and the belles lettres, which he had cultivated in his youth. Natural philosophy and chemistry were his favourite pursuits; sometimes he indulged in poetry. He composed, it is said, only one Latin verse, intended for a picture of Dr Franklin.\n\nEripuit calo fulmen, mox fecit tyrannis.\"\n\nHe died in 1781.","sp":122,"ep":122},{"h":"TURIN","t":"an ancient and populous city of Italy, and capital of Piedmont, where the sovereign resides, with an archbishop's see, a strong citadel, and an university.

It is bounded on the north by the empire of Russia, Hungary, and the Black sea; on the west by the gulf of Venice and the Mediterranean; on the south by the Mediterranean and Arabia; and on the east by Persia. In its present state, we may compute it as extending from the river Unna, in east longitude about 17\u00b0, to the mountains which separate it from Persia, in about 50\u00b0 of east longitude from Greenwich, or about 33\u00b0 from west to east; while from the most southerly point, a little above Baflora, in north latitude 31\u00b0, to the confines of European Russia, in north latitude 47\u00b0, it occupies a range of 16\u00b0 of latitude. In British miles its extent is estimated at 1750 in length, by a medial breadth of about 1000, and its area at 652,960 square miles.\n\nTurkey is naturally divided into European and Asiatic, separated from each other by the Black sea, the Archipelago, and the straits by which these are connected. European Turkey is subdivided into 11 provinces, viz., Moldavia, Bessarabia, Wallachia, Bosnia, Servia (partially), Bulgaria, Romelia (including Macedonia and Thrace), Dalmatia, Albania (including Epirus), Croatia (partially), and the Morea, or ancient Greece; while Asiatic Turkey is subdivided into seven provinces, viz., Natolia (Asia Minor), Diarbek (Mesopotamia), Syria (including Judea), Georgia (Iberia), Turcomania (Armenia), Irac-Arabia, and Kurdistan (Assyria). See each of these articles in the general alphabet.\n\nThe islands belonging to Turkey are extremely numerous; comprising those of the Archipelago, or the Grecian islands, and several in the Levant. The most important are Lemnos, Lesbos or Mytilene, Scio, Samos, Cos, Rhodes, Cyprus, Candia, Paros, Delos, Naxia, Sanctorini, Patmos, Negropont, Andros*, Colteri or Salami*, Egina, Zante*, Cephalonia, Leucadia, Corfu, and Cerigo or Cythera, which see under their proper heads.\n\nBoth European and Asiatic Turkey abound in mountainous tracts, interspersed with numerous plains and valleys, and here and there a desert of considerable extent. The plains are watered by numerous large rivers, and, in the Asiatic part, consist chiefly of pasture grounds.\n\nAmong the mountains of European Turkey may be noticed the Carpathian chain, which divides it from the Austrian territories; the celebrated mountains of Haemus; the Acroceranian mountains; and the classical hills of Pindus, Ossa, Pelios, and Athos. The most important mountains of Asiatic Turkey are, Mount Caucasus, dividing it from Russia; Mount Taurus, now called Thuron; Olympus; Ida; the mountains of Elend, and perhaps Mount Ararat, the resting-place of the Ark, dividing it from Persia; and Mount Lebanon, celebrated in scripture for its cedars.\n\nThe principal river of European Turkey is the Danube, with its tributary streams, the Save, the Morava, the Bofna, and the Pruth; but we may also notice the Marilia or Hebrus, and the Vardan or Axius. In Asiatic Turkey are seen the Kifil-Irmak or Halys, the Sacaria, the Sarabat or Hermus, the Minder or Meander, the Araxes, the Orontes, the Jordan, and the Euphrates.\n\nThe lakes of European Turkey are of little importance, and in the Asiatic part there are only three that merit notice. These are the Dead sea and the sea of Galilee in Palestine, and the Van in Armenia.\n\nThe climate in the greater part of the Turkish empire is delightful, and the seasons mild and genial. The heats of the summer, except in the deserts of Syria, and on the shores of the Black sea, are tempered by the keen winds that blow from the higher regions, and the winter is in general extremely mild. The unhealthiness of the large towns on the coast of Asiatic Turkey, is owing much more to the indolent and dirty habits of the people, than to any infalibility of the climate.\n\nTurkey affords a most ample field to the naturalist, whether his taste lead him to explore the animal, the history, vegetable, or the mineral kingdom. In the first of these he will find the lion, a variety of the tiger, the hyena, the jackal, the ibex, the goat and cat of Angora, and many other quadrupeds common in Europe. Among the birds, one of the most numerous and most useful is the stork; partridges of a large size, quails, woodcocks, cranes, and several birds of prey, are also very common. The Black sea and the Archipelago abound with excellent fish, and contain great variety of curious mollusca, and other marine animals. Among the insects, that destructive animal the locust is a frequent visitant's, and Sonnini particularizes the tarantula, and a monstrous species of spider, which he calls galeode araneoides, or the scorpion spider. Of the domestic animals, the Turks abound in excellent horses, asses of a large size, and that most useful beast of burden, the camel.\n\nTo enumerate the vegetable productions of Turkey, would far exceed our scanty limits. The forests of European Turkey, though far less extensive than in ancient times, furnish abundance of the finest timber, especially oak, cedar, larch, walnut, chestnut, and beech, while the olive, the date, the almond, the peach, the mulberry, the cherry, the lemon, and the orange, are the natural productions of Asiatic Turkey. Many of the most valuable drugs employed in medicine, are also the produce of this empire, especially opium, rhubarb, myrrh, asafoetida and other fetid gums, scammony, fennel, galls, and coloquintida.\nBoth gold and silver mines are found in Turkey, but from the indolence of the natives they are scarcely ever worked. Many of the islands abound in mineral treasures, especially Cyprus, where are found mines of gold, copper, vitriol, and iron; and where rock crystal, jasper, and several precious stones are occasionally procured. The chief mineral production of Turkey, however, is its marble, of which it furnishes several of the most rare and beautiful varieties. That from the Grecian island Paros, is proverbially excellent.\n\nThe people whom we now call Turks, and who form the great mass of population of the Turkish empire, are generally believed to be the descendants of the ancient Scythians. They are supposed to have migrated from the Altai mountains in Tartary, about the middle of the fifth century, and to have gradually diffused themselves towards the west, till they reached the lake Maeotis, the modern sea of Azof, near which they settled in Armenia Minor or Turcomania. At this time the Roman empire in the east was sufficiently strong to prevent the invaders from extending beyond the river Oxus, on the banks of which they established themselves, and soon became a formidable foe to the emperors of Constantinople.\n\nThere is little certain or interesting in the history of these barbarians till the reign of the caliph Othman, or Ofan, who in the end of the 13th century established what from him has been called the Ottoman empire. He first took the title of sultan, and fixed the seat of his government at Prusa, the capital of Bithynia. His successor Orkan was a restless, ambitious, and cruel prince, who greatly extended the limits of the empire, took possession of Gallipoli, and penetrated into Thrace. Amurath the grandson of Ofan, in 1362, established the famous military bands called janissaries, which still form the chief engines and chief moderators of Turkish despotism. These were first composed of young Christian slaves that had been taken in war, and educated in the Mohammedan religion. They were inured to obedience by severe discipline, and trained to warlike exercises; and as every sentiment which enthusiasm can inspire, and every mark of honour which the favour of the prince could confer, were employed to animate them with martial ardour, and excite in them a sense of their own importance, these janissaries, (or new soldiers) soon became the chief strength and pride of the Ottoman arms. On the assassination of Amurath in 1389, he was succeeded by his son Bajazet, furred named Ildirim, or the Thunderbolt, whose reign forms one of the most splendid epochs in the Turkish history.\n\nEarly in this reign, viz., in 1396, the Hungarians were defeated at Nicopolis in Bulgaria, and in 1402, was fought the famous battle between Bajazet and Timur or Tamerlane, the chief of the Moguls, between Cesarea and Aneyra, which ended in the captivity of Bajazet, and the temporary humiliation of the Turks. See MOGULS, No. 19 and 20.\n\nOn the death of Bajazet, his son Moufa became sultan, and in 1412 defeated the emperor Sigismund with great slaughter. Moufa was succeeded by his brother Mohammed I., by whom he had been affianced. The reign of Amurath II., successor of Mohammed, contributed greatly to increase the splendour of the Turkish empire. In this reign Constantinople was attacked, but for the present escaped pillage. Amurath was successfully opposed in his hostilities against the Christian princes, by the Albanian chief George Castrion, whom the Turks call Scanderbeg.\n\nAmurath was succeeded by Mohammed II., and soon after his accession, viz., in 1453, the city of Constantinople was taken by the Turks, and has ever since remained the capital of their empire. The events of which we have thus drawn the faint outline, are related at some length in the article CONSTANTINOPOLITAN HISTORY, No. 111.\u2014168.\n\nThree years after the taking of Constantinople, Mohammed laid siege to Belgrade, from which, after an attempt of obstinate resistance, he was at length repulsed with considerable loss. Abandoning his attempt on Hungary, the sultan made preparations for an expedition into Greece, where the princes Thomas and Demetrius, brothers of the emperor, still continued to maintain their authority. Alarmed at the progress of the Turkish arms, these princes resolved on retiring into Italy, on which the peninsula was seized by the Albanians. This tribe sent a deputation to Mohammed, offering to give up to him the Grecian cities and fortresses, provided they should be allowed to keep the open country; but this offer was rejected by the sultan, who under the appearance of assailing the Greeks, entered the country with a formidable army, defeated the Albanians, took several cities, and carried off great numbers of the inhabitants.\n\nMohammed was succeeded by his second son Bajazet II., in 1481, preferred by the janizaries to his elder brother Zizan, who fled for protection to Pope Alexander VI., by whom he is said to have been poisoned, at the instigation of Bajazet, and for the reward of 300,000 ducats. Selim, his youngest son and successor, was a successful prince. He conquered Egypt, Aleppo, Antioch, Tripoli, Damascus, and Gaza, and defeated the Persians. Solyman, furred named the Magnificent, one of the most accomplished, enterprising, and warlike, of the Turkish princes, ascended the Ottoman throne in consequence of the death of Selim.\n\nHaving quelled some insurrections in Asia, he commenced hostilities against the European princes, and entering Hungary, made himself master of Belgrade, then reckoned the chief barrier of that kingdom against the Turkish power. He next turned his victorious arms against the island of Rhodes, then the seat of the knights of St John of Jerusalem. After incredible efforts of courage and military conduct, the knights obtained an honourable capitulation, and retired to the small island of Malta, where they fixed their residence. See MALTA. He afterwards annexed Hungary to the Ottoman empire. His dominions extended from Algiers to the river Euphrates, and from the farther end of the Black Sea to the extremity of Greece and Epirus. During the siege of Sigeth, a city of Hungary, before which the Turks lost above 30,000 men, Solyman expired in the 74th year of his age, and 41st of his reign.\n\nHis son and successor, Selim II., besieged and took Selim II., Cyprus; but in the famous sea fight at Lepanto, in 1571, the Turkish fleet was utterly destroyed by Don John of Austria. He afterwards invested and took Tunis by storm, putting the garrison to the sword.\n\nOn his death, Amurath III., ascended the Ottoman throne, and extended his dominions on both sides by the addition of Raab in Hungary, and Tigris in Persia. His son, Mohammed III., has no claim to notice except...\nTurkey except on account of his barbarity. He began his reign by strangling 19 of his brothers, and ordering 12 of his father's wives, whom he suspected to be pregnant, to be drowned. This monster of cruelty had, however, a successful reign of nine years duration. During the government of his son, Achmet I., the affairs of Turkey underwent a material change for the worse*. On his death, the janizaries and the divan elected his brother Multapha, whom in two months they declared incapable of reigning, and threw him into prison; after this they proclaimed his young nephew, Olman, the son of Achmet, emperor. This prince formed a design of curbing the power of the janizaries, for which he was deposed and murdered; and Multapha was again called from his prison to the imperial throne, but was soon after strangled.\n\nUnder Amurat, or Morad IV., surnamed Gasi, the Intrepid, everything again assumed a new appearance. He was successful in his wars, and took Bagdad from the Persians. A debauch of wine put an end to his life, and dishonoured his memory. His son Ibrahim, who succeeded him, had every vice; he was a weak prince, and wholly destitute of courage. He was strangled by four mutes.\n\nAfter a long interval of inactivity, the Turks again became formidable to Europe, under Mohammed IV., who succeeded him. His grand vizier Kupuli, who at once directed the councils and conducted the armies of the Porte, took Candia from the Venetians. After carrying on many wars against the Germans, the Poles, the Ruffians, and other European powers, he was compelled to resign the turban to Soliman II. in 1687, a prince happy in his domestic government, but unsuccessful in his wars. His brother, Achmet II., was likewise unfortunate in his wars. In his reign the Turks were driven out of Hungary and Transylvania\u2020. The accession of his nephew, Multapha II., to the Ottoman throne, gave a new turn to the affairs of the Porte. Possessed of more vigour than his predecessor, he resolved to command his troops in person. He accordingly took the field, passed the Danube, stormed Lippa, seized Itul, and falling suddenly on a body of Imperialists, under Veterani, he killed that officer, dispersed his forces, and closed with success the campaign. He was afterwards defeated by Prince Eugene in an uncommonly bloody battle at Zenta, a small village on the western bank of the Thuyfe, in the kingdom of Hungary. About 20,000 Turks were left dead on the field, and 10,000 were drowned in the river, endeavouring to avoid the fury of the sword. The magnificent pavilion of the sultan, and all the stores, fell into the hands of Prince Eugene, and soon after this misfortune the haughty Multapha was dethroned.\n\nHis brother and successor, Achmet III., gave an asylum to Charles XII., king of Sweden, at Bender, a Turkish town in Moldavia, after his defeat at the battle of Pultava. (See Russia, No. 118, and Sweden, No. 140.) Being unsuccessful in his war against Koul Khan and the Persians (see Persia), he was deposed, and succeeded by Mohammed V.\n\nFrom the deposition of Achmet III. till the accession of Multapha III. in 1754, nothing of importance occurs in the history of the Turkish empire. During the reign of this latter sultan was begun and terminated that destructive war with Russia, of which the principal events have been enumerated in the article Russia, No. 143 and 144.\n\nIn this reign an extraordinary alarm was excited in Turkey by the sudden appearance of a new prophet in Upper Asia. This man, whose name was Shiek Manjour, pretended that he was predestined by the eternal immutable decrees of heaven to fill up the measure of divine revelation to mankind; and that, as he was to be the last, so he was the greatest of the prophets. The scene of his ministry was in the wide and desolate regions on the borders of the Caspian sea; and though the first rumour of his proceedings represented him as at the head of a multitude of armed enthusiasts, ready to overturn the established government, and the religion of Mohammed, it was soon discovered that all the military fury of his zeal was directed against the Christians.\n\nAbout the same time a formidable rebellion broke out in Egypt, which, though it has never properly formed a part of the Turkish empire, may be considered as tributary to the Turks, and as constituting the granary of that empire. This rebellion, which has been sufficiently noticed under the article Egypt, No. 125, was suppressed chiefly by the wise conduct and intrepid bravery of Hoffsan Bey, the captain pacha, who at the age of 70, fought with all the ardour of youth, and all the skill of the most consummate general. That veteran, however, was recalled before he was able to carry all his patriotic designs into execution, that he might aid the divan with his council, in the critical situation into which the empire was brought by the arrogant claims of the court of Russia. The result of the deliberations was a precipitate declaration of war against that court, contrary to the better judgement of the old pacha. The war commenced in autumn 1787, and the hordes of Tartars which were first brought into the field, headed by the new prophet, were everywhere defeated by the superior discipline of the Russian troops commanded by Prince Potemkin. Some enterprises which were undertaken by the Turks against the island of Tannan and the Crimea were attended with as little success as the attempts of the Tartars; while the emperor Joseph declared to the Porte, that he would assist his ally the empress of Russia with an army of 80,000 men. Four Austrian armies were accordingly assembled; one at Carlstadt in Croatia, under the command of General de Vins; another at Petervaradin in Hungary, commanded by General Langlois; a third on the borders of Lithuania, under General Febris; and the fourth in the Bucovine, under the orders of the prince of Saxe-Cobourg. Two other generals, 10 lieutenant-generals, and 30 major-generals, were all ordered to prepare for active service in the frontier armies.\n\nThe war between the Turks and Austrians was carried on with various success. At first the advantage was evidently on the side of the Ottomans, and the imperial Joseph acquired no warlike renown. His declared purpose was to get possession of Belgrade; from which, however, he was repulsed with disgrace. The prince of Saxe-Cobourg in his department of the war displayed indeed prodigies of valour; but being opposed to a superior force, he was long obliged to act only on the defensive. At length being joined by a body of Russian forces under General Soltikof, preparations were made for commencing in form the siege of Choczin, which was surrendered to the allied armies on Michaelmas.\nTurkey. mas day 1788, after a defence which would have done honour to the ablest general in Europe. Still, however, success seemed to lean to the Turks. The grand vizier made a sudden incursion into the Banat, and spread consternation and dismay to the very gates of Vienna. The Austrian affairs seemed approaching to a very alarming crisis; not only the splendid views of conquest which were beheld in the imagined partition of a tottering empire had totally disappeared, but had left in their place the sad and gloomy reverse of a discontented and impoverished people, an exhausted treasury, and an army thinned by pestilence and desertion. The first campaign of an invasive war had already produced an impression on the territory of the invader.\n\nIn this situation of affairs Marshal Laudohn was with some difficulty drawn from his retirement to take the command of the army in Croatia; and under his auspices fortune began to smile on the Austrian arms. He quickly reduced Dubicza and Nevi, though they were both defended by the most obstinate bravery. He then sat down before Turkish Gradica; but the autumnal rains coming on with such violence, that the Save overflowed its banks, he was compelled to raise the siege. During this period the war in the Banat raged with the utmost violence; torrents of blood were shed on both sides; much desperate valor displayed on the one side, and many brave actions performed on the other; while a very great part of that fine but unfortunate country suffered all the desolation and ruin that fire and sword, under the dominion of vengeance and animosity, could inflict. The inhabitants were objects of commiseration; but the injustice with which the emperor had commenced the war, made his personal losses be considered as nothing more than the due reward of his conduct.\n\nIn the midst of these military operations Achmet IV. was deposed, and succeeded by Selim III. the late sultan. The new emperor did not want either courage or prudence, and he continued the war with Russia and Austria, with great spirit and resolution. Those events of this war in which the Russians were more immediately concerned, have been already noticed under the article RUSSIA, No. 156, 158, 160 and 161; so that we have merely to relate the remaining operations of the Austrians.\n\nMarshal Laudohn renewed his attempts upon Gradica as soon as the season would permit, and after a brave defence it fell into his hands. This, with some other successes routed the emperor from his inactivity, and made him seriously determine on the attack which he had long meditated on Belgrade. The enterprise was intrusted to Laudohn, who, with that good fortune which seemed constantly to attend him, made himself master of the place in less than a month. The rest of the campaign was little else than a series of the most important successes. While one detachment of General Laudohn's forces took possession of Czernitz in Wallachia, another made itself master of Cladova in Serbia. Bucharest, the capital of the former of these provinces, fell without opposition into the hands of Prince Cobourg; while Akerman on the Black Sea was reduced by the Russians; and Bender surrendered to Prince Potemkin, not without suspicion of sinister practices, on the 15th of November.\n\nSoon after this, the emperor Joseph died, and his successor Leopold shewed a desire for peace. After the reduction of Orsova, therefore, which happened on the 16th of April 1790, the war was carried on with languor on the part of Austria; and in the month of June a conference was agreed on at Reichenbach, at which the ministers of Prussia, Austria, Britain, and the United Provinces, assisted, and at which also an envoy from Poland was occasionally present. After a negotiation, which continued till the 17th of August, it was agreed that a peace should be concluded between the king of Hungary and the Ottoman Porte; that the basis of this treaty should be a general surrender of all the conquests made by the former, retaining only Choczm as a security till the Porte should accede to the terms of the agreement, when it also was to be restored.\n\nIn the following year the Porte was compelled to conclude a peace with the empress of Russia, and from that period till the deposition of Selim in 1807, no event of consequence has occurred. The Porte has alternately been at war with Britain and with France, but in neither contest has the acquired either honour or territory. As the very confined limits to which we are now reduced forbid us to dwell on these minor transactions, we shall hasten to conclude this historical outline with an account of the revolution which placed Mahomet IV. on the Ottoman empire.\n\nIn the spring 1807, the spirit of insurrection had shown itself among the janizaries belonging to the garrisons of the Dardanelles, and in the camp of the grand vizier. In the afternoon of the 25th of May, the garrisons of the castles of the Dardanelles were in a state of tumult, on account of the European uniform, the new and accelerated tactics, &c. Hali Aga, the commandant of Madchidja-fon of Muburna, on the Asiatic shore, was murdered. Indche-fasha IV. Bey, commandant of the entrance of the Black Sea, only escaped the same fate by flight. The reis effendi happening to come to inspect that post just at the same time, the military immediately rose upon him as one of the introducers of the nizam geded. He endeavoured to save himself in a bark, by passing over to Buyukdere, but 100 pistol shots laid him and his attendants dead. It seems that the rage of the janizaries had been embittered against him by the recollection of a promise he made to raise their pay, on condition they would adopt the new discipline, and which promise he never performed.\n\nAnother circumstance increased the spirit of opposition; the sultan had given notice that the janizaries were no longer to attend him as usual to the mosque, but that this duty was to devolve upon the troops disciplined after the European manner. Thousands of janizaries were now marching to Constantinople, and arrived in the suburb of Pera on the evening of the 28th. They swore to each other to conduct the revolution with the best order. Any person who should in the least injure any Frank was to suffer death. One individual janizary only met with his fate, for taking bread from a Greek (a baker), without paying for it. Behind the janizaries barracks, in the well-known place called Eimeldan, the janizaries planted their colours, and took with them their camp kettles; an infallible signal of insurrection. For a time, the sultan thought of defending himself; and troops, powder, and cannon, were brought to the seraglio. Soon after the mufti, the feimen bache, the kaimakan, and the two kazeakars of Romelia and Natolia, joined the janizaries.\nTurkey. zaries. A council was held in form, and it was pro-\nposed as a preliminary, to request the grand seignior\nto abolish the new discipline by a fetwa from the mufti.\nThe grand seignior, however, thought he should be able\nto put a stop to the insurrection before the step could\nbe taken, in consequence of his sending the heads of\nMahmud, Terfana Emin, Hagai Ibrahim, and the\nkiaga Mehmed Effendi, to the Eimeldan. This\nmeasure completely failed; the janizaries were more\nenraged than ever; they did not require the heads of\nthe universally esteemed Mahmud Effendi, but that of\nthe Reis Effendi, then in the camp of the grand vizier.\n\nThe janizaries continued to search every place for\nthose ministers, who had promoted the adoption of the\nEuropean discipline, and publicly avowed themselves as\nits patrons, namely, Fransito, Ibrahim, Jusuf Aga,\nHadlchi Ibrahim, and Achmet Bey, captains of the grand\nseignior's guard; Haffan Aga, Achmet Effendi, and\nothers, 12 in number, who were all taken, dragged to the\nEimeldan, and there cut to pieces. At this juncture the\ngrand seignior sent a hatti icherif, a letter written in\nhis own hand, in which he for ever abolished the nizam\ngeded, and pronounced an execration on it. But the\nhatti icherif was not now accepted; the deposition of\nthe grand seignior was resolved on. The whole force\nof the janizaries now proceeded to the feraglio. The\nmufti and the ullemas alone entered the haram, while\nthe rest of the ministers, the agas, the janizaries, and the\npeople, surrounded the palace.\n\nMultapha IV., born on the 7th of September 1799,\nthe eldest son of the sultan Achmet IV., set aside in\n1789, was raised to the Turkish throne. And accord-\ning to ancient custom, Selim, the former sultan, threw\nhimself at the feet of Multapha, kissed the border of his\ngarment, and immediately repaired to that department\nof the feraglio occupied by the princes of the Ottoman\nblood who no longer reign. The solemn invitation to\nMultapha, to ascend the throne, was made on the 26th\nof May, and on the 3rd of June the ceremony of invest-\ning him with the fabric of the prophet, took place.\n\nThe population of the whole Turkish empire is usu-\nally estimated at 18,000,000. Of these, 10,000,000\nhave been allotted to Asiatic Turkey, and the remain-\ning 8,000,000 to Turkey in Europe. A considerable\npart of this population consists of Jews and mercantile\nChristians, from different parts of Europe, who are dis-\ntinguished by the name of Franks.\n\nThe government of Turkey is despotic, but the\npower of the sultan is by no means so absolute as we\nare generally led to suppose. Besides, being strictly\nsubject to the laws of the Koran, and thus to the na-\ntional religion, such obstructions to his absolute will are\nraised by the power of the mufti, or chief priest and judge,\nby the frequent insurrections of the janizaries, and the\nambition of the pachas, or governors of provinces, that\nmany Christian sovereigns are much more despotic.\nThe principal title of the sultans is, as we have seen,\ngrand seignior, and the court of Constantinople is usu-\nally styled the Porte, or Ottoman Porte, either from the\nlarge gate at the entrance of the feraglio, or, what is\nmore probable, from the palace of the vizier, where all\nthe affairs of state are transacted. The principal mini-\nsters of the Porte are the grand vizier or prime minister,\nthe mufti, the reis effendi or chief secretary of state,\n\nthe kiflar-aga or chief of the black eunuchs, and the\naga of the janizaries.\n\nThe revenues of the whole Turkish empire are com-\nputed at about 7,000,000 Sterling, while the usual ex-\npense does not exceed 5,000,000. This revenue is partly\nderived from the capitation tax on unbelievers and from\nthe customs, but principally from the tax on land, a-\nmounting to about 6s. per acre. The sultan is also\nsupposed to possess a considerable private treasure, but\nof this nothing certain is known.\n\nThe military strength of Turkey is but inconside ra-\nble for so large an empire. The whole of the land forces\nare supposed never to exceed 150,000 men, and these\nare ill disciplined, and now dispirited by successive\ndisastrous wars. The navy is estimated at 30 sail of the\nline; but the ships are ill-built, badly manned, and wretch-\nedly navigated. In short, the military strength of the\nOttoman empire is not improperly said to be more de-\nstructive to its own provinces than to any state with\nwhich they are at war, and more terrible to its friends\nthan its enemies.\n\nThe established religion of Turkey is Mahometanism,\nthe tenets of which have been already explained under\nlaws, the articles Mahometanism and Alcoran. The\nlaws of the empire are entirely founded on the Koran;\nbut in particular cases the judges are guided by certain\ncommentaries on that work, which have acquired the\nforce of laws. The chief of these are the commentaries\nof Abou-Hanife.\n\nThe mufti, or Mohammedan pontiff, resides at Con-\nstantinople, but his power has seldom interfered with the\ncivil government. Next to him in rank are the moul-\nlahs, who, though esteemed dignitaries of the church,\nare in fact rather doctors of the law, while the Koran is\nalso a code of civil observance. From the mollahs\nare selected the inferior muftis or judges throughout the\nempire, and the cadielquiers, or chief justices. The\nnext class of divines includes the imams, or parish\npriests, who perform the service of the mosques, while\nthe cadis are judges annually appointed to administer\njustice in the towns and villages, and being regard-\ned as churchmen, like the mollahs, have directed their\nchief attention to the judicial part of the Ko-\nran. From this brief view it will be observed, that\nthe ecclesiastical orders of muftis and imams somewhat\nresemble the Christian bishops and parochial clergy;\nwhile the other distinctions arise from the singularity\nof both religion and laws being united in the Koran, so\nthat a lawyer or judge must be at the same time a skil-\nful divine. The Turks have also their monks, styled\ndervishes, of four various orders and institutions, dedi-\ncated by solemn vows to religious offices, public prayer,\nand preaching. The Greeks, along with their faith,\nretain their priests, bishops, archbishops, and patriarchs;\nbut their church is in the last state of degradation,\nand its dignities openly sold by the Turks; this abomi-\nnation, however, it must be confessed, partly arises from\nthe miserable ambition and avarice of the Greek ec-\nclesiastics, who think they can atone by idle ceremo-\nnies for the neglect of all the invaluable morality of the\ngospel.\n\nThe Turkish language is of far inferior reputation\nLanguage and litera-\nture.\nTurkey.\n\nLiterature, however, is not wholly neglected, and it has been repeatedly attempted to establish a printing press at Constantinople; but the design failed from the interest of the copyists, who inferred that this art would deprive them of their bread. A late traveller informs us that there are in this capital several kuttub-chans, or public libraries, among which are those of St Sophia, and the Soliman Janiay; but none are so elegant as that founded by the grand vizier Raghid, which is wholly built of marble in the midst of a square court, and is filled with books chiefly theological. A librarian constantly attends, and there are convenient seats with carpets and cushions. In the neighbourhood is a school founded by the same vizier, in which about 120 boys are taught to read and write. The market for books is extensive, containing many shops well supplied with oriental manuscripts. The Turks have their ancient poets, historians, and divines; but of little reputation when compared with those of Persia or Arabia. The state of education among the Turks may be conceived to be very low, and ignorance is indeed a chief part of the national character. The only profession which requires a shadow of learning is that of the law, which is intimately connected with their theology. The celebrated doctors have disciples, who are trained up to that department; but there seems nothing that can deserve the name of college or university.\n\nThe Turks cannot be regarded as a commercial people, though they admit of an extensive commercial intercourse with the states of Europe, through the medium of Frank and Greek merchants. The chief ports are Smyrna and Constantinople, the former of which is the great centre of the Levant trade, while the latter is concerned chiefly in the trade with Russia, by the Black Sea. At both these ports, and indeed throughout the Turkish empire, the trade is nominally carried on by factors from the different European states; but it is managed more immediately by Jew or Armenian brokers, who take numerous advantages of the ignorance of the factors, and seldom fail to enrich themselves at the expense of their employers. The commodities exported from Turkey, chiefly to Britain, Germany, Italy, Holland, and France, consist for the most part of bees wax, boxwood, silk, cotton yarn, walnut planks, sponges, opium and other drugs enumerated in No. 9, madder root, and other dye stuffs, and various dried fruits, such as figs, raisins, and currants. The imports are chiefly tin and tin plates, sugar, shallows, cotton yarn and cotton goods, muslins, clocks and watches, cutlery and glass ware, indigo, gunpowder, pistols and military stores, logwood, rum, coffee, and various spices, especially pepper, ginger, and cinnamon. The exports are principally from Smyrna, where the trade is carried on almost entirely by way of exchange, while at Constantinople the imports are generally paid for by cash or bills. The exchange is commonly against the Turks.\n\nThe Turkish money usually employed in commerce is the piastre, which, according to the exchange or agio, is rated at from 13 to 17 in the English pound sterling, so that the average value of the piastre is about \u00a36. Each piastre is divided into 40 paras, and each para into three alpers. The principal weight employed is the kilo, equal to about one cwt. English, divided into 44 oke, and each oke into 400 drahm.\n\nFrom their jealousy with respect to strangers, it is extremely difficult to form a true estimate of the national character of the Turks. An intelligent writer, who seems well qualified to direct our judgement in this respect, has thus delineated the Turkish character. \"The Turks are in general a sagacious, thinking people; in the pursuit of their own interest, or fortune, their attention is fixed on one object, and they persevere with great steadfastness until they attain their purpose. They are in common life seemingly obliging and humane, not without appearances of gratitude; perhaps all or either of these, when extended towards Christians, are practised with a view of some advantage. Interest is their supreme good; where that becomes an object of competition, all attachment of friendship, all ties of consanguinity, are dissolved; they become delusive, no barrier can stop their pursuit, or abate their rancour towards their competitors. In their demeanour they are rather hypochondriac, grave, sedate, and passive; but when agitated by passion, furious, raging, ungovernable; big with distillation; jealous, suspicious, and vindictive beyond conception; perpetuating revenge from generation to generation. In matters of religion, tenacious, supercilious, and morose.\"\n\nThe manners and customs of the Turks are distinguished by the peculiarity of their religion from those of other European nations. On the birth of a child, the father himself gives the name, putting at the same time a grain of salt into its mouth. The circumcision is not performed till the age of 12 or 14. Marriage is only a civil contract, which either party may break, and is managed by female mediation, the youth seldom seeing his bride till after the ceremony. The dead are perfumed and covered with incense, and buried in a cloth, open at top and bottom, that the deceased may be able to fit up and answer the questions of the angels of death. The burial-grounds are near the highways, and stones are often placed at the heads of the graves, with carved turbans denoting the sex. As they never intrude upon a former grave, the cemeteries are very extensive. In diet the Turks are extremely moderate, and their meals are dispatched with great haste. Rice is the favourite food, and is dressed in three ways. In boiling, the meat is cut into small pieces, and in roasting till smaller, a bit of meat and an onion being placed alternately on a very long spit. The fish of the Archipelago are excellent, and the beef tolerable, except that of the buffalo, which is very hard. The hares, partridges, and other game, are of superior flavour. The meal is usually spread on a low wooden table, and the matter of the house pronounces a short prayer. The frugal repast is followed by fruits and cold water, which are succeeded by hot coffee and pipes with tobacco. The houses of the Turks are seldom expensive; the chief furniture is the carpet which covers the floor, with a low sofa on one side of the room. In regard to dress, Tournefort observes that the use of the turban is unhealthy. The shirt is of calico, and the loose robe is fastened by a girdle, in which is stuck a dagger, while the tobacco box, pocket-book, &c., are worn in the bosom. The robe is generally of European broad cloth, trimmed with various furs. The shoes or slippers are slight, and unfit for much exercise. The dress of the women differs little from that of the men, the chief distinction being the head-dress; that of the fair sex consisting of a bonnet like...\nTurkey like an inverted basket, formed of pasteboard covered with cloth of gold, with a veil extending to the eyebrows, while a fine handkerchief conceals the under part of the face. The personal cleanliness of both sexes is highly laudable; but the European eye is not pleased with the female custom of staining the nails with a red tincture. The amusements of the Turks partake of their indolent apathy, if we except hunting, and those of a military description. To recline on an elegant carpet, or in a hot seat by the side of a stream, and smoke the delicate tobacco of Syria, may be regarded as their chief amusement. Chess and draughts are favourite games; but those of chance are considered as incompatible with strict morals. The coffee-houses and baths furnish other sources of amusement; and the bairam, or festival which follows their long lent, is a season of universal dissipation.*\n\nIt appears to be a mistaken notion, that the practice of eating opium, to procure intoxication, is general among the Turks. We are assured by a late traveller, that this practice is confined to a few individuals, who are regarded by the majority of their countrymen with as much contempt as drunkards are in the more polished societies of Europe.\n\nTurkey.

See Chrysomela, Entomology Index.\n\nTurning, the art of forming hard bodies, as wood, ivory, iron, into a round or oval shape, by means of a machine called a lathe.\n\nThis art was well known to the ancients, and seems to have been carried by them to a very great degree of perfection; at least, if we believe the testimony of Pliny and several other authors, who tell us, that those precious vases enriched with figures in half-relief, which still adorn our cabinets, were turned on the lathe.\n\nThe art of turning is of considerable importance, as it contributes essentially to the perfection of many other arts. The architect uses it for many ornaments, both within and without highly finished houses. The mathematician, the astronomer, and the natural philosopher, have recourse to it, not only to embellish their instruments, but also to give them the necessary dimension and precision. In short, it is an art absolutely necessary to the goldsmith, the watchmaker, the joiner, the smith.\n\nTurning is performed by the lathe, of which there are various kinds, and several instruments, as gouges, chisels, drills, formers, screw tales, used for cutting what is to be turned into its proper form as the lathe turns round. The following is a simple kind of lathe (fig. 1), in which a is the footstool, b the cord, c the frame of the lathe, d d the puppets, e e the points, f the spanging-tree.\n\nThe lathe should be fixed in a place very well lighted; it should be immovable, and neither too high nor too low. The puppets should neither be so low as to oblige the workman to stoop in order to see his work properly, nor so high that the little chips, which he is continually driving off, should come into his eyes.\n\nThe piece to be turned should be rounded (if it be wood) before it be put on the lathe, either with a small hatchet made for the purpose, or with a plane, or with a file, fixing it in a vice, and having it down till it is everywhere almost of an equal thickness, and leaving it a little bigger than it is intended to be when finished off. Before putting it on the lathe, it is also necessary to find the centres of its two end surfaces, and that they should be exactly opposite to each other, that when the points of the puppets are applied to them, and the piece is turned round, no side may belly out more than another.\n\nTo find these two centres, lay the piece of wood to be turned upon a plank; open a pair of compasses to almost half the thickness of the piece; fix one of the legs in the plank, and let the point of the other touch one of the ends of the piece, brought into the same plane with the plank on which the compasses is fixed and very near the fixed leg. Describe four arches on that end at equal distances from each other at the circumference of the end, but intersecting one another within; the point of intersection is the centre of the end. In the same manner mark the centre of the other end be found. After finding the two centres, make a small hole at each of them, into which insert the points of the puppets, and fix the piece so firmly as not to be shaken out, and yet loose enough to turn round without difficulty.\n\nThe piece being thus fixed, it is necessary in the next place to adjust the cord, by making it pass twice round the piece, and in such a manner that the two ends of the cord, both that which is fixed to the spang and to the foot-board, come off on the side on which the turner stands, that the piece may move against the edge of the cutting-tool and be turned. If the lathe be moved by a wheel, the manner of adjusting the cord needs no directions.\n\nIf the workman does not choose to be at the trouble to find the two centres of the piece in the manner described above, let him lay, as nearly as he can, the centre of one end upon the point of the left hand puppet, and then let him push forward the right hand puppet, striking it with a mallet till its point is as near as he can in the centre of the other end of the piece; and then fixing the right hand puppet by a gentle blow of the mallet on the key, let him turn round the piece to see by the eye if the centres have been properly found. If any part of it bellies out, let him strike that part gently with the mallet till it goes properly; then let him strike one of the puppets pretty smartly to drive the points into the piece, and afterwards fix the puppet by striking the key. If the workman cannot judge by the eye whether the piece be turning properly round its centres or not, he should apply gently the point of an instrument called a triangular graver, leaning it on the ref, and it will mark by a line the place where the piece is out of its centre; and by striking upon this line with a mallet, the piece can easily be placed properly. The ref, of which we have just spoken, ought to be placed upon the two arms of the lathe, and fixed with screws as near the piece as the workman pleases.\n\nThe piece being fixed between the two points of the puppets (or, as they are called in Scotland, the heads), the cord adjusted, and the ref fixed as near the work as possible without touching it; the workman is now to take a gouge (fig. 2, in which a is the mouth and b the handle) of a proper size in his left hand, and hold it by the handle a little inclined, keeping the back of the hand...\nhand lowermost. With his right hand, the back of which is to be turned upwards, he is to grasp it as near the end as possible on this side of the reft; then leaning the gouge on the reft, he is to present the edge of it a little higher than the horizontal diameter of the piece, so as to form a kind of tangent to its circumference; then putting the right foot on the foot-board, and turning round the wheel, and holding the gouge firmly on the reft, the piece will be cut neatly. In the same manner are the chisels, formers, and other instruments to be used, taking care that the wood be cut equally, and that the instrument be not pushed improperly, sometimes stronger than at others; and taking care also that the instrument used do not follow the work, but that it be kept firmly in the hand without yielding.\n\nThe young turner ought to endeavour to acquire the management of the gouge and the chisel, which are the instruments by far the most frequently used, and the most necessary in this art: by them, almost entirely, are the soft woods turned; for as for hard woods and other things, as box, ebony, horn, ivory, and the metals, they are hardly ever turned except by shaving off. In that case gravers are to be used with square, round, or triangular mouths (fig. 3, 4, 5). They should be held horizontally while applied to the wood, and not obliquely as directed for the gouge and the chisel.\n\nAfter the work is completely turned, it is next to be polished; and this cannot be done with the instruments hitherto mentioned. Soft woods, as pear-tree, hazel, maple, ought to be polished with shark-skin or Dutch rushes. There are different species of sharks; some of which have a grayish, others a reddish skin. Shark-skin is always the better to be a good deal used; at first it is too rough for polishing. The Dutch-rush (equisetum hyemale), which grows in moist places among mountains, and is a native of Scotland. The oldest plants are the best. Before using them they should be moistened a little, otherwise they break in pieces almost immediately, and render it exceedingly difficult to polish with them. They are particularly proper for smoothing the hard woods, as box, lignum vitae, ebony, &c. After having cleaned up the piece well, it should be rubbed gently either with wax or olive-oil, then wiped clean and rubbed with its own rappings or with a cloth a little worn. Ivory, horn, silver, and brads, are polished with pumice-stone finely pounded and put upon leather or a linen cloth a little moistened: with this the piece is rubbed as it turns round in the lathe; and to prevent any dirt from adhering to any part of it, every now and then it is rubbed gently with a small brush dipped in water. To polish very finely, the workmen make use of tripoli, a particular kind of earth, and afterwards of putty or calx of tin. Iron and steel are polished with very fine powder of emery; this is mixed with oil, and put between two pieces of very tender wood, and then the iron is rubbed with it. Tin and silver are polished with a burnisher and that kind of red stone called in France sanguiine dune. They may be polished also with putty, putting it dry into thamoy-skim, or with the palm of the hand.\n\nTo succeed in turning iron, it is necessary to have a lathe exceedingly strong in all its parts, and exceedingly well fixed. The puppets should be short, and the reft well fixed very near the work; the back of the reft should be two or three lines lower than the iron to be turned.\n\nThe lathe and other instruments being prepared, it is necessary to determine the length and thickness of the iron to be turned according to the design which is to be executed, and to make a model of it in wood a little thicker than it ought to be: Then one exactly like this is to be forged of the best iron that can be procured; that is to say, it must not be new, but well prepared and well beaten with hammers; it must have no flaws, nor cracks, nor pimples. New iron, which has not been well beaten, often contains round drops of cast iron, called by the workmen grains, which blunt the edges of the gouges, chisels, and other instruments used for cutting, break them, or make them slide. The iron being forged according to the model, it should be annealed, that is, heated red hot and allowed to cool slowly on the coals till the fire go out of itself. Some people, to soften the iron, cover it over with clay and allow it to cool. The iron cylinder being thus made, it is next to be put upon the lathe, finding the centres as formerly directed, and boring a small hole in them that the iron may not escape from the points.\n\nThe points should be oiled from time to time to prevent their being excessively heated and spoiled while the iron is turning. A crochet is then to be applied to the iron to be turned, a little above its centre, pretty gently, and by this means the inequalities of the cylinder will be taken off. Other instruments are then to be applied to mold the iron according to the model; and whenever any of them grow hot, they are to be plunged into a basin of water lying beside the workman. If the iron, after being properly turned, is to be bored like a gun-barrel, one of the puppets is to be removed and another substituted in its place, having a square hole through it, into which the collar of the iron is to be fixed firmly, so as not to shake; then borers are to be applied, like those which locksmiths use to bore keys; and beginning with a small one, and afterwards taking larger ones, the hole is to be made as wide and deep as necessary; great care must be taken to hold the borers firm on the reft, otherwise there is danger of not boring the hole straight. The borer must be withdrawn from time to time to oil it and to clean the hole. Since it is difficult to make a hole quite round with borers alone, it is necessary to have also an instrument a good deal smaller than the hole, one of the sides of which is sharp, very well tempered, and a little hollow in the middle. This instrument being fixed in a pretty long handle, is to be applied with steadiness to the inner surface of the hole, and it will entirely remove every inequality that may have been there before its application.\n\nTo cut a screw upon the cylinder, some persons use an instrument consisting principally of a female screw; but this is rather an improper instrument; for if one presses too violently, or inclines it ever so little to the right or left, he runs the greatest risk of spoiling the screw. To avoid this danger, some use it only to trace out the lines of the screw, and afterwards finish it with a file. But the following is a much better way. Take a tap for making a female screw, the threads of which have been cut very accurately, and exactly of the size of the screw which you want; and having put it in the opening which you have traced in the collar of the axis","sp":123,"ep":130},{"h":"TURNING","t":"Plate DXL.\n\nFig. 1.\n\nFig. 2. Fig. 3. Fig. 4. Fig. 5.\n\nVARIATION of the Compafs.\n\nFig. 1.\n\nFig. 3.\n\nFig. 2.\n\nW. Trewin Sculpt\nTurning axis on which the screw is to be cut, folder it with tin, sal-ammoniac, and rosin, as exactly corresponding to the axis as possible. Take then a puppet with a hole cut into a corresponding female screw, into which the male screw is to be put. The axis on which the screw is to be cut must be placed exactly horizontally between the two puppets. The reft is then to be brought as near as possible to the place where the screw is to be cut, and a small hollow should be cut in that part of it which is exactly opposite to the place where the screw is to be cut, to hold your instrument firmly and prevent it from shaking. The instrument with which the screw is to be cut should be very sharp, and its point should make an angle of 60\u00b0 with the screw to be cut; and if you wish the screw to be cut very deep, it should make an angle a little larger. The lathe being now put in motion, the tap fixed at the end of the axis will move gradually through the female screw in the puppet; and your instrument in the mean time will trace a similar male screw on the axis fixed in the lathe. Many persons, after having in this manner drawn the outlines of the screw, finish it with a screw-tale of three teeth corresponding exactly to the size of the screw, or with a triangular file; but this last method is rather improper.\n\nFor turning ovals, a lathe of somewhat different construction is used. The axis or spindle, having on it the pulley over which the band-cord passes for turning the lathe, is fixed between the two puppets so as to turn round easily: one end of it passes through one of the puppets, and to it is firmly fixed a circular plate of brass, so that it turns round along with the spindle. Upon this plate two brazen segments of circles are fastened, the circumferences of which correspond to the circumference of the plate: their chords are parallel, and equally distant from the centre of the plate, so that they leave a distance between them. They have a groove in each of them: in these grooves another plate is placed which exactly fills up the space between the two grooves, but is shorter than the diameter of the larger circular plate on which it is laid. This plate is made to slide in the grooves. To its centre is fixed a short spindle, on which the piece of wood to be turned is fixed. When the lathe is set a going, the circular plate moves round, and carries the piece along with it; the plate of brass on which the piece is fixed being fixed loosely in the grooves already described, slides down a little every time that the grooves become perpendicular to the floor (and there are particular contrivances to prevent it from sliding down too far); and by these two motions combined, the circular one of the large plate, and the straight one of the small, the circumference of the piece of wood to be turned necessarily describes an oval; and gouges or other tools being applied in the usual manner supported on the reft, it is cut into an oval accordingly. The small plate may be made to slide either more or less in the grooves; and by this contrivance the transverse diameter of the oval, or rather ellipse, may be made longer or shorter at pleasure.\n\n1. The method of moulding boxes of shell and horn.\u2014In the first place, form a proper mould, which must consist of two pieces, viz. of a circle about half an inch thick, which should slope a little in order to draw out the moulded shell the more easily; and a ring fitted to the outside of the circle, so that both together make the shape of a box. These two pieces being adjusted, it is necessary to round the shell to be moulded of such a size that, when moulded, it will be a little higher than the ring of the mould, that there may be no deficiency. The mould is then to be put into a press on a plate of iron, exactly under the screw of the press; put there the shell upon the circle of the mould, so that its centre also is exactly opposite to the screw of the press; then take a piece of wood formed into a truncated cone, and not so thick as the diameter of the circle of the mould, nor so deep as the ring: then put a plate of iron above the cone, and screw down the press gently and cautiously till the whole is well fixed: then plunge the whole into a cauldron of boiling water placed above a fire. In 8 or 10 minutes the shell or horn will begin to soften; screw the press a little firmer that the wooden cone may sink into the softened shell: repeat this from time to time till the cone is quite sunk in the mould; then take out the press and plunge it into cold water. When it is cold, take the box now formed out of the mould, and put into the inside of it a new mould of tin exactly of the form you wish the inside of the box to be; do the same with the outside, put it again into the press and plunge it into boiling water; screw the press gradually till the box receive the desired form.\n\n2. Method of preparing green wood so that it will not split in the turning.\u2014Cut the wood into pieces of a proper size, put them into a vessel full of potash ley. Boil them about an hour; take the cauldron from the fire, allow the ley to cool; and take out the wood and dry it in the shade.\n\n3. Method of giving an ebony-black to hard and fine woods.\u2014After forming the wood into the defined figure, rub it with aquafortis a little diluted. Small threads of wood will rise in the drying, which you will rub off with pumice-stone. Repeat this process again, and then rub the wood with the following composition: Put into a glazed earthen vessel a pint of strong vinegar, two ounces of fine iron-filings, and half a pound of pounded galls, and allow them to infuse for three or four hours on hot cinders. At the end of this time augment the fire, and pour into the vessel four ounces of copperas, and a choping of water having half an ounce of borax and as much indigo dissolved in it; and make the whole boil till a froth rises. Rub several layers of this upon the wood; and when it is dry, polish it with leather, on which you have put a little tripoli.\n\n4. Method of giving to plum-tree the colour of brazil wood.\u2014Slake lime with urine, and bedaub the wood over with it while it is hot: allow it to dry; then take off the coat of lime and rub it with shamoy skin well oiled. Or, steep the wood in water, having a quantity of alum dissolved in it: then, having allowed brazil wood to dissolve in water five or six hours, steep the wood in it, kept lukewarm during a night; and when it is dry, rub it, as before directed, with shamoy skin well oiled.\n\n5. Method of giving a fine black colour to wood\u2014Steep the wood for two or three days in lukewarm water in which a little alum has been dissolved; then put a handful of logwood, cut small, into a pint of water, and boil it down to less than half a pint. If you then add a little indigo, the colour will be more beautiful. Spread a layer of this liquor quite hot on the wood with a pencil, which will give it a violet colour.\nWhen it is dry, spread on another layer; dry it again and give it a third: then boil verdigris at discretion in its own vinegar, and spread a layer of it on the wood; when it is dry, rub it with a brush, and then with oiled flannel skin. This gives a fine black, and imitates perfectly the colour of ebony.\n\n6. Method of cleaning and whitening bones before using them.\u2014Having taken off with a saw the useless ends of the bones, make a strong ley of ashes and quicklime, and into a pailful of this ley put four ounces of alum, and boil the bones in it for an hour; then take the vessel containing the ley off the fire, and let it cool; then take out the bones and dry them in the shade.\n\n7. Method of soldering shells.\u2014Clean the two sides of the shells which you wish to join together; then, having joined them, wrap them up in linen folded double and well moistened; then heat two plates of iron pretty hot that they may keep their heat for some time; and putting the shells rolled up between them under a press, which you must screw very tight, leave them there till the whole is cold, and they will be soldered. If you do not succeed the first time, repeat the process.\n\n8. Method of moulding shells.\u2014Put six pints of water into a kettle; add to it an ounce of olive or other oil; make the water boil; then put in your shell, and it will grow soft. Take it out and put it into a mould under a press, and it will take the figure you want. This must be done quickly; for if the shell cool ever so little, the process will fail. It will not require much pressure.\n\n9. Method of tinging bones and ivory red.\u2014Boil shavings of scarlet in water. When it begins to boil, throw in a quarter of a pound of ashes made from the dregs of wine, which will extract the colour: then throw in a little rock alum to clear it, and pass the water through a linen cloth. Steep the ivory or bone in aquafortis, and put it into the water. If you wish to leave white spots, cover the places destined for them with wax.\n\n10. To tinge ivory black.\u2014Steep the ivory during five or six days in water of galls with ashes made with dried dregs of wine and arsenic; then give it two or three layers of the same black with which plum-tree is blackened, in order to imitate ebony. Or, dissolve silver in aquafortis, and put into it a little rofe-water. Rub the ivory with this, and allow it to dry in the sun.\n\n11. Method of hardening wood to make pulleys.\u2014After finishing the pulley, boil it seven or eight minutes in olive oil, and it will become as hard as copper.\n\n12. To make Chinese varnish.\u2014Take of gum lac in grains four ounces; put it into a strong bottle with a pound of good spirit of wine, and add about the bulk of a hazel nut of camphor. Allow them to mix in summer in the sun, or in winter on hot embers for 24 hours, shaking the bottle from time to time. Pass the whole through a fine cloth, and throw away what remains upon it. Then let it settle for 24 hours, and you will find a clear part in the upper part of the bottle, which you must separate gently, and put into another vial, and the remains will serve for the first layers.\n\nTURNSTONE.

The Ostrogoths possessed themselves of it in the fifth century, and after them the Lombards, who were expelled by Charlemagne anno 800; in consequence of which it became subject to the German emperors, who appointed governors over it. At last the cities of Florence, Pisa, Sienna, and some others, during the contentions between the pope and the emperor, and their respective adherents, the Guelphs and Gibbelines, withdrew themselves from the dominion of both, and erected themselves into separate commonwealths. In that of Florence, John de Medici, a popular nobleman, so inflamed himself into the favour of his countrymen, that they invested him with sovereign power. Pope Pius V. conferred the title of grand duke on Cosmo de Medici anno 1570, in whose family the duchy continued until the death of Gaston de Medici, who died anno 1737. The duchy was then transferred to the duke of Lorrain, afterwards the em-\nperor Francis I. in lieu of the duchy of Lorrain, which, by the peace of 1736, was given to King Stanislaus during his life, and then was to be annexed to France. Leopold, the second son of Francis I., and afterwards emperor of Germany, succeeded to this duchy. It is now enjoyed by Leopold's second son, brother to the present emperor of Germany, Francis II. The grand duke's annual revenues are computed at about 500,000l. sterling, arising chiefly from the tenths of all estates that are sold or alienated, and the ground-rents of the houses in Leghorn, and the duties on almost all manner of provisions.

He was of Magdalene-hall in Oxford, where he distinguished himself by imbibing early the doctrines of Luther, and by zealously propagating them. Afterwards he removed to Cambridge, and from thence went to live with a gentleman in Gloucestershire in the capacity of tutor to his children.\u2014While he continued there, he showed himself so furious for Luther, and so inveterate to the pope, that he was forced, merely for the security of his person, to leave the place. He next endeavoured to get into the service of Tonfall bishop of Durham, but did not succeed. His zeal for Lutheranism made him desirous to translate the New Testament into English; and as this could not safely be done in England, he went into Germany, where, setting about the work, he finished it in 1527. He then began with the Old Testament, and finished the five books of Moses, prefixing discourses to each book, as he had done to those of the New Testament. At his first going over into Germany, he went into Saxony, and had much conference with Luther; and then returning to the Netherlands, made his abode chiefly at Antwerp. During his peregrinations from one country to another, he suffered shipwreck upon the coast of Holland, and lost all his books and papers. His translations of the Scriptures being in the mean time sent to England, made a great noise there; and, in the opinion of the clergy, did so much mischief, that a royal proclamation was issued, prohibiting the buying or reading them. But the clergy were not satisfied with this, they knew Tyndale capable of doing infinite harm, and therefore thought of nothing less than removing him out of the way. For this purpose one Philips was sent over to Antwerp, who insinuated himself into his company, and under the pretext of friendship betrayed him into custody. He was sent to the castle of Filford, about 18 miles from Antwerp; and though the English merchants at Antwerp did what they could to procure his release, and letters were also sent from Lord Cromwell and others out of England, yet Philips betirred himself so heartily, that he was tried and condemned to die. He was first strangled by the hands of the common hangman, and then burned near Filford castle, in 1536. While he was tying to the stake, he cried with a fervent and loud voice, \"Lord, open the king of England's eyes.\"\n\nTYPE (\u03c4\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2), an impression, image, or representation of some model, which is termed the antitype.

There were two cities of that name; the one\ncalled Palestynus, situated on the continent; and the\nother the city of Tyre, built on an island about half a\nmile from the shore. It was about 19 miles in circum-\nference, including Palestynus; the town on the island\nwas about four miles round. The buildings of Tyre\nwere very magnificent; the walls were 150 feet high,\nand broad in proportion. This city was at one period\nthe most famous commercial city in the world. Of its\ncommercial transactions, the most particular account\nthat is to be found in any ancient writer has been given\nby the prophet Ezekiel, which at the same time con-\nveys a magnificent idea of the extensive power of that\nstate. It resisted Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon for\n13 years; at the end of which, wearied with fruitless\nefforts, the inhabitants resolved to place the sea be-\ntween them and their enemy, and passed accordingly in-\nto the island. The new city stood out against Alexan-\nder the Great for seven months; and before he could take it, he was obliged to fill up the strait which sepa-\nrated the island from the continent. It was repaired af-\nterwards by Adrian, and became the metropolis of the\nprovince.

The emperors of Germany took the practice from those of the eastern empire: King Pepin of France was the first who received the unction. In the ancient Christian church, unction always accompanied the ceremonies of baptism and confirmation. Extreme unction, or the anointing persons in the article of death, was also practised by the ancient Christians, in compliance with the precept of St James, chap v. 14th and 15th verses; and this extreme unction the Roman church has advanced to the dignity of a sacrament. It is administered to none but such as are affected with some mortal disease, or in a decrepit age. It is refused to impotent persons, as also to criminals. The parts to be anointed are the eyes, the ears, the nostrils, the mouth, the hands, the feet, and the reins. The laity are anointed in the palms of the hands, but priests on the back of it; because the palms of their hands have been already consecrated by ordination.\n\nThe oil with which the sick person is anointed represents the grace of God, which is poured down into the soul, and the prayer used at the time of anointing expresses the remission of sins thereby granted to the sick person; for the prayer is this: \"By this holy unction, and his own most pious mercy, may the Almighty God forgive thee whatever sins thou hast committed by the sight,\" when the eyes are anointed; \"by the hearing,\" when the ears are anointed; and so of the other senses.","sp":195,"ep":195},{"h":"UNDECAGON","t":"is a regular polygon of 11 sides.","sp":195,"ep":195},{"h":"UNDECEMVIR","t":"a magistrate among the ancients from the Athenians, who had 10 other colleagues or associates.\njoined with him in the same commission.

This union, in vain attempted by King James I. was at length effected in the year 1707, 6 Anne, when 25 articles were agreed to by the parliament of both nations; the purport of the most considerable Union being as follows:\n\n1. That on the first of May 1707, and for ever after, the kingdoms of England and Scotland shall be united into one kingdom, by the name of Great Britain.\n\n2. The succession to the monarchy of Great Britain shall be the same as was before settled with regard to that of England.\n\n3. The united kingdom shall be represented by one parliament.\n\n4. There shall be a communication of all rights and privileges between the subjects of both kingdoms, except where it is otherwise agreed.\n\n5. When England raises 2,000,000l. by a land-tax, Scotland shall raise 48,000l.\n\n6. The standards of the coin, of weights, and of measures, shall be reduced to those of England throughout the united kingdoms.\n\n7. The laws relating to trade, customs, and the excise, shall be the same in Scotland as in England. But all the other laws of Scotland shall remain in force; but alterable by the parliament of Great Britain. Yet with this caution, that laws relating to public policy are alterable at the discretion of the parliament; laws relating to private right are not to be altered but for the evident utility of the people of Scotland.\n\n8. Sixteen peers are to be chosen to represent the peerage of Scotland in parliament, and 45 members to fit in the house of commons.\n\n9. The 16 peers of Scotland shall have all privileges of parliament; and all peers of Scotland shall be peers of Great Britain, and rank next after those of the same degree at the time of the union, and shall have all privileges of peers, except sitting in the house of lords, and voting on the trial of a peer.\n\nThese are the principal of the 25 articles of union, which are ratified and confirmed by statute 5 Anne, c. 8., in which statute there are also two acts of parliament recited; the one of Scotland, whereby the church of Scotland, and also the four universities of that kingdom, are established for ever, and all succeeding sovereigns are to take an oath inviolably to maintain the same; the other of England, 5 Anne, c. 6., whereby the acts of uniformity of 13 Eliz. and 13 Car. II. (except as the same had been altered by parliament at that time), and all other acts then in force for the preservation of the church of England, are declared perpetual; and it is stipulated, that every subsequent king and queen shall take an oath inviolably to maintain the same within England, Ireland, Wales, and the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed. And it is enacted, that these two acts \"shall for ever be observed as fundamental and essential conditions for the union.\"\n\nUpon these articles and act of union, it is to be observed, 1. That the two kingdoms are to inseparably united, that nothing can ever disunite them; except the mutual consent of both, or the successful resistance of either, upon apprehending an infringement of those points which, when they were separate and independent nations, it was mutually stipulated should be \"fundamental and essential conditions of the union.\" 2. That whatever else may be deemed \"fundamental and essential conditions,\" the preservation of the two churches, of England and Scotland, in the same state that they were in at the time of the union, and the maintenance of\nof the acts of uniformity which established the liturgy, are expressly declared so to be. 3. That therefore any alteration in the constitution of either of these churches, or in the liturgy of the church of England (unless with the consent of the respective churches, collectively or representatively given), would be an infringement of those \"fundamental and essential conditions,\" and greatly endanger the union. 4. That the municipal laws of Scotland are ordained to be still observed in that part of the island, unless altered by parliament; and as the parliament has not yet thought proper, except in a few instances, to alter them, they still, with regard to the particulars unaltered, continue in full force.\n\nFor an account of the union of Ireland with Great Britain, thus forming the united kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, see IRELAND, No. 120.","sp":195,"ep":197},{"h":"UNISON","t":"in Music.

They are commonly called Moravians, from their original country, and Herrnhuters, from their chief place of residence. Some account of this society has already been given under HERRNHIUT; but as that account may, by some, not be deemed sufficiently full, we shall here add a summary of their institutes, derived from a communication by one of their own clergy.\n\nThough the church of the United Brethren is episcopal, their bishops possess no elevation of rank or pre-eminence authority, their church being governed by synods or consistories from all the congregations, and by subordinate bodies, called conferences. The synods are generally held once in seven years. In the first sitting a president is chosen; and the elders appointed by the former synod to superintend the unity, lay down their office, though they still form a part of the assembly, as well as the bishops, the lay elders, and those ministers who have the inspection of several congregations in one province.\n\nQuestions of importance, or of which the consequences cannot be foreseen, are decided by lot, though this is never used till after mature deliberation and fervent prayer. In the synods, the state of the unity, and the concerns of the congregations and missions, are taken into consideration.\n\nTowards the conclusion of every synod, a kind of executive board is appointed, called the elders' conference of the unity, consisting of 13 elders, and divided into four committees or departments, one for superintending missions into heathen countries; a second for watching over the conduct of congregations; a third for managing the economical concerns of the unity, and a fourth for maintaining the discipline of the society. These conferences, however, are amenable to a higher committee, called the elders' conference, the powers of which are very extensive. It appoints and removes every servant in the unity, authorizes the bishops to ordain presbyters or deacons, and to consecrate other bishops, and in short, possesses the supreme executive power over the whole society.\n\nA bishop of the United Brethren can discharge no office but by the appointment of the synod, or of the elders' conference. Indeed their deacons can perform every office of the bishops, except ordination, and appear to confirm young persons when they first become candidates for the communion. Even female deacons are employed for the purpose of privately admonishing their own sex, and visiting them in cases of sickness. There are also lay elders, whose business it is to watch over the constitution and discipline of the unity; to enforce the observance of the laws of the country in which missions are established, and to guard the privileges conferred on the brethren by the government under which they live.\n\nOn Sunday, besides the public prayers, one or two sermons are preached in every church, and after the morning service, an exhortation is given to the children. Previous to the holy communion, which is administered on some Sunday once a month, and on Maunday Thursday, each person before he communicates, must converse on the state of his soul with one of the elders. Love feasts are frequent, and on Maunday Thursday the society have a solemn footwashing.\n\nOur limits will not permit us to give a systematic view of the doctrinal tenets of the Brethren. Though they acknowledge no other standard of truth than the sacred scriptures, they adhere to the Augsburg confession, and speak respectfully of the 39 articles of the church of England. They profess to believe that the kingdom of Christ is not confined to any particular party, community, or church; and they consider themselves as spiritually joined in the bond of Christian love to all who are taught of God, and belong to the universal church of Christ, however much they may differ in forms, which they deem non-essentials.

The principal islands are Walcheren, Joodland, South and North Beveland, and Wolfersdyk, composing West Zealand; Schouwen, Duiveland, Fertholm, and St Philipsland, forming East Zealand; Goeree in South Holland, the Texel, Vlieland, and Ameland, to the west and north of Frieland.\n\nThe Dutch had formerly considerable colonial territory; but this is now reduced to part of Java, Sumatra, and the Molucca islands, with some other settlements in the East Indies; some trading factories on the Guinea coast; St Eustatius and part of Surinam in South America.\n\nThe face of the country is, in general, extremely uniform, consisting of large tracts of marshy pastures, or sandy heaths, interspersed with several large rivers, and numerous canals. There are a few hills in the eastern districts, but the coasts are so low, that, but for the dykes or sea walls, they would be inundated by the sea. The soil consists almost entirely of alluvial earth and vegetable mold, and is very productive. The climate is moist, inclement, and peculiarly inhospitable to strangers; intermittent fevers and similar diseases, the attendants on a marshy and watery soil, being extremely frequent. The winters are colder and the summers hotter than in Britain.\n\nThe principal rivers of the United Provinces are the Rhine, the Maese or Meuse, and the Escaut or Scheldt, which separates them from French Flanders. There are few lakes of any note, except the sea of Haerlem, near the Zuider Zee.\n\nThere is little interesting in the natural history of Holland; the animals and plants resembling those of the adjacent countries of France and Germany, and its mineral products being extremely few. Its chief artificial products are flax, tobacco, madder and flower roots, butter and cheese. The state of agriculture is but little advanced; as almost the whole country is under grass, and the corn produced is not nearly sufficient for home consumption.\n\nThe changes which the coasts of the Dutch provinces have undergone, in consequence of the shifting of the geography, beds of rivers, the encroachments or retiring of the sea, and tempests from the German ocean, render their progressive geography an interesting object. We find that in the latter periods of the Roman empire, the river Rhine divided itself into two great branches at Burginafium, the modern Schenk, about five miles north-west of Colonia Trajana, near the present Cleves. The southern branch joined the Meuse at the town of Mola or Muvi, while the northern branch passed by Durstadt, Utrecht, and Leyden, to the ocean. The northern branch of the Rhine was joined to the Yssel by the canal of Druus (see Batavorum Infula), while this latter river flowed into a considerable lake called Flevo, now a southern portion of the Zuider Zee. When the canal of Druus was\n\n(a) See each of these articles in the general alphabet.\nwas neglected, the waters of the Rhine poured into the Yssel with such violence as to increase the lake of Flevo to a great expanse of waters, so that instead of a river which once ran from that lake to the sea for nearly 50 Roman miles, there was opened the wide gulf which now forms the entrance. In the mean time, the northern branch of the Rhine became much diminished, and the canal of Druius gradually disappeared. The estuaries of the Meuse and the Scheldt being open to great inroads from the sea, have also materially changed their figure and position; and the latter in particular, which once formed merely a triangular island, divided into four or five smaller branches, which are now extensive creeks, dividing the islands of Zeeland and South Holland. In the beginning of the 15th century, the estuary of the Meuse suddenly formed a vast lake to the south-east of Dort, overwhelming 72 villages, and 100,000 inhabitants. By a subsequent change, the Rhine was again subdivided, the northern branch falling into the Leck, while the southern formed the modern Waal.\n\nThe early history of these provinces, from their subjection by the Romans, till they fell under the dominion of the Spanish monarchy, has been already given under the article NETHERLANDS, so that we have here to relate only those transactions which have taken place since the accession of Philip II. to the crown of Spain (b).\n\nAt the death of Charles V. the Dutch provinces were in a very flourishing condition. In this small tract were then reckoned not fewer than 350 large walled cities, and 6300 considerable towns or large villages, all become rich by their application to arts and commerce. The same application had diffused a spirit of independence among the inhabitants, who were jealously alive to every invasion of their rights and privileges. The reformed religion had made considerable progress among all ranks, and the doctrines of Calvin had been embraced by a great majority of the people. Hence, nothing could be more impolitic than the measures taken by Philip to advance the cause of popery, and to enforce obedience to the tyrannical acts of his deputies. The establishment of a court of inquisition, the increase of the number of bishoprics, the appointment of Cardinal Grandv\u00e8de to be chief counsellor to the duchess of Parma, the regent of the Netherlands, and the enormous taxes levied to support the Spanish forces, were no trifling grievances, and created such a spirit of disaffection, that when the duchess assumed the reins of government, in the year 1560, the murmurs of the people could no longer be suppressed.\n\nA deputation of the malcontents, at the head of whom were William prince of Orange, and his brother Louis of Nassau, with the counts of Egmont and Horn, waited on the duchess at Brussels, and insisted either on the dismissal of Cardinal Grandv\u00e8de, or the calling of an assembly of the states-general. The duchess thought proper to comply with the former of these requests, but as that minister was succeeded by two of his creatures, who trod exactly in his footsteps, and in particular increased the religious persecutions, and the power of the inquisition, the popular ferment became greater than ever. The patriots sent Count Egmont to Madrid, to lay their grievances before the king; but that monarch with his accustomed insincerity, returned a favourable answer to their remonstrances, without changing any of the obnoxious measures of the government at Brussels. In the meantime the diabolical combination that had been formed between Charles IX. of France and Isabella of Spain, for the massacre of the protestants, which soon after took place, had been whispered in the Low Countries, and in consequence a general association was formed for the purpose of abolishing the court of inquisition. This association, headed by Henry de Brodenrode, a descendant of the earls of Holland, waited on the regent in such a formidable body, that she was obliged to promise the exertion of her utmost influence towards obtaining their demands. It is said, however, that she could obtain no better terms from the bigotted Philip than that heretics should in future be hanged instead of burnt.\n\nAs the people found that their dutiful remonstrances could obtain no redress, they determined to take into their own hands the necessary reformation. In several towns in Flanders, the people assembled, destroyed churches, pulled down images, and committed other acts of violence. The principal inhabitants, however, while they were preparing to resist the oppressive acts of the government, behaved with more temperance and moderation; a new oath of allegiance had been exacted, and this the counts of Egmont and Horn, probably with a view to temporise, were induced to take, but the prince of Orange steadily refused, and retired into Germany, whither he was followed by great numbers of all ranks and conditions, so that within a few days 100,000 families had left the Low Countries. This emigration so much alarmed the duchess of Parma, that she resigned the regency.\n\nThe duchess was succeeded by the duke of Alva, Duke of Alva who had been sent into the Netherlands with an army of 10,000 veteran troops, to intimidate the people, and enforce obedience to the civil power. We have already drawn the character of this bloody man (see Alva), and have shown how well he was calculated to execute the orders of a tyrannical and bigotted master. He no sooner entered on his government than the whole country was filled with terror; Counts Egmont and Horn were ignominiously executed, and the estates of the prince of Orange were confiscated.\n\nThis prince and his brother had been labouring to support the cause of their injured countrymen among the German patriots.\n\n(b) There is no part of the history of nations more interesting in itself, or more replete with useful lessons to rulers and subjects, than that which records the struggles of a brave people to preserve or regain their liberties and independence. Hence the glorious contest which the Dutch provinces maintained against the power of Spain, and by which they finally triumphed over tyranny and oppression, might well deserve a much fuller detail than our confined limits will enable us to afford. In the compendious view which we have here given of these transactions, we have endeavoured to catch the more prominent features, and thus in some measure preserve the spirit of the picture. We may refer our readers for a minute account of these events to The Modern Universal History, vol. xxxi., and Watson's History of the Reigns of Philip II. and Philip III.\nGerman princes, and had raised a detachment of Germans, by which they were enabled to make head against the regent. The prince of Orange, who had been always a favourite with the people, was now rendered more popular in consequence of his sufferings in their cause, and was invited to take the command of the armed bodies which were preparing to resist the duke of Alva.\n\nThe prince first penetrated into Brabant, and attempted to surprise Ruremond, but was defeated by a detachment of the Spanish army; but his brother soon after overpowered a body of Spaniards, and killed 600. In a subsequent engagement, however, with the main body of Alva's army, Prince Louis was entirely defeated, and all his infantry cut in pieces. The prince of Orange finding that he could not at present keep the field against so formidable an enemy, and that his soldiers deserted in consequence of his ill success and want of pay, was, in 1569, obliged to disband his army, and return to Germany.\n\nThe duke of Alva did not fail to make the most of his success. All the prisoners taken in the last campaign were put to death, and the tenth part of every man's estate, with a tenth of all merchandise, were exacted as an annual payment from the inhabitants, under the penalty of military execution. The states offered to pay an annual subsidy of 2,000,000 florins, in place of these taxes; but these offers were rejected with disdain.\n\nThe people thus driven to despair, were resolved to strain every nerve to resist these oppressing acts. The tradesmen in the towns shut their shops, and the peasants refused to bring provisions to the markets. In the meantime a squadron of ships, which is known by the name of gueux, had been fitted out by the prince of Orange, and the command given to Lumey. The willing success of this squadron, which had captured Brielle, in the island of Voon, and repulsed a force sent against it by the duke of Alva, induced the Zeelanders to collect all their ships, and also oppose the enemy at sea. A considerable advantage was gained by this fleet, against a Spanish squadron commanded by the duke of Medina Celi. The duke was entirely defeated, many of his ships were taken, and the Zeelanders carried off a booty of nearly 1,000,000 of livres.\n\nTo increase his army, the governor had draughted men from the garrisons of most of the fortified towns, and thus exposed them to the attacks of the patriots. Accordingly, Lewis of Nassau surprized Mons, the count de Bergues gained possession of several towns in Overijssel, Guelderland, and Friesland; while another party of the malcontents made themselves masters of North Holland. The duke of Alva now began to feel that he had gone too far, and attempted when too late, to conciliate the good opinion of the people. He published an edict consenting to remit the most oppressive taxes, if the state could suggest any other method of raising the necessary supplies, and he convoked the states-general of the Provinces to assemble at the Hague. His promises and his threats were, however, now disregarded; and the states who, in contempt of his authority had assembled at Dordrecht, openly espoused the cause of their country, declared the prince of Orange commander of the national forces, and raised a considerable sum for the payment of his troops.\n\nThe prince's forces now amounted to 15,000 foot and 7000 horse, with which he advanced into Brabant, and took Ruremond by assault. He then possessed himself of Mechlin, Oudenarde, and Dendermond, and having levied contributions on those inhabitants who adhered to the government, he marched towards Mons, then besieged by the duke of Alva, with an intention to raise the siege, by bringing the duke to a general action. This, however, Alva declined, and Mons was obliged to capitulate.\n\nIn the midst of these successes, a damp was thrown over the ardour of the patriots, by the news of the horrid massacre of St Bartholomew *, and in the same degree the spirits of the Spaniards revived. The prince of France, Orange found himself obliged to retire to the province of Holland, leaving the cities which he had taken at the mercy of the army. Mechlin opened its gates, and was pillaged without mercy, while the other towns were evacuated by the garrisons, and loaded with heavy impositions. In a short time nothing remained to the patriots, but the provinces of Holland and Zealand; but these stood firm in the cause of liberty, and soon became the seat of a fanguinary warfare. Frederic de Toledo was detached by the duke of Alva to reduce the insurgents in these quarters. He quickly reduced Waarden, where his soldiers committed the most horrid acts of barbarity. The capture of this place was followed by that of Haarlem after an obstinate resistance.\n\nTo balance this ill success by land, however, the Zealander obtained many important advantages by sea. They attacked the harbour of Antwerp, and carried off several ships; and when the governor equipped a squadron to oppose them, it was thrice encountered by Wertz, the Zealander admiral, and totally defeated. In the meantime the Spanish forces, under Frederic of Toledo, consisting of 16,000 veterans, sat down before Alkmaer, the fence capital of Holland, a town without regular fortifications, and defended only by 300 burghers and 800 soldiers, in great want of provisions, and without any prospect of speedy relief; yet this place, though attacked with great vigour, by a battery of 20 pieces of heavy cannon, which effected a breach in one of the walls, held out against every attempt, and the Spanish soldiers who attempted to storm the place by the breach, were repulsed with great slaughter, and Frederic was at length compelled to raise the siege.\n\nNotwithstanding these partial successes, the affairs of the patriots were still in a precarious situation. Don Louis de Requenes, who had succeeded the duke of Alva in the government, was directed to carry on the war with the utmost vigour. The prince of Orange had, after a long siege, made himself master of Middleburgh, but had sustained a great loss by the defeat and death of his brother Louis. The patriotic cause derived some advantage, however, from a mutiny which took place in the Spanish army, but this advantage was of a transient nature.\n\nIn the commencement of the year 1575, an attempt at negotiation took place between the contending parties, but they could come to no terms of accommodation, and the war was continued with great virulence. Though much distressed in his finances, Philip made extraordinary efforts to crush the patriots, and succeeded so far, that they almost despaired of ultimate success. In this dilemma they sent a deputation to Queen Elizabeth of England, offering to become her subjects, if she would\nwould afford them her protection; but from political reasons she declined the offer. The distresses which Philip now experienced, and the death of his deputy Requesens, did more for the cause of the patriots than all their own exertions.\n\nProfiting by these events, in the latter end of this year they attacked and carried the citadel of Ghent; while the inhabitants of Antwerp, in revenge for having been pillaged by the Spanish garrison that held the citadel, united in the common cause, by what was called the pacification of Ghent.\n\nA second application to Queen Elizabeth met with more success, and she advanced them the sum of 20,000l. sterling, on condition that they would not invite the French into their territories, that they would listen to any reasonable terms of accommodation, and repay the loan in the course of the ensuing year. Agreeably to these conditions, a cessation of hostilities was granted to the States by Don John of Austria, the present governor, and a treaty was entered into with him for disbanding the foreign troops. The weak state of the government required some concessions, and Don John acceded to the pacification of Ghent, by which most of the demands of the patriots were granted. The provinces of Holland and Zealand, however conceiving that by this treaty the other provinces had conceded too much, refused their concurrence, and hostilities soon recommenced.\n\nThe king of Spain dissatisfied with the concessions of Don John, recalled that governor, and appointed the archduke Matthias in his room, while he made additional preparations for a vigorous prosecution of the war. The States-general in their turn made another application to Queen Elizabeth, and obtained from her, not only a promise of 100,000l. sterling, but of a body of forces consisting of 5000 foot, and 1000 horse; in return for which, the States agreed to put into her possession certain fortified towns, and to transport and pay the forces. These supplies, however, Elizabeth afterwards declined funding, though she professed all possible good will towards the provinces and their cause. A change of measures which about this time took place in the States of Guelderland and Groningen, in favour of the protestant interest, contributed not a little to aid the general cause of the patriots, though several of the provinces were still torn by intestine dissensions and jarring interests. At last the prince of Orange, perceiving that little confidence was to be placed in the unanimity of provinces rent by faction, different in religion, and divided by ambition, political maxims, and private interest, formed the scheme of more closely uniting the provinces of which he was governor, and cementing them with those more contiguous, in which the protestant interest prevailed. Such an alliance was subject to fewer difficulties than attended the more general one of uniting all the provinces; it was in fact the only measure that could be proposed with safety, and it was prosecuted with that alacrity and address for which William was deservedly celebrated.\n\nOn the 23rd of January 1579, deputies from the provinces of Holland, Zealand, Utrecht, Friesland, Groningen, Overijssel, and Guelderland, met at Utrecht, and signed the alliance ever since known by the name of the Union of Utrecht, the basis of that commonwealth so renowned by the appellation of the United Provinces. This treaty of alliance was founded on the infracting of the pacification of Ghent solemnly acceded to by Philip, and the late invasion of certain towns in Guelderland. It was not hereby intended to divide the seven provinces from the other ten, or to renounce the pacification of Ghent; its object was to preserve the liberty stipulated in that pacification, by more vigorous operations, and united councils. The chief articles of this union were the following.\n\nThat the seven provinces shall unite themselves in interest as one province, never to be separated or divided by testament, donation, exchange, sale, or agreement; referring to each particular province and city all its privileges, rights, customs, and statutes. In all disputes arising between either of the provinces, the rest shall interpose only as mediators. They shall assist each other with life and fortune against every foreign attempt upon any particular province, whether to establish sovereignty, the Catholic religion, arbitrary measures, or whatever else may appear inconsistent with the liberties of the province, and the intention of the alliance. All frontier towns belonging to the United Provinces shall, if old, be fortified at the expense of the provinces; if new, at the joint expense of the union. That the public imposts and duties shall be farmed for three months to the highest bidder, and employed with the king's taxes in the public service. No province, city, or member of the union, shall contract an alliance with any foreign prince or power, without the concurrence of all the other members. That foreign powers shall be admitted into the alliance, only by consent of all the contracting parties. As to religion, the provinces of Holland and Zealand shall act in that particular as they think advisable; the rest shall adhere to the purport of the edict published by the archduke Matthias, which prescribed, that no man should be oppressed on account of conscience. All the inhabitants, from the age of 18 to 60, shall be trained and disciplined to war. That peace and war shall be declared by the unanimous voice of all the provinces; other matters that concern the internal policy shall be regulated by a majority. That the States shall be held in the usual constitutional manner, and coinage shall be deferred to future determination. Finally, the parties agree, that the interpretation of these articles shall remain in the States-general; but, in case of their failing to decide, in the stadtholder.\n\nSoon after the union of Utrecht, King Philip did all his utmost to disconcert the projects of the prince of Orange, and to reduce the provinces to their obedience. He offered to restore him to all his estates, to indemnify him for all his losses, and give him the first place in his esteem and favour; but William was too wise to rely on the promises of a prince who had already shewn himself perfidious, and too generous to abandon a cause in which he had embarked from no interested motives. He determined to share the fate of the United Provinces, and not to disappoint the hopes which they had conceived of his conduct.\n\nIn the mean time the duke of Parma was doing his utmost to disconcert the projects of the prince of Orange, and to reduce the provinces to their obedience. He besieged and took the town of Marien; invested Maestricht, and carried it after a siege of four months, and reduced the republican general La Noue to such straits, that he was glad to retreat under the cannon of Antwerp. At length the Provinces, by the advice of the prince of Orange, resolved to solicit the alliance.\naffiliation and protection of the duke of Anjou, to whom they had formerly applied in vain, and to offer him the sovereignty of their territories. Accordingly, in 1582, they solemnly renounced their allegiance to Philip, and acknowledged as their sovereign, Francis Hercules de Valois, duke of Alen\u00e7on and Anjou; and in the following year they published an edict, entitled the abdication of Philip king of Spain, for ever excluding that monarch from any right or authority over the Netherlands.\n\nIn the beginning of the year 1582, the duke of Anjou, who had already taken an active part in favour of his new subjects, and had opposed the duke of Parma with some success, arrived in Holland from England; and in the month of February he was solemnly installed at Antwerp as duke of Brabant. It appears, however, that the prince of Orange, though he had been the great promoter of this measure, and even placed the ducal coronet on the head of the new sovereign, still possessed the greatest influence and authority in the United Provinces.\n\nWhen Philip of Spain found that he could not bribe the prince of Orange to his interests, he resolved to use every method to rid himself of so dangerous an opponent. Soon after the signing of the union of Utrecht, Philip had proscribed the prince, and offered a reward of 25,000 crowns to any person that should bring him dead or alive to Madrid. The greatness of the reward, and a bigotted regard for the interests of the Catholic religion, prompted several to attempt murdering the prince of Orange. He narrowly escaped assassination in 1582; but, two years after, he met his unmerited fate at Delft, by the hands of one Guion, or, as he is commonly called, Balthazar Gerrard. About the same time the duke of Anjou died in France; and the provinces of Holland and Zealand appointed Maurice, son of the late prince of Orange, to be their stadtholder and captain-general. For an account of the actions of this great man, see the article MAURICE OF NAPOLEON.\n\nPhilip II. died in 1598, and Philip III. prosecuted the war with the United Provinces with as much rancour as his predecessors, but with much worse success. The great defeat sustained by the archduke Albert in 1600, and many subsequent disasters, induced the court of Madrid at length to listen to terms of accommodation. In 1607 a suspension of hostilities took place, and the year following a treaty on terms favourable to the Provinces was concluded for 12 years.\n\nAt the expiration of the truce, both parties prepared for a renewal of hostilities; but now the Spaniards fought with considerable dilatation: From a strange policy, which they have since frequently practised, in their contests with the powers of Europe, the Dutch contrived to advance their commercial interests at the expense of their enemy. A very lucrative trade took place between the principal Dutch ports and those of Spain, by which the Spaniards were supplied by their enemies even with ammunition and warlike stores. At the same time the Dutch enriched themselves by numerous prizes taken from the Spaniards, and, in particular, gave a severe blow to the resources of the court of Madrid, by capturing the flota from Mexico, a prize valued at 15,000,000 of livres.\n\nThese repeated losses of the Spaniards proved the inability of their continuing the war against a people so determined as the Dutch. Accordingly, in 1648, they agreed to a treaty of peace, by which his Catholic majesty renounced all right and sovereignty over the states-general of the United Provinces; and these provinces were henceforth declared a free and independent republic. It was also agreed between the contending powers, that each should remain in unmolested possession of those places which they severally held at the signing of the treaty.\n\nFrom this time to the year 1670 we meet with nothing very remarkable in the history of the United Provinces. By invariably pursuing the maxims of prudence, industry, and frugality, the republic had attained the highest pitch of grandeur. Amsterdam became the emporium of Europe, and the richest city in the universe. The population of the Provinces, especially of Holland, was much greater than at any former or subsequent period, though it is scarcely credible that, as some authors affirm, Holland alone should then contain 3,000,000 of inhabitants. The states despatched ministers and consuls to China, Siam, and Bengal; to the Great Mogul, the king of Persia, and the khan of Tartary, the grand signior, the czar of Russia, and the princes of Africa. They were considered as an important weight in the scale of Europe; and no treaty was concluded without the concurrence of their ambassadors.\n\nIt is not surprising that the successes of the Dutch, and dispute the prosperous condition in which they now beheld themselves, should have rendered them rather arrogant towards the neighbouring states. Louis XIV. of France had conceived himself affronted by a foolish boast of one of the Dutch ministers, and he was particularly jealous of the advantage which the new republic had acquired over his subjects in the trade to India. The triple alliance formed about this time between England, Sweden, and the United Provinces, was an additional motive with the French king to break off all intercourse with the Dutch, and to curb their growing power. He began by prevailing on Charles II. of England to abandon the triple alliance; a request to which that worthless monarch, alive to nothing but his pleasures and his avarice, readily agreed, on condition of being well paid for his treachery. Louis also persuaded several of the German princes to unite their forces with his against the republic, and of all the Germanic body, only the elector of Brandenburg interested himself for the safety of the states-general. The French king assembled an army of 100,000 men, which he divided into four columns, one commanded by himself in person, with the assistance of Marshal Turenne; another by the prince of Cond\u00e9; a third by General Croqui, and a fourth under the conduct of the duke of Luxemburg. Such an army drawing towards the frontiers could not but terrify the Dutch, now torn with civil and religious factions. The partisans of the Orange family were for abolishing the perpetual edict, and raising William prince of Orange to the dignity enjoyed by his predecessors; but the De Witt faction opposed him violently, though they could not prevent the young prince from being chosen captain-general and high-admiral. Many hoped that William's new dignity would incline his uncle Charles II. to return to the triple alliance; but that hope was frustrated by the conduct of his majesty, who, in conjunction with the Most Christian king, declared\nUnited Provinces declared war against the states-general on the 7th of April. A month after, the elector of Cologne and bishop of Munster followed the example of the two kings. The Dutch put themselves in the best posture of defense that circumstances would admit. Maastricht was strongly garrisoned; the prince of Orange had assembled an army of 25,000 men, with which he advanced to the banks of the Yssel; and the Dutch fleet cruised off the mouth of the Thames, to prevent the junction of the naval forces of England and France, which amounted to 150 ships. All Europe watched the first motions of the two powerful kings, seconded by the best generals of the age.\n\nHolland could be attacked only by the Rhine or the Meuse, and the French generals and ministers differed by which of these inlets the first impression should be made. At length, after much deliberation, it was determined to attack the Dutch on both these sides at the same time, in order the more to disconcert their councils. The campaign began with the siege of Rheninberg, Vefel, Orsoi, and Rurick, four towns well fortified, and deemed the keys of Holland. Nothing could oppose armies so well appointed, led by generals so skilful and so experienced. The four towns were compelled to surrender within a few days of each other; and a severe defeat sustained by a body of Dutch troops, in attempting to defend the passage of the Rhine, by the prince of Cond\u00e9, served still more to dishearten the troops of the flutes-general.\n\nIt is almost incredible with what rapidity, towns and fortresses yielded to the fortune of his majesty's arms. The reduction of Betau, the most fruitful country of the United Provinces, and the surrender of Tolhusfert, obliged the prince of Orange to abandon the Yssel, lest he should be attacked in the rear, and to retire to the very heart of the country, as far as Rhenen in the province of Utrecht. By this means the town of Arnhem, the forts of Knotsemborough, Voorn, St Andr\u00e9, and Shenck, this last the strongest in the Netherlands, with a variety of other forts and towns, surrendered as soon as summoned; and at last Nimeguen, a town strong from the nature of the works and fortifications, and garrisoned by 8000 fighting men, including the inhabitants, was invested. After the citizens had for eight days exhibited signal proofs of courage in defense of their liberties, they were forced to yield to the superior skill of Turenne.\n\nThe only means by which the Dutch could arrest the progress of the enemy was, to open the sluices and inundate the country. The town of Utrecht set the example, which was soon followed by many others, and in a short time Holland, Brabant, and Dutch Flanders, formed one vast lake, the towns rising like islands in the midst of the waters. An embassy was also sent to the king of England, to request that he would prevail on Louis to relax in the severity of his attack. Charles pretended a compliance with this request; but as his interference produced no effect, it is probable that he was not sincere. In the space of three months, Louis conquered the provinces of Guelderland, Overyssel, and Utrecht, took about 50 towns and forts, and made 24,000 prisoners. The latter, however, were soon released for a trifling ransom. The very successees of the conquerors tended to weaken their force, as they were compelled to leave behind them several strong bodies of troops, to garrison the captured towns. This induced the French to listen to proposals for a negociation, which, however, came to nothing.\n\nMarshal Turenne, now appointed generalissimo of the king's army on his majesty's return to Paris, marched to oppose the elector of Brandenburg and the German general Montecuculi, who had joined their forces, and were about to pass the Rhine. For three whole months were the elector and Montecuculi employed in abortive attempts to effect a passage at Mentz, Coblenz, Strasbourg, and other places. This answered the purpose of making a powerful diversion in favor of the Dutch, though they could not accomplish their design of joining the prince of Orange. After repeated disappointments, the imperial army directed its march to Westphalia; and Turenne followed, in order to keep the bishop of Munster steady to his engagements. For half the campaign he, with a body of 16,000 men, baffled every stratagem of the elector and Montecuculi, the latter the most renowned general of the empire, at the head of an army near triple his strength. He obliged them to go into winter quarters, in a country harassed and exhausted; and confirmed the bishop of Munster in the alliance of France, at the very time he was on terms with the emperor. He obliged the elector of Brandenburg, who took the chief command during Montecuculi's illness, to abandon the siege of Warle, took Unna Kamen, Altena, Berkemham, and several other towns and fortresses. By continuing his operations, he forced the elector out of his winter quarters again into the field, chased him from post to post, until he obliged him to quit Westphalia, repass the Weser, and retire with precipitation into the bishopric of Hildesheim. After taking possession of the elector's towns in Westphalia, he pursued him into the bishopric of Hildesheim, and at length, by mere dint of superior genius, forced him to seek shelter in his hereditary dominions. All this was effected after Louvois had appointed the marshal's army quarters in Alsace and Lorraine, amidst the rigours of a severe winter, opposed by a superior enemy, by the artifices of Louvois, and seconded only by his own prudence, and the affection of his troops, which he maintained in defiance of all the difficulties, hardships and dangers, they encountered. It was indeed supposed, that Montecuculi was prevented from giving Turenne battle by the remonstrances of Prince Lobkovitz, the emperor's ambassador, influenced by the gold of Louis. Certain indeed it is, that Montecuculi's illness arose from his chagrin at seeing all his projects frustrated by the unsteady dilatory conduct of the court of Vienna. Louis's negociations disturbed Europe no less than his arms. His tools and creatures swarmed in every court. Leopold could not be prevented from declaring in favor of Holland; but his ministers were bought off from seconding the emperor's intentions. The whole English nation exclaimed against the alliance of their kingdom with France; but Charles stood in need of French gold to supply his extravagance and profligacy. The elector of Bavaria had indeed been compelled by Louis to retire to his capital; but it was by dint of intrigue that he was forced from his alliance with Holland, and constrained to make a peace with France.\n\nWhile the French generals were thus carrying all before them, the combined fleets of France and England were\nwere scarcely less successful against the maritime power of the Dutch. The English squadron under the duke of York, uniting to that of France under D'Estr\u00e9es, thrice engaged the Dutch fleet commanded by De Ruyter; and though neither party could boast of much advantage, the check sustained by the Dutch admiral was of essential service to the cause of the allies.\n\nAt length the tide of fortune began to turn in favour of the United Provinces. The court of Spain, jealous of the growing power of France, embraced the cause of the Dutch; and sent an army of 10,000 men to the assistance of the prince of Orange, while the mercenary king of England was compelled by his parliament to withdraw from his unnatural alliance with the French king; and the late ill success among the allied troops of France and Germany cooled the elector of Cologne and the bishop of Munster, in their friendship towards Louis. Thus that monarch, forsaken by his allies, was compelled to maintain singly a war against the empire, Spain, and the United Provinces. The accession of the prince of Orange to the throne of England, in 1688, gave an additional blow to the French power, by bringing on an intimate connection between England and Holland.\n\nAt length Louis was compelled to negotiate for peace, which was concluded in 1697, by a treaty extremely favourable to the United Provinces.\n\nAfter the copious detail which we have elsewhere given of the military transactions of Europe, since the accession of William III., to the crown of England, in which the Dutch bore a conspicuous part, it will be here sufficient for us to give a very brief summary of the principal events. After the death of William III., the same plan of humbling the French king, was, in conjunction with the states-general, pursued by his successor Queen Anne; and the numerous and important victories of the duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene, led to the famous treaty of Utrecht, in 1713. See BRITAIN, No. 340\u2014371. In 1747, the office of stadtholder was declared hereditary in the princes of Orange. In the war that took place in 1756, between France and England, a French party was formed in Holland, in opposition to the stadtholder, who favoured the alliance with England. Hence arose a jealousy between the two allies, which, during the American war, increased to an open rupture. See BRITAIN, No. 427, and No. 598 et seq. In 1787, some disputes took place between the stadtholder and the states-general, which induced the former to require the affluence of the king of Prussia. That monarch accordingly sent an army of 18,000 Prussians to Amsterdam, under the duke of Brunswick, who, in 1788, brought the whole country into subjection, and reinstated the stadtholder in his authority. See PRUSSIA, No. 73. In 1794 the republican armies of France having overrun the greater part of Flanders, took possession of the Dutch provinces, which they converted into the Batavian republic. The stadtholder found refuge in England, and the allied armies of Germany and Prussia retreated into Germany. See FRANCE, No. 459, et seq. In the summer of 1799, a considerable British force landed in the Texel island, made themselves masters of the Dutch fleet, and, in conjunction with a body of Russians, gained some advantages on the continent. Being opposed, however, by a superior French force, the army was obliged to re-embark, and return to England. See BRITAIN, No. 1069. By the treaty of Amiens, concluded in March 1802, all the colonies taken by the British were restored to Holland, except the island of Ceylon. On the renewal of hostilities in 1803, the Batavian republic was again compelled to take an active part against Britain, and in consequence again lost the Cape of Good Hope, and several other colonies, besides having her trade entirely ruined. Soon after the imperial diadem of France was conferred on Napoleon Bonaparte, the Dutch republic was elevated to the rank of a kingdom, and the emperor's brother, Louis, was appointed the first king of Holland.\n\nWith respect to the present state of this unfortunate country, we know very little that can be relied on. The people are evidently in a state of complete subjection to the French government; and though the late rumours of their avowed annexation to the empire of France may be premature, there can be little doubt of their being eventually confirmed.\n\nAccording to the statistical table given in No. 2, the population of the United Provinces in the year 1796, appears to amount to 1,880,469 individuals; though it is generally estimated at about 2,000,000. Supposing this latter number to be correct, and that the area of the Dutch territory comprehends 10,000 square miles, there will be 200 individuals to each square mile; a proportion exceeding any thing that is to be found in any other part of Europe.\n\nIn the late republic of Holland, previous to the French revolution, the states-general formed the great and powerful council of the nation. That assembly was formed by deputies from the provincial states, and was invested with the supreme legislative power. It could not, however, make peace or war, form new alliances, or levy taxes, without the consent of the provincial states, nor could these determine any point of importance, without the consent of each of the cities that had a voice in their assembly. The stadtholder exercised a considerable part of the executive power, though in later times his power became very limited. The grand pensionary was properly a minister or servant of the province; and though he possessed great influence, being a perpetual member of the states-general, and of the secret committee, he was considered as inferior in rank to all the deputies.\n\nThe leading features in the constitution of the kingdom of Holland are, the guarantee of the payment of the public debt; the free and unqualified exercise of religion; the predominant authority vested in the king; the establishment of the Salique law, excluding females from the throne; the declaration that the minority of any future king shall expire on his attaining his 18th year; that only natives shall be eligible to any offices of state, exclusive of those immediately appertaining to the king's household; that the yearly revenue of the king shall be 2,000,000 florins, and that the royal residences shall be the palaces of the Hague, in the Wood, and at Soest dyke. The council of state is to consist of 13 members; the general government of the kingdom is to be committed to four ministers of state; and the legislative body is to be composed of 38 members chosen for five years.\n\nThe revenues of the United Provinces arose principally from taxes imposed on each province and city, according\nAccording to their ability. These consisted chiefly of a general excise, a land tax, a poll-tax, and hearth money; and are supposed to have amounted to \u00a33,000,000 sterling.\n\nBefore the French revolution, the Dutch maintained a peace establishment of 30,000 men, which in war was augmented to above 50,000, chiefly by mercenary troops from Germany. Their naval establishment was highly respectable; and at the end of the 17th century it exceeded that of any other maritime power in Europe. Before the late war they could muster 40 sail of the line, 40 frigates, and 10 cutters. Since the celebrated engagement off the Dogger Bank during the American war, the Dutch have been scarcely able to cope with the English at sea; and the victory off Camperdown in October 1797, with the subsequent loss of the Texel fleet in 1799, proved the deathblow to the naval power of Holland.\n\nBefore the late change of government, the established religion of Holland was Presbyterianism, according to the doctrines of Calvin; though all sects of Christians were tolerated. The church was governed by consistories, classes, and synods, from which there was an appeal to one great national synod, subject to the control of the states-general.\n\nThe Dutch language is a dialect of the German, and in many respects bears a considerable resemblance to the Old English and Lowland Scotch. The literature of the United Provinces has long been respectable; and the universities of Leyden, Utrecht, Groningen, Harderwyck, and Franeker, have produced many eminent and celebrated men in almost every department of science. Grotius, Erasmus, Boerhaave, Leuvenhoek, Swammerdam, Gravius, Burman, Hoogwegen, &c., are names mentioned with admiration and respect in the annals of literature.\n\nThe Dutch manufactures consist principally of fine linen, earthenware, chiefly manufactured at Delft, especially white and painted tiles, tobacco-pipes, borax, oil, starch, paper, leather, woollen and cotton cloths, snuff, tobacco, and gin.\n\nThe commerce of the Dutch was formerly more extensive than that of any other country in Europe. They carried on a trade with every quarter of the globe, and in particular their East India Company was perhaps the richest society of merchants in the world. Holland was almost the exclusive centre of the spice trade; and the extensive fisheries on the coast of Greenland and in the North Sea, supplied the greater part of Europe with whale oil and herrings. Besides this external commerce, they carried on a considerable inland traffic with the interior of Germany, from which they brought immense quantities of timber. Vast rafts of trees, many hundred feet in length, set out annually from the forests of Andernach, and other places on the Rhine, and proceeding down the river under the direction of a great body of labourers, that formed a village of huts on the surface of the raft, sailed down the Rhine and the Waal to Dort, where the timber was disposed of, and where one raft has been sold for \u00a330,000 sterling. All the foreign trade of Holland may now be considered as annihilated, but the inland traffic in wood and spirits still continues.\n\nThe inland commerce of the United Provinces is greatly promoted by the facility of conveyance from one part of the country to another, by means of the numerous canals.\n\nThe Dutch are, by constitution, a cool, or rather phlegmatic people, laborious, patient, obstinate, and persevering. When stimulated by any predominant passion, as avarice, or formerly love of liberty, they are capable of great exertions. Economy and order in the management of their pecuniary concerns are common among all classes, with whom it is an established maxim to spend less than their income. Interest and love of money regulate all their actions, and appear to supplant in their breasts every noble and generous feeling. These prominent features in the national character are, of course, modified by the rank or situation of the different orders in society. The higher ranks value themselves much on their distinctions, are reserved to strangers, but affable and obliging to those with whom they have had an opportunity of becoming acquainted; friendly, candid, and sincere. The mercantile men and traders are, in general, fair and honest in their transactions; though their natural thirst of gain sometimes tempts them to deceive and overreach their customers. The lower ranks are ignorant, dull, and slow of apprehension, but open to conviction, and patient of fatigue and labour.\n\nDress, among the Dutch, is regulated less by fashion, manners than by an attention to climate and season. The moist and inclement weather of these require a greater quantity of clothing than is found necessary in other countries under the same latitude; and, among the ordinary classes, broad hats, large breeches and thick boots and shoes, are still almost universal. Most of the women wear hats with low crowns and very broad rims, with jerkins and short petticoats; and, what appears exceedingly ridiculous to strangers, the boys and girls wear the same dress as the men and women.\n\nA close attention to regularity and neatness in the streets and the interior of the houses prevails throughout the United Provinces, but is most conspicuous in North Holland. This was at first rendered necessary by the nature of the climate, to prevent rust and mouldiness from destroying their utensils and furniture, and has since become a habit, conducive at once to comfort and to health. The manner of living in Holland was, till of late, not a little gross. Their diet consisted much of high-seasoned and salted meats, butter, cheese, and spirituous liquors. In no country was gormandizing reduced more to a system. Convivial entertainments were extremely frequent; and the interval between the more substantial meals of dinner, tea, and supper, were filled up with cakes, fruits, jellies, and other light things; not to mention smoking and drinking, which supplied the place of conversation (c). If we may rely on the report of a late writer on the statistics of Holland*, the style of living is now much changed, though not much improved.\n\n---\n\n(c) We must admit, that, in so moist and cold a climate, a full and generous diet may be safe if not necessary; but the Dutch, like many of our own countrymen, absurdly carried the same system into their tropical colonies.\nimproved. Animal food is become extremely rare, and its place is supplied by a greater proportion of gin, tea, and coffee. The prevailing amusements in winter are dramatic entertainments and skating, in which latter they are exceedingly expert.\n\nThe Dutch taste for formal gardens, straight walks, trees and hedges clipped into fantastic shapes, and flower roots, has long been proverbial, and has been treated with more contempt and ridicule than it deserves. At worst, these are but harmless propensities; and, if indulged in moderation, are well suited to relieve the fatigues and inactivity of a retirement from the busy scenes of trade and commerce.","sp":197,"ep":206},{"h":"UNITY","t":"in Poetry.

Universities generally comprehended within them one or more colleges; but this is not always the case; for the university of St Andrew's was in being before either of its colleges was founded, and it would continue in being, with all its privileges, though both its colleges were levelled with the dust.\n\nIn every university with which we are acquainted, there are four faculties, viz. Theology, Law, Physic, and the Arts and Sciences, comprehending mathematics, natural and moral philosophy, &c.; and in Oxford, Cambridge, and some other universities, Music is considered as a fifth faculty. In each of these there are two degrees, those of Bachelor and Doctor; for though in the universities of Great Britain and Ireland we have no such degree as Doctor in Arts and Sciences, our Master of Arts answers to the degree of Doctor in Philosophy, which is conferred by many of the universities on the continent.\n\nUniversities in their present form, and with their present privileges, are institutions comparatively modern. They sprang from the convents of regular clergy, or from the chapters of cathedrals in the church of Rome, where young men were educated for holy orders, in that dark period when the clergy possessed all the little erudition which was left in Europe. These convents were seminaries of learning probably from their first institution; and we know with certainty, that in Old Aberdeen there was a monastery in which youth were instructed in theology, the canon law, and the school philosophy, at least 200 years before the university and King's College were founded. The same was doubtless the case in Oxford and Cambridge, and probably in every town in Europe, where there is now a university which has any claims to be called ancient; for it was not till the more eminent of the laity began to see the importance of literature and science, that universities distinct from convents were founded, with the privilege of admitting to degrees, which conferred some rank in civil society. These universities have long been considered as lay corporations; but as a proof that they had the ecclesiastical origin which we have assigned to them, it will be sufficient to observe, that the pope arrogated to himself the right of vesting them with all their privileges; and that, prior to the Reformation, every university in Europe conferred its degrees in all the faculties by authority derived from a papal bull.\n\nIt is perhaps no improbable conjecture, that the church of Rome derived her idea of academical honours from the Jews, among whom literary distinctions extremely similar subsisted before the nativity of our Saviour. Among them, the young student, with respect to his learning, was called a disciple; from his minority a junior; and the chosen or elected, on account of his election into the number of disciples. When he had made some progress in knowledge, and was deemed worthy of a degree, he was by imposition of hands made \u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05d5\u05bc\u05d9\u05b8\u05d4, a companion to a Rabbi, the person who officiates using this form, I afficiate thee, or, Be thou afficiated; and as soon afterwards as he was thought worthy to teach others, the afficiate was raised to the rank of Rabbi. Whether this process suggested the idea or not, it has certainly some resemblance to that by which a young man in our universities passes through the degree of Bachelor to that of Master of Arts or Doctor.\n\nThe most ancient universities in Europe are those of OXFORD, CAMBRIDGE, PARIS, SALAMANCA, and BOLOGNA; and in the two English universities, the first colleges are those of University, Balliol, and Merton, in the former, and St Peter's in the latter. Oxford and Cambridge, however, were universities, or, as they were then called, studiers, some hundreds of years before colleges or schools were built in them; for the former flourished as a seminary of learning in the reign of Alfred the Great, and the other, could we believe its partial partizans, at a period still earlier. The universities of Scotland are four, ST ANDREWS, GLASGOW, ABERDEEN, and EDINBURGH. In Ireland there is but one university, viz. that of DUBLIN, founded by Queen Elizabeth, and very richly endowed.\n\nAn idle controversy has been agitated, whether the constitution of the English or of the Scotch universities be best adapted to answer the ends of their institution; and, as might be expected, it has been differently decided, according to the partialities of those who have written on the subject. Were we to hazard our own opinion, we should say, that each has its advantages and disadvantages; and that while the English universities, aided\n\nThe account given by a late traveller (see Barrow's Voyage to Cochin-China) of the luxurious mode of living at Batavia, affords a melancholy, but accurate picture of Dutch gluttony.\nUniversity aided by their great schools, to which we have nothing that can be compared, are unquestionably fitted to carry their young members farthest in the knowledge of the learned languages, the mode of teaching in our own universities is better adapted to the promotion of arts and sciences, and the communication of that knowledge which is of most importance in active life.\n\n**University-Court**, in England. The two universities enjoy the sole jurisdiction, in exclusion of the king's courts, over all civil actions and suits whatsoever, where a scholar or privileged person is one of the parties; excepting in such cases where the right of freehold is concerned. And then by the university charter they are at liberty to try and determine, either according to the common law of the land, or according to their own local customs, at their discretion; which has generally led them to carry on their process in a course much conforming to the civil law.\n\nThis privilege, so far as it relates to civil causes, is exercised at Oxford in the chancellor's court; the judge of which is the vice-chancellor, his deputy, or assessor. From his sentence an appeal lies to delegates appointed by the congregation; from thence to other delegates of the house of convocation; and if they all three concur in the same sentence, it is final, at least by the statutes of the university, according to the rule of the civil law. But if there be any discordance or variation in any of the three sentences, an appeal lies in the last resort to judges delegates appointed by the crown, under the great seal in chancery.\n\nAs to the jurisdiction of the university courts in criminal matters, the chancellor's court at Oxford, and probably also that of Cambridge, hath authority to try all offences or misdemeanors under the degree of treason, felony, or mayhem; and the trial of treason, felony, and mayhem, by a particular charter, is committed to the university jurisdiction in another court, namely, the court of the lord high steward of the university.\n\nThe process of the trial is this. The high steward issues one precept to the sheriff of the county, who thereupon returns a panel of 18 freeholders; and another precept to the bedells of the university, who thereupon return a panel of 18 matriculated laymen, *laicos privilegio universitatis gaudentes*: and by a jury formed de mediate, half of freeholders and half matriculated persons, is the indictment to be tried; and that in the guildhall of the city of Oxford. And if execution be necessary to be awarded in consequence of finding the party guilty, the sheriff of the county must execute the university process; to which he is annually bound by an oath.\n\n**Vocabulary**, in Grammar, denotes the collection of the words of a language, with their significations, otherwise called a dictionary, lexicon, or nomenclature.

Voetius had two sons, Daniel and Paul, both authors. John Voetius, the son of Paul, was doctor and professor of law at Herborn, and wrote a commentary on the Pandects.\n\n**Voice**, a sound produced in the throat and mouth of an animal, by peculiar organs.\n\nVoices are either articulate or inarticulate. Articulate voices are those whereof several confine together to form some intelligible or little system of sounds: such are the voices expressing the letters of an alphabet, numbers of which joined together form words. Inarticulate voices are such as are not organized, or assembled into words; such is the barking of dogs, the braying of asses, the hissing of serpents, the fingering of birds, &c.\n\nFor a description of the organs of the voice, see Anatomy; see also Physiology Index.\n\n**Voice**, in Grammar, a circumstance in verbs, whereby they come to be considered as either active or passive, i.e., either expressing an action impressed on another subject, as, I beat; or receiving it from another, as, I am beaten.

It is navigable a few miles above that town. This noble river waters some of the finest provinces in the Russian empire, and at last falls into the Caspian sea by several mouths, below Astracan.\n\nThe Volga is subject to annual inundation. In the year 1774, the inundations exceeded the lowest water-mark by nearly 40 feet, since which period they have been rather on the decline; for in 1775, they rose only to 39 feet 2 inches above that mark; in 1782, they rose to 26 feet; in 1785, to 25 feet 2 inches; and in the year 1791, their height was the same. Pallas is of opinion that this phenomenon may have originated from the diminished quantity of snow and rain which had fallen in the higher countries; from the greater evaporation of the Caspian sea, and the gradual extension of the different mouths of the river, or perhaps from the joint operation of all these causes.\n\n**Volition**,","sp":206,"ep":207},{"h":"URN","t":"URN, a kind of vase, of a roundish form, but biggest in the middle, like the common pitchers; now seldom used but in the way of ornament over chimney-pieces, in buffets, &c.

Another Uz was the son of Nahor, Abraham's brother (Gen. x. 21.), who appears to have removed, after passing the Euphrates, from Haran of Mesopotamia to Arabia Deserta. The third Uz was a Horite, from Mount Seir (Gen. xxxvi. 28.), and thus not of Eber's posterity. Now the question is, from which of these Job's country, Uz, took its name: Not from the first, as is already shown; nor from the second, because his country is always called Seir, or Edom, never Uz; and then called a south, not an east, country, in Scripture. It therefore remains, that we look for the country and place of residence of Job in Arabia Deserta, for which there was very probable reasons. The plunderers of Job are called Chaldeans and Sabeans, next neighbours to him.

But a sudden turn of the wind freed them from this adversary, and cast them upon the coasts of Catalonia, where, after expecting to run aground every moment, they at length fell among the sands at the mouth of the Rhone. Mr Vaillant got to shore in a skiff, but felt himself extremely incumbered with the medals he had swallowed, which might weigh altogether five or six ounces, and therefore did not pass like Scarborough waters. He had recourse to a couple of physicians; who were a little puzzled with the singularity of his case; however, nature relieved him from time to time, and he found himself in possession of the greatest part of his treasure when he got to Lyons.

Their system was this: the first principle is Bythos, i.e., Depth, which remained many ages unknown, having with it Ennoe or Thought, and Sige or Silence; from these sprung the Nous or Intelligence, which is the only son, equal to and alone capable of comprehending the Bythos; the sister of Nous they called Aletheia or Truth; and these constituted the first quaternity of aeons, which were the source and original of all the rest: for Nous and Aletheia produced the World and Life; and from these two proceeded Man and the Church.

After giving early proofs of his genius, he became the disciple of the illustrious Rubens. In the church of the Augustines at Antwerp, at the high altar, is a celebrated picture of Rubens representing, in one part, the Virgin Mary fitting with the child Jesus in her lap, and in another part several saints, male and female, standing. The breast of one of these, St Sebastian, is said to have been painted by Vandyck when he was only a disciple of Rubens. This great master being engaged one day abroad, his disciples went into his painting-room, where, after having been some time employed in admiring his works, they began to play or romp in such a manner, that the breast of St Sebastian, which was not yet dry, was brushed away by a hat thrown at random. This accident put an end to their play: they were very anxious to restore it, fearing that if Rubens discovered it they should all be discarded. At length it was agreed that Anthony should undertake to mend the faint's breast. In short, taking his master's pallet and brushes, he succeeded so well that his companions imagined Rubens would overlook it. They were mistaken; for Rubens at his return knew immediately that someone had touched upon his performance: calling his disciples, he asked them why any one had dared to meddle with his painting? They were some time doubtful whether they should confess or deny the fact. Threats at length prevailed: they owned that Vandyck had thrown his hat upon it. Upon this, closeting Vandyck, instead of chiding him, he told him, that \"it was proper and even necessary for him to travel into Italy, the only school that produced excellent painters.\" By this advice, and with the affluence of his matter, he set out for Italy, about the year 1621, being then about 21 or 22 years of age. Having stayed a short time at Rome, he removed to Venice, where he attained the beautiful colouring of Titian, Paul Veronese, and the Venetian school.\n\nAfter a few years he returned to Flanders, with so noble, so easy, and natural a manner of painting, that Titian himself was hardly his superior: and no other matter could equal him in portraits. Soon after his return, he accidentally met with D. Teniers, who accosted him with great politeness, and asked him whether he had much business since he came from Rome? \"What business, think you, can I have had time to do (replied Vandyck)? I am only just arrived here. Would you believe, that I offered to draw that fat brewer's picture who just passed by us for two pistoles, and that the looby laughed in my face, saying it was too dear? I assure you, that if the cards do not turn up better, I shall make no long stay at Brussels.\" Soon after this, he painted those two famous pictures, the Nativity and a dying Christ; the first in the parish-church, the second Vandyck in that of the Capuchins, at Termond.\n\nVandyck, finding he could not make a fortune in his own country, took a resolution of going over into England. Accordingly he borrowed some guineas of Teniers, and set out, furnished with letters of recommendation. His superior genius soon brought him into great reputation; and above all, he excelled in portraits, which he drew with an inconceivable facility, and for which he charged a very high price, according to the instructions which had been given him on that head. It is affirmed, that for some of them he received 400 guineas apiece. He soon found himself loaded with honours and riches; and as he had a noble and generous heart, he lived equal to his fortune. He married a daughter of the lord Ruthven, earl of Gowry; and, though he had but little fortune, maintained her in a style suitable to her birth. He generally kept a magnificent equipage, and a numerous retinue. He died in 1641, at the age of 42, leaving property, it is said, to the amount of 40,000l. sterling.","sp":139,"ep":139},{"h":"VANE","t":"a thin slip of bunting hung to the mast-head, or some other conspicuous place in the ship, to show the direction of the wind.

On the continent it is called the declination of the magnetic needle; and this is a better term, for reasons which will appear by and by.\n\nWe have given the general facts relating to magnetic variation under the article MAGNETISM, No 19; and under the articles COMPASS, and Azimuth COMPASS, we have noticed the methods of ascertaining the variation at any particular time or place. We shall here only give a short historical account of the progressive discoveries respecting magnetic variation, and notice the\nthe explanations that have been offered to account for this phenomenon.\n\nAbout the time that the polarity of the magnet was first observed in Europe, the magnetic direction, both in Europe and in China, was nearly in the plane of the meridian. It was therefore an infallible present to the mariner, giving him a sure direction in his course through the pathless ocean. But by the time that the European navigators had engaged in their adventurous voyages to far distant shores, the deviation of the needle from the meridian was very sensible even in Europe. The son of Columbus positively says, that it was observed by his father in his first voyage to America, and made his companions so anxious lest they should not find the way back again to their own country, that they mutinied and refused to proceed. It is certain that Gonzales Oviedo and Sebastian Cabot observed it in their voyages. Indeed it could not possibly escape them; for in some parts of their several tracks the needle deviated above $25^\\circ$ from the meridian; and the rudest dead reckoning, made on the supposition of the needle pointing due north and south, must have thrown the navigators into the utmost confusion. We know that spherical trigonometry was at that time abundantly familiar to the mathematicians of Europe, and that no person pretended to take the command of a ship bound to a distant port that was not much more informed in this science than most masters of ships are at present. The deviation of the compass, however, was not generally allowed by mathematicians, who had not yet become sensible of the necessity of quitting the Aristotelian trammels, and investigating nature by experiments. They chose rather to charge the navigators with inaccuracy in their observations than the schoolmen with errors in principles. Pedro de Medina at Valladolid, in his *Arte de Navigar*, published in 1545, denies the variation of the compass. But the concurring reports of the commanders of ships on distant voyages, in a few years, obliged the landmen in their closets to give up the point; and Martin Cortez, in a treatise of navigation, printed at Seville before 1556, treats it as a thing completely established, and gives rules and instruments for discovering its quantity. About the year 1580 Norman published his discovery of the dip of the needle, and speaks largely of the horizontal deviation from the plane of the meridian, and attributes it to the attraction of a point, not in the heavens, but in the earth, and describes methods by which he hoped to find its place. To the third, and all the subsequent editions of Norman's book (called the *New Attractive*), was subjoined a dissertation by Mr Burroughs, comptroller of the navy, on the variation of the compass, in which are recorded the quantity of this deviation in many places; and he laments the obstacle which it causes to navigation by its total uncertainty previous to observation. The author indeed offers a rule for computing it, *a priori*, founded on some conjecture as to its cause; but, with the modesty and candour of a gentleman, acknowledges that this is but a guess, and intreates all navigators to be judicious in their observations, and ready in communicating them to the public. Accordingly observations were liberally contributed from time to time, and were published in the subsequent treatises on navigation.\n\nBut in 1635 the mariners were thrown into a new and great perplexity, by the publication of a *Discourse*\n\nMathematical on the Variation of the Magnetic Needle, Variation by Mr Henry Gillebrand, Greatham professor of astronomy. He had compared the variations observed at London by Burroughs, Gunter, and himself, and found that the north end of the mariner's needle was gradually drawing more to the westward. For Norman and Burroughs had observed it to point about $11\\frac{1}{2}$ degrees to the east of north in 1580; Gunter found its deviation only $6^\\circ$ in 1622, and he himself had observed only $4^\\circ$ in 1634; and it has been found to deviate more and more to the westward ever since, as may be seen from the tables given under MAGNETISM.\n\nMr Bond, teacher of mathematics in London, and employed to edit and improve the impressions of the popular treatises of navigation, about 1650, declared, in a work called the \"Seaman's Kalendar,\" that he had discovered the true progress of the deviation of the compass; and published in another work, called the \"Longitude Found,\" a table of the variation for 50 years. This was, however, a gratuitous prognostication, not founded on any well-grounded principles; and though it agreed very well with the observations made in London, which showed a gradual motion to the westward at the rate of $-12'$ annually, by no means agreed with the observations made in other places. See Phil. Trans. 1668.\n\nBut this news soon lost its credit: for the inconsistency with observation appeared more and more every day, and all were anxious to differ over some general rule, by which a near guess at least might be made as to the direction of the needle in the most frequented seas. Halley recommended the matter in the most earnest manner to the attention of government; and, after much unwearyed solicitation, obtained a ship to be sent on a voyage of discovery for this purpose. He got the command of this ship, in which he repeatedly traversed the Atlantic ocean, and went as far as the 50th degree of southern latitude. See his very curious speculations on this subject in the Phil. Trans. 1683 and 1692.\n\nAfter he had collected a prodigious number of observations made by others, and compared them with his own, he published in 1700 a synoptical account of them in a very ingenious form of a sea chart, where the ocean was criss-crossed by a number of lines passing through those planes where the compass had the same deviation. Thus, in every point of one line there was no variation in 1700; in every point of another line the compass had $20^\\circ$ of east variation; and in every point of a third line it had $20^\\circ$ of west variation. These lines have since been called *Halleyan lines*, or curves. This chart was received with universal applause, and was undoubtedly one of the most valuable presents that science has made to the arts.\n\nThe polarity of the magnetic needle, and a general though intricate connection between its positions in all parts of the world, naturally makes the philosopher speculate about its cause. We see that Cortez ascribed it to the attraction of an eccentric point, and that Bond thought that this point was placed not in the heavens, but in the earth. This notion made the basis of the famous Theory of Magnetism of Dr Gilbert of Colchester. See MAGNETISM, No. 71.\n\nGilbert's theory may be understood from the following general proposition.\n\nLet NS (fig. 1.) be a magnet, of which N is the north Fig. 1.\nVariation. North and S the south pole: Let \\( ns \\) be any oblong piece of iron, poised on a point \\( c \\) like a compass needle. It will arrange itself in a position \\( nc \\) precisely the same with that which would be afforded by a compass needle of the same size and shape, having \\( n \\) for its north and \\( s \\) its south pole. And while the piece of iron remains in this position, it will be in all respects a magnet similar to the real compass needle. The pole \\( n \\) will attract the south pole of a small magnetized needle, and repel its north pole. If a paper be held over \\( ns \\), and fine iron-filings be strewned on it, they will arrange themselves into curves issuing from one of its ends and terminating at the other, in the same manner as they will do when strewned on a paper held over a real compass needle. But this magnetism is quite temporary; for if the piece of iron \\( ns \\) be turned the other way, placing \\( n \\) where \\( s \\) now is, it will remain there, and will exhibit the same phenomena. We may here add, that if \\( ns \\) be almost infinitely small in comparison of NS, the line \\( ns \\) will be in such a position that if \\( sa \\), \\( sb \\), be drawn parallel to \\( nc \\), \\( sc \\), we shall have \\( sa \\) to \\( sb \\), as the force of the pole \\( N \\) to the force of the pole \\( S \\). And this is the true cause of that curious disposition of iron-filings when strewn round a magnet. Each fragment becomes a momentary magnet, and arranges itself in the true magnetic direction, and when so arranged, attracts the two adjoining fragments, and co-operates with the forces, which also arrange them. We throw this out to the ingenious mechanician as the foundation of a complete theory of the magnetic phenomena.\n\nWhen the filings are infinitely fine, the curves \\( nc \\) have this property, that, drawing the tangent \\( nc \\), we always have \\( sa \\cdot sb = \\text{force of } N : \\text{force of } S \\); and thus we may approximate at pleasure to the law of magnetic attraction and repulsion. The theory, of which an outline is given under Magnetism, is founded on this principle, and applies with success to every phenomenon yet observed.\n\nNow, to apply this theory to the point in hand.\u2014Let \\( ns \\) (fig. 2.) be a small compass needle, of which \\( n \\) is the north and \\( s \\) the south pole: let this needle be poised horizontally on the pin \\( cd \\); and let \\( ns' \\) be the position of the dipping needle. Take any long bar of common iron, and hold it upright, or nearly so, as represented by \\( AB \\). The lower end \\( B \\) will repel the pole \\( n \\) and will attract the pole \\( s \\), thus exhibiting the properties of a north pole of the bar \\( AB \\). Keeping \\( B \\) in its place, turn the bar round \\( B' \\) as a centre, till it come into the position \\( A'B' \\) nearly parallel to \\( ns' \\). You will observe the compass needle \\( ns \\) attract the end \\( B' \\) with either pole \\( n \\) or \\( s \\), when \\( B'A' \\) is in the position \\( B'a \\) perpendicular to the direction \\( ns' \\) of the dipping needle: and when the bar has come into the position \\( B'A' \\), the upper end \\( B' \\) will show itself to be a south pole by attracting \\( n \\) and repelling \\( s \\). This beautiful experiment was exhibited to the Royal Society in 1673 by Mrs Hindshaw.\n\nFrom this it appears, that the great magnet in the earth induces a momentary magnetism on soft iron precisely as a common magnet would do. Therefore (says Dr Gilbert) it induces permanent magnetism on magnetizable ores of iron, such as loadstones, in the same manner as a great loadstone would do; and it affects the magnetism already imparted to a piece of tempered steel precisely as any other great magnet would.\n\nVol. XX. Part II.\n\nTherefore the needle of the mariner's compass in every part of the world arranges itself in the magnetic direction, so that if poised as a dipping needle should be, it will be a tangent to one of the curves \\( ncS \\) of fig. 1. The horizontal needle being so poised as to be capable of playing only in a horizontal plane, will only arrange itself in the plane of the triangle \\( ncS \\). That end of it which has the same magnetism with the south pole \\( S \\) of the great magnet included in the earth will be turned towards its north pole \\( N \\). Therefore what we call the north pole of a needle or magnet really has the magnetism of the south pole of the great primitive magnet. If the line \\( NS \\) be called the axis, and \\( N \\) and \\( S \\) the poles of this great magnet, the plane of any one of these curves \\( ncS \\) will cut the earth's surface in the circumference of a circle, great or small according as the plane does or does not pass through the centre of the earth.\n\nDr Halley's first thought was, that the north pole of the great magnet or loadstone which was included in the bowels of the earth was not far from Baffin's bay, and its south pole in the Indian ocean south-west from New Zealand. But he could not find any positions of these two poles which would give the needle that particular position which it was observed to assume in different parts of the world; and he concluded that the great terrestrial loadstone had four irregular poles (a thing not unfrequent in natural loadstones, and easily producible at pleasure), two of which are stronger and two weaker. When the compass is at a great distance from the two north poles, it is affected so as to be directed nearly in a plane passing through the strongest. But if we make it approach much more to the weakest, the greater vicinity will compensate for the smaller absolute force of the weak pole, and occasion considerable irregularities. The appearances are favourable to this opinion. If this be the real constitution of the great magnet, it is almost a desperate task to ascertain by computation what will be the position of the needle. Halley seems to have despaired: for he was both an elegant and a most expert mathematician, and it would have cost him little trouble to ascertain the places of two poles only, and the direction which these would have given to the needle. But to say what would be its position when acted on by four poles, it was necessary to know the law by which the magnetic action varied by a variation of distance; and even then, the computation would have been exceedingly difficult.\n\nIn order to account for the change of variation, Dr Halley supposes this internal magnet not to adhere to the external shell which we inhabit, but to form a nucleus or kernel detached from it on all sides, and to be so poised as to revolve freely round an axis, the position of which he hopes to discover by observation of the compass. Dr Halley imagined that the nucleus revolved from east to west round the same axis with the earth. Thus the poles of the magnet would change their positions relatively to the earth's surface, and this would change the direction of the compass needle.\n\nThe great Euler, whose delight it was always to engage in the most difficult mathematical researches and computations, undertook to ascertain the position of the needle in every part of the earth. His dissertation on this subject is to be seen in the 13th volume of the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Berlin, and is exceedingly\nVariation, irgly beautiful, abounding in those analytical tours d'adrefle in which he surpassed all the world. He has reduced the computation to a wonderful simplicity.\n\nHe found, however, that four poles would engage him in an analysis which would be excessively intricate, and has contented himself with computing for two only; observing that this supposition agrees so well with observation, that it is highly probable that this is the real constitution of the terrestrial magnet, and that the coincidence would have been perfect if he had hit on the due positions of the two poles. He places one of them in lat. 76\u00b0 north, and long. 96\u00b0 west from Teneriffe. The fourth pole is placed in lat. 38\u00b0 south, and long. 158\u00b0 west from Teneriffe. These are their situations for 1757.\u2014Mr Euler has annexed to his dissertation a chart of Halleyan curves suited to these assumptions, and fitted to the year 1757.\n\nIt must be acknowledged, that the general course of the variations according to this theory greatly resembles the real state of things; and we cannot but own ourselves highly indebted to this great mathematician for having made so fine a first attempt. He has improved it very considerably in another dissertation in the 22d volume of these memoirs. But there are still such great differences, that the theory is of no use to the navigator, and it only serves as an excellent model for a farther prosecution of the subject. Since that time another large variation chart has been published, fitted to a late period; but the public has not sufficient information of the authorities or observations on which it is founded.\n\nThe great object in all these charts is to facilitate the discovery of a ship's longitude at sea. For the lines of variation being drawn on the chart, and the variation and the latitude being observed at sea, we have only to look on the chart for the intersection of the parallel of observed latitude and the Halleyan curve of observed variation. This intersection must be the place of the ship. This being the purpose, the Halleyan lines are of great service; but they do not give us a ready conception of the direction of the needle. We have always to imagine a line drawn through the point, cutting the meridian in the angle corresponding to the Halleyan line. We should learn the general magnetic affections of the globe much better if a number of magnetic meridians were drawn. These are the intersections of the earth's surface with planes passing through the magnetic axis, cutting one another in angles of 9\u00b0 or 10\u00b0. This would both show us the places of the magnetic poles much more clearly, and would, in every place, show us at once the direction of the needle. In all those places where these magnetic curves touch the meridians, there is no variation; and the variation in every other place is the angle contained between these magnetic meridians and the true ones.\n\nThe program of a work of this kind has been published by Mr Churchman, who appears to have engaged in the investigation with great zeal and considerable opportunities. It is pretty certain that the north magnetic pole (or point, as Mr Churchman calls it) is not far removed from the stations given it by Halley and Euler; and there seems no doubt but that in the countries between Hudson's bay and the western coasts of North America the needle will have every position with respect to the terrestrial meridian, so that the north end of a compass needle will even point due south in several places. Almost everything that can be desired in this inquiry would be obtained by a few well-chosen observations made in those regions. It would be of immense advantage to have the dips ascertained with great precision. These would enable us to judge at what depth under the surface the pole is situated; for the well-informed mechanician, who will study seriously what we have said about the magnetic curves, will see that a compass needle, when compared with the great terrestrial magnet, is but as a particle of iron-filings compared to a very large artificial magnet. Therefore, from the position of the dipping needle, we may infer the place of the pole, if the law of magnetic action be given; and this law may be found by means of other experiments which we could point out. See MAGNETISM, No 89, &c., &c.\n\nMr Churchman has adopted the opinion of only two poles. According to him, the north pole was (in 1800) in Lat. 58\u00b0 N. and Long. 134\u00b0 W. from Greenwich, very near Cape Fairweather; and the south pole lies in Lat. 58\u00b0 S. and Long. 165\u00b0 E. from Greenwich. He also imagines that the north pole has moved to the eastward, on a parallel of latitude, about 65 since the beginning of the 19th century (from 1800), and concludes that it makes a revolution in 1096 years. The southern pole has moved less, and completes its revolution in 2280 years. This motion he attributes to some influences which he calls magnetic tides, and which he seems to consider as celestial. This he infers from the changes of variation. He announces a physical theory on this subject, which, he says, enables him to compute the variation with precision for any time past or to come; and he even gives the process of trigonometrical computation illustrated by examples. But as this publication (entitled The Magnetic Atlas), published for the author, by Darton and Harvey, 1794, is only a program, he expresses himself obscurely, and somewhat enigmatically, respecting his theory. He speaks of the influence of one pole being greater than that of the other; and says, that in this case the magnetic equator, where the needle will be parallel to the axis, will not be in the middle between the poles. This is true of a common magnet. He must therefore abide by this supposition in its other consequences. The magnetic meridians must be planes passing through this axis, and therefore must be circles on the surface of the earth. This is incompatible with the observations; nay, his charts are so in many places, particularly in the Pacific ocean, where the variations by his chart are three times greater than what has been observed.\u2014His parallels of dip are still more different from observation, and are incompatible with any phenomena that could be produced by a magnet having but two poles. His rules of computation are exceedingly exceptionable. He has in fact but one example, and that so particular, that the mode of computation will not apply to any other. This circumstance is not taken notice of in the enunciation of his first problem; and the reader is made to imagine that he has got a rule for computing the variation, whereas all the rules of calculation are only running in a circle. The variation computed for the port of St Peter and Paul in Kamtschatka, by the rule, is ten times greater than the truth.\n\nFor our own part, we have little hopes of this problem ever being subjected to accurate calculation. We believe,\nVariation, believe, indeed, that there is a cofinical change going on in the earth, which will produce a progressive change in the variation of the needle; and we see none more likely than Dr Halley's motion. There is nothing repugnant to our knowledge of the universe in the supposition of a magnetic nucleus revolving within this earth; and it is very easy to conceive a very simple motion of revolution, which shall produce the very motion of the sensible poles for which Mr Churchman contends. We need only suppose that the magnetical axis of this nucleus is not its axis of revolution. It may not even bifurcate that axis; and this circumstance will cause the two poles to have different degrees of motion in relation to the shell which surrounds it.\n\nBut this regular progress of the magnet within the earth may produce very irregular motions of the compass needle, by the intervention of a third body susceptible of magnetism. The theory of which we have just given a hint comes here to our assistance. Suppose NS (fig. 3.) to represent the primitive magnet in the earth, and NS' to be a stratum of iron ore susceptible of magnetism. Also let NS' be another small mass of a similar ore; and let their situations and magnitudes be such as is exhibited in the figure. The fact will be, that N will be the north pole and S the south pole of the great stratum, and NS' and NS' will be the north and south poles of the small mass or loadstone. Any person may remove all doubts as to this, by making the experiment with a magnet NS, a piece of iron or soft tempered steel NS', and another piece NS'. The well-informed and attentive reader will easily see, that by such interventions every conceivable anomaly may be produced. While the great magnet makes a revolution in any direction, the needle will change its position gradually, and with a certain regularity; but it will depend entirely on the size, shape, and situation, of these intervening masses of magnetizable iron ore, whether the change of variation of the compass shall be such as the primitive magnet alone would have produced, or whether it shall be of a kind wholly different.\n\nNow, that such intervening disturbances may exist, is past contradiction. We know that even on the film of earth which we inhabit, and with which only we are acquainted, there are extensive strata or otherwise disposed masses of iron ores in a state susceptible of magnetism; and experiments made on bars of hard tempered steel, and on bits of such ores, assure us that the magnetism is not induced on such bodies in a moment, but propagated gradually along the mass.\u2014That such disturbances do actually exist, we have many relations. There are many instances on record of very extensive magnetic rocks, which affect the needle to very considerable distances. The island of Elba in the Mediterranean is a very remarkable instance of this. The island of Canna also, on the west of Scotland, has rocks which affect the needle at a great distance.\n\nA similar effect is observed near the Faroe islands in the North sea; the compass has no determined direction when brought on shore. Journ. de Sciences, 1679, p. 174.\n\nIn Hudson's straits, in latitude 63\u00b0, the needle has hardly any polarity. Elliot's Voyage to Hudson's Bay.\n\nBouguer observed the same thing in Peru. Nay, we believe that almost all rocks, especially of whin or trappe stone, contain iron in a proper state.\n\nAll this refers only to the thin crust through which Variation, the human eye has occasionally penetrated. Of what may be below we are ignorant; but when we see appearances which tally so remarkably with what would be the effects of great masses of magnetical bodies, modifying the general and regularly progressive action of a primitive magnet, whose existence and motion is inconsistent with nothing that we know of this globe, this manner of accounting for the observed change of variation has all the probability that we can desire. Nay, we apprehend that very considerable changes may be produced in the direction of the compass needle, even without the supposition of any internal motion. If the great magnet resembles many loadstones we are acquainted with, having more than two poles, we know that these poles will act on each other, and gradually change each other's force, and consequently the direction of the compass. This process, to be sure, tends to a state of things which will change no more.\u2014But the period of human history, or of the history of the race of Adam, may make but a small part of the history of this globe; and therefore this objection is of little force.\n\nThere can be no doubt of the operation of the general terrestrial magnetism on everything susceptible of magnetic properties; and we cannot hesitate to explain in this way many changes of magnetic direction which have been observed. Thus, in Italy, Father de la Torre observed, that during a great eruption of Vesuvius the variation was 16\u00b0 in the morning, at noon it was 14\u00b0, and in the evening it was 10\u00b0, and that it continued in that state till the lava grew so dark as no longer to be visible in the night; after which it slowly increased to 13\u00bd\u00b0, where it remained. Daniel Bernoulli found the needle changed its position 45' by an earthquake. Professor Muller at Mainz observed that the declination of the needle in that place was greatly affected by the earthquake in Calabria. Such streams of lava as flowed from Hecla in the last dreadful eruption must have made a transference of magnetic matter that would considerably affect the needle. But no observations seem to have been made on the occasion; for we know that common ironstone, which has no effect on the needle, will, by mere cementation with any inflammable substance, become magnetic. In this way Dr Knight sometimes made artificial loadstones.\u2014But these are partial things, and not connected with the general change of variation now under consideration.\n\nWe have said so much on this subject, chiefly with the view of cautioning our readers against too languid expectations from any pretensions to the solution of this great problem. We may certainly gather from these observations, that even although the theory of the variation should be completed, we must expect (by what we already know of magnetism in general) that the disturbances of the needle, by local causes intervening between it and the great influence by which it is chiefly directed, may be so considerable as to affect the position of the compass needle in a very sensible manner; for we know that the metallic substances in the bowels of the earth are in a state of continual change, and this to an extent altogether unknown.\n\nThere is another irregularity of the mariner's needle that we have noticed under Magnetism, p. 365, namely, the daily variation. This was first observed\nVariation by Mr George Graham in 1722 (Philosophical Transactions, No 383), and reported to the Royal Society of London. It usually moves (at least in Europe) to the westward from 8 morning till 2 P.M. and then gradually returns to its former situation. The diurnal variations are seldom less than 6\u00b0, and often much greater. Mr Graham mentions (Philosophical Transactions, No 428.) some observations by a Captain Hume, in a voyage to America, where he found the variation greatest in the afternoon. This being a general phenomenon, has also attracted the attention of philosophers. The most detailed accounts of it to be met with are those of Mr Canton (see Magnetism), in Philosophical Transactions, vol. ii., part i., p. 399, and those of Van Swinden, in his Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism.\n\nMr Canton attempts to account for these changes of position, by observing that the force of a magnet is weakened by heat. A small magnet being placed near a compass needle, ENE from it, so as to make it deflect 45\u00b0 from the natural position, the magnet was covered with a brass vessel, into which hot water was poured. The needle gradually receded from the magnet 45\u00b0, and returned gradually to its place as the water cooled. This is confirmed by uniform experience.\n\nThe parts of the earth to the eastward are first heated in the morning, and therefore the force of the earth is weakened, and the needle is made to move to the westward. But as the sun warms the western side of the earth in the afternoon, the motion of the needle must take the contrary direction.\n\nBut this way of explaining by a change in the force of the earth supposes that the changing cause is acting in opposition to some other force. We do not know of any such. The force, whatever it may be, seems simply to produce its own effect, in deranging the needle from the direction of terrestrial magnetism. If \u00c6pinus's theory of magnetic action be admitted, we may suppose that the sun acts on the earth as a magnet acts on a piece of soft iron, and in the morning propels the fluid in the north-west parts. The needle directs itself to this constricted fluid, and therefore it points to the eastward of the magnetic north in the afternoon. And (to abide by the same theory) this induced magnetism will be somewhat greater when the earth is warmer; and therefore the diurnal variation will be greatest in summer. This change of position of the constricted fluid must be supposed to bear a very small ratio to the whole fluid, which is naturally supposed to be constricted in one pole of the great magnet in order to give it magnetism. Thus we shall have the diurnal variation a very small quantity. This is departing, however, from the principle of Mr Canton's explanation; and indeed we cannot see how the weakening the general force of the terrestrial magnet should make any change in the needle in respect to its direction; nor does it appear probable that the change of temperature produced by the sun will penetrate deep enough to produce any sensible effect on the magnetism. And if this be the cause, we think that the derangements of the needle should vary as the thermometer varies, which is not true. The other method of explaining is much better, if \u00c6pinus's theory of magnetic attraction and repulsion be just; and we may suppose that it is only the secondary magnetism (i.e., that of the magnetizable minerals) that is sensibly affected by the heat; this will account very well for the greater mobility of the fluid in summer than in winter.\n\nA great objection to either of these explanations is the prodigious diversity of the diurnal variations in different places. This is so very great, that we can scarcely ascribe the diurnal variation to any change in the magnetism of the primitive terrestrial magnet, and must rather look for its cause in local circumstances. This conclusion becomes more probable, when we learn that the deviation from the meridian and the deviation from the horizontal line are not affected at the same time. Van Swinden ascribes them solely to changes produced on the needles themselves. If their magnetism be greatly deranged by the sun's position, it may throw the magnetic centre away from the centre of the needle's motion, and thus produce a very small change of position. But if this be the cause, we should expect differences in different needles. Van Swinden says, that there are such, and that they are very great; but as he has not specified them, we cannot draw any conclusion.\n\nBut, besides this regular diurnal variation, there is another, which is subjected to no rule. The aurora borealis is observed (in Europe) to disturb the needle exceedingly, sometimes drawing it several degrees from its position. It is always observed to increase its deviation from the meridian, that is, an aurora borealis makes the needle point more westerly. This disturbance sometimes amounts to six or seven degrees, and is generally observed to be greatest when the aurora borealis is most remarkable.\n\nThe observation of the connection of the polarity of the needle with the aurora borealis occurred to the late Professor Robison in 1759, when a midshipman on board the Royal William in the river St Lawrence. The point of the heavens to which all the rays of light converged was precisely that which was opposite to the south end of the dipping needle.\n\nThis is a very curious phenomenon, and we have not been able to find any connection between this meteor and the position of a magnetic needle. It is to be observed, that a needle of copper or wood, or any substance except iron, is not affected. We long thought it an electric phenomenon, and that the needle was affected as any other body balanced in the same manner would be; but a copper needle would then be affected.\n\nWe see the needle frequently disturbed both from its general annual position, and from the change made on it by the diurnal variation. This is probably the effect of aurora borealis which are invisible, either on account of thick weather or daylight. Van Swinden says, he seldom or never failed to observe aurora borealis immediately after any anomalous motion of the needle; and concluded that there had been one at the time, though he could not see it. Since no needle but a magnetic one is affected by the aurora borealis, we may conclude that there is some natural connection between this meteor and magnetism. This should farther incite us to observe the circumstance above mentioned, viz., that the south end of the dipping needle points to that part of the heavens where the rays of the aurora appear to.\nVariation to converge. We wish that this were diligently observed in places which have very different variation and dip of the mariner's needle.\n\nFor the diurnal and this irregular variation, consult the Dissertations of Celsius and of Hiotter, in the Memoirs of Stockholm; Wargentin, Philosophical Transactions, vol. xlviii.; Braun (Comment.

It must exclude the action of the air; because wood and metals are varnished to defend them from decay and rust. 2. It must resist water; for otherwise the effect of the varnish could not be permanent. 3. It ought not to alter such colours as are intended to be preserved by this means. It is necessary therefore that a varnish should be easily extended or spread over the surface, without leaving pores or cavities; that it should not crack or scale; and that it should resist water. Now resins are the only bodies that possess these properties. Resins consequently must be used as the bases of varnish. The question which of course presents itself must then be, how to dispose them for this use? and for this purpose they must be dissolved, as minutely divided as possible, and combined in such a manner that the imperfections of those which might be dissolved to scale may be corrected by others.\n\nResins may be dissolved by three agents. 1. By fixed oil. 2. By volatile oil. 3. By alcohol. And accordingly we have three kinds of varnish: the fat or oily varnish, essential varnish, and spirit varnish. Before a resin is dissolved in a fixed oil, it is necessary to render the oil drying. For this purpose the oil is boiled with metallic oxides; in which operation the mucilage of the oil combines with the metal, while the oil itself unites with the oxygen of the oxide. To accelerate the drying of this varnish, it is necessary to add oil of turpentine. The essential varnishes consist of a solution of resin in oil of turpentine. The varnish being applied, the essential oil flies off, and leaves the resin. This is used only for paintings. When resins are dissolved in alcohol, the varnish dries very speedily, and is subject to crack; but this fault is corrected by adding a small quantity of turpentine to the mixture, which renders it brighter, and less brittle when dry.\n\nWe shall now give the method of preparing a number of varnishes for different purposes.\n\nA Varnish for Toilet-boxes, Cases, Fans, &c.\u2014Dissolve two ounces of gum mastic and eight ounces of gum sandarach in a quart of alcohol; then add four ounces of Venice turpentine.\n\nA Varnish for Wainscots, Cane-chairs, Iron-chairs, Graters.\u2014Dissolve in a quart of alcohol eight ounces of gum sandarach, two ounces of seed lac, four ounces of rosin; then add six ounces of Venice turpentine. If the varnish is wished to produce a red colour, more of the lac and less of sandarach should be used, and a little dragon's blood should be added. This varnish is so thick that two layers of it are equal to four or five of another.\n\nA Varnish for Fiddles, and other Musical Instruments.\u2014Put four ounces of gum sandarach, two ounces of lac, two ounces of gum mastic, an ounce of gum elemi, into a quart of alcohol, and hang them over a slow fire till they are dissolved; then add two ounces of turpentine.\n\nVarnish in order to employ Vermilion for painting Equipages.\u2014Dissolve in a quart of alcohol six ounces of sandarach, three ounces of gum lac, and four ounces of rosin; afterwards add six ounces of the cheapest kind of turpentine; mix with it a proper quantity of vermilion when it is to be used.\n\nGold-coloured Varnish.\u2014Pound separately four ounces of flick lac, four ounces of gamboge, four ounces of dragon's blood, four ounces of annatto, and one ounce of saffron: put each of them separately into a quart of alcohol, and expose them for five days in a narrow-mouthed bottle to the sun, or keep them during that time in a very warm room, shaking them every now and then to hasten the solution. When they are all melted, mix them together. More or less of each of these ingredients will give the different tints of gold according as they are combined. In order to make silver imitate gold exactly when covered with this varnish, the quantity of ingredients must be somewhat greater. The method of gilding silver-leaf, &c. with this varnish is as follows: The silver-leaf being fixed on the subject, in the same manner as gold-leaf, by the interposition of proper glutinous matters, the varnish is spread upon the piece with a brush or pencil. The first coat being dry, the piece is again and again washed over with the varnish till the colour appears sufficiently deep. What is called gilt leather, and many picture frames, have no other than this counterfeit gilding. Washing them with a little rectified spirit of wine affords a proof of this; the spirit dissolving the varnish, and leaving the silver-leaf of its own whiteness. For plain frames, thick tin foil may be used instead of silver. The tin-leaf, fixed on the piece with glue, is to be burnished, then polished with emery and a fine linen cloth, and afterwards with putty applied in the same manner: being then lacquered over with the varnish five or six times, it looks very nearly like burnished gold. The same varnish, made with a less proportion of the colouring materials, is applied also on works of brass; both for heightening the colour of the metal to a resemblance with that of gold, and...\nVarnish and for preserving it from being tarnished or corroded by the air.\n\nOil Varnishes.\u2014Gum copal and amber are the substances principally employed in oil varnishes; they possess the properties necessary for varnishes, solidity and transparency.\u2014The copal being whitest, is used for varnishing light, the amber for dark colours. It is best to dissolve them before mixing them with the oil, because by this means they are in less danger of being scorched, and at the same time the varnish is more beautiful. They should be melted in a pot on the fire; they are in a proper state for receiving the oil when they give no resistance to the iron spatula, and when they run off from it drop by drop. The oil employed should be a drying oil, and perfectly free from grease. It should be poured into the copal or amber by little and little, constantly stirring the ingredients at the same time with the spatula. When the oil is well mixed with the copal or amber, take it off the fire; and when it is pretty cool, pour in a greater quantity of the essence of turpentine than the oil that was used. After the varnish is made, it should be passed through a linen cloth. Oil varnishes become thick by keeping; but when they are to be used, it is only necessary to pour in a little essence of turpentine, and to put them for a little on the fire. The turpentine is necessary in oil varnishes to make them dry properly; generally twice as much of it is used as of oil. Less is necessary in summer than in winter. Too much oil hinders the varnish from drying; but when too little is used, it cracks and does not spread properly. We shall subjoin the most useful oil varnishes:\n\nWhite Copal Varnish.\u2014On 16 ounces of melted copal pour four, six, or eight ounces of linseed oil, boiled and quite free from grease. When they are well mixed, take them off the fire (not forgetting to stir them properly); and when pretty cool, pour in 16 ounces of the essence of Venice turpentine. Pass the varnish through a cloth.\u2014Amber varnish is made in the same way.\n\nBlack Varnish for Coaches and Iron Work.\u2014This varnish is composed of bitumen of Palestine, rosin, and amber, melted separately, and afterwards mixed: the oil is then added, and afterwards the turpentine, as directed above. The usual proportions are, 12 ounces of amber, two ounces of rosin, two ounces of bitumen, six of oil, and 12 of the essence of turpentine.\u2014Golden-coloured varnish may be made also by substituting linseed oil for alcohol.\n\nEssential Oil Varnishes.\u2014The only essential oil varnishes used are for pictures. Picture varnishes should be white, light, and quite transparent, which will preserve the colours without giving them any disagreeable tint; and it should be possible to take them off the picture without injuring it. They are usually made of gum mastic and turpentine dissolved together in some essential oil. The varnish is passed through a cloth, and allowed to clarify. It is applied cold to the picture.\n\nVarnish for Glass, in order to preserve it from the Rays of the Sun.\u2014Pulverise a quantity of gum adragant, and let it dissolve for 24 hours in the white of eggs well beat up; then rub it gently on the glass with a brush.\n\nVarnishes before they are used should be carefully kept from dust, which would spoil them; and they should be kept in a vessel quite clean and dry. When used, they should be lifted lightly with a brush, and spread upon a ground altogether free from dirt and moisture. The substance, after being varnished, should be exposed to the heat of the sun, or placed in a warm room covered with a glass case, to keep out all filth. Oil varnishes require more heat than alcohol varnishes. The varnish should be put on very quickly, making great strokes with the pencil or brush, taking care that these strokes never cross one another; it should be spread equally, and never thicker than a leaf of paper; a second coat should not be put on till the first is quite dry. If the varnish, after being put on, becomes dull and uneven, it must be taken off entirely, and new varnish put on.\n\nWhen window-panes are to be varnished, it is first painted of a wooden colour. This colour is made by infusing in water either red or yellow ochre (according to the colour wished for), terra umbra (a kind of ochre) and white lead; into this as much as necessary is put of parchment paste. Two thin coats of this are to be put on, and, after they are quite dry, the varnish.\n\nVarnishes are polished with pumice-stone and tripoli earth. The pumice-stone must be reduced to an impalpable powder, and put upon a piece of serge moistened with water; with this the varnished substance is to be rubbed lightly and equally. The tripoli must also be reduced to a very fine powder, and put upon a clean woollen cloth moistened with olive oil, with which the polishing is to be performed. The varnish is then to be wiped with soft linen, and, when quite dry, cleaned with starch or Spanish white, and rubbed with the palm of the hand or with a linen cloth.\n\nTo recover colours or varnish, and to take off the dirt and filth which may adhere to them, a ley is used made of potash and the ashes of lees of wine. Take 48 ounces of potash, and 16 of the above-mentioned ashes, and put them into six quarts of water, and the ley is made: instead of the ashes an equal quantity of potash would probably do as well. To clean dirty colours, dilute some of this ley with four times its quantity of water, and rub the picture with it; then wash it with river water; and when dry, give it a coat or two of varnish. In order to take off a varnish, wash it with the above-mentioned ley, then with water, and then lift it off the substance on which it was with any iron instrument.\u2014We shall finish this article with a description of the famous Chinese varnish.\n\nThe Chinese varnish is not a composition, but a resin which exudes from a tree called in China shi-chu, \"varnish tree.\" This tree grows in several provinces of the southern parts of China. The Chinese take the following method of propagating this tree: In spring they choose a vigorous shoot about a foot in length, which proceeds immediately from the trunk; and coat over the lower part, by which it adheres to the tree, with a kind of yellow earth, at least three inches in thickness. This coat is carefully covered with a mat, to defend it from rain and the injuries of the air. Towards the autumnal equinox they detach a little of the earth, to observe in what condition the small roots are, which begin to spring forth from the shoot. If they find that the filaments which compose them are of a reddish colour, they judge it is time to make an amputation; but they defer it if the roots are white, because this colour shows\nthat they are yet too tender; they then close up the coat again, and wait till the spring following. When the float is separated from the trunk of the tree, it is put into the earth; but in whatever season it is planted, whether in spring or autumn, great care must be taken to put plenty of cinders into the hole prepared for it; without this precaution the ants would destroy the yet tender roots, or at least deprive them of all their moisture, and cause them to decay.\n\nThe Chinese do not procure varnish from the tsi-chu until its trunk is nearly five inches in diameter, which size it seldom attains to before seven or eight years. Varnish extracted from a tree smaller or of less age would not have the same body and splendor. This liquor distills only in the night time, and during the summer season. To cause the gum to flow, they make several rows of incisions round the trunk, the number of which is proportioned to the vigour of the tree. The first row is seven inches from the earth, and the rest are at the same distance one from the other, and continue to the top of the trunk, and even sometimes on the boughs which are of sufficient strength and size. The Chinese use a crooked iron for making these incisions, which must run a little obliquely, and be equal in depth to the thickness of the bark; they make them with one hand, and with the other hold a shell, the edges of which they insert into the opening, where it remains without any support. These incisions are made towards evening, and next morning they collect the varnish which has fallen into the shells; the following evening they are again inserted, and this operation is continued until the end of summer. A thousand trees yield almost in one night 25 pounds of varnish.\n\nWhile the varnish distills, it exhales a malignant vapour, the bad effects of which can only be prevented by preservatives and great precaution. The merchant who employs the workmen is obliged to keep by him a large vase filled with rape-oil, in which a certain quantity of those fleecy filaments have been boiled that are found in hog's lard, and which do not melt. When the workmen are going to fix the shells to the trees, they carry some of this oil along with them, and rub their face and hands with it, which they do with greater care when they collect in the morning the varnish that has distilled during night. After eating, they wash their whole bodies with warm water, in which the bark of the chestnut tree, fir wood, crystallized saltpetre, and some other drugs, have been boiled. When they are at work near the trees, they put upon their heads a small cloth bag in which there are two holes, and cover the fore part of their bodies with a kind of apron made of doe skin, which is suspended from their necks with strings, and tied round them with a girdle. They also wear boots, and have coverings on their arms, made of the same kind of skin. The labourer who should attempt to collect varnish without using this precaution, would soon be punished for his rashness, and the most dreadful effects would ensue. The disorder shows itself by tettering, which become of a bright red colour, and spread in a very short time; the body afterwards swells, and the skin bursts and appears covered with an universal leprosy. The unhappy wretch could not long endure the excruciating pain which he feels, did he not find a speedy remedy in those preservatives which are used against the malignant and noxious exhalations of the varnish.\n\nThe season of collecting varnish being ended, the merchant puts it into small casks closely stopped. A pound of it newly made costs him about one shilling and eight pence Sterling; but he gains cent. per cent. upon it, and sometimes more, according to the distance of the place to which he transports it.\n\nBesides the lustre and beauty which that varnish gives to many of the Chinese manufactures, it has also the property of preserving the wood upon which it is laid, especially if no other matter be mixed with it. It prevents it from being hurt either by dampness or worms.\n\nEvery workman has a particular art and method of using the varnish. This work requires not only much skill and dexterity, but also great attention, to observe the proper degree of fluidity which the gum ought to have, as it must be neither too thick nor too liquid when it is laid on. Patience above all is necessary in those who wish to succeed. To be properly varnished, a work must be done at leisure; and the whole summer is scarcely sufficient to bring it to perfection. It is therefore rare to see any of those cabinets which are imported to us from Canton so beautiful and durable as those manufactured in Japan, Tong-king, and Nang-king, the capital of the province of Kiang-nan: not that the artists do not employ the same varnish; but as they work for Europeans, who are more easily pleased, they do not take the trouble of giving the pieces which come from their hands all the polish they are capable of receiving.\n\nThere are two methods of laying on the varnish; the simplest is, when it is immediately laid on the wood. The work is first polished, and then daubed over with a kind of oil which the Chinese call tong-yew. When this oil is dry, it receives two or three coats of varnish; which remain so transparent, that all the shades and veins of the wood may be seen through them. If the artist is desirous of entirely concealing the substance on which they are laid, nothing is necessary but to add a few more coats; these give the work a shining surface, the smoothness of which equals that of the most beautiful ice. When the work is dry, various figures are painted upon it in gold and silver, such as flowers, birds, trees, temples, dragons, &c. A new coat of varnish is then sometimes laid over these figures, which preserves them, and adds much to their splendor. The second method requires more preparation. The Chinese workmen fix to the wood by means of glue a kind of pasteboard, composed of paper, hemp, lime, and other ingredients, well beaten, that the varnish may incorporate with them. Of this they make a ground perfectly smooth and solid, over which the varnish is laid in thin coats, that are left to dry one after the other.\n\nIt often happens, that the lustre of varnished tables and other pieces of furniture is infallibly destroyed by tea and warm liquors. \"The secret of restoring to varnish its shining black colour (says a Chinese author) is to expose it for one night to a white hoar-frost, or to cover it some time with snow.\" For a method of imitating Chinese varnish, see Tuning.\n\nVarnish also signifies a sort of shining coat, wherewith potters-ware, delft-ware, china-ware, &c., are cov-","sp":145,"ep":147},{"h":"VARNISH","t":"which gives them a smoothness and lustre.

But this may be discovered by its softness; it being softer than the natural varnish, which is as hard as the metal itself.\n\nSome deposit their spurious metals in the earth for a considerable time, by which means they contract a sort of varnish, which may impose upon the less knowing; others use false ammonia, and others burnt paper.","sp":147,"ep":148},{"h":"VARRO","t":"MARCUS TERENTIUS, the most learned of all the Romans, was born 28 years B.C. He was a senator of the first distinction, both for birth and merit; and bore many great offices. He was an intimate friend of Cicero; and this friendship was confirmed and immortalized by a mutual dedication of their learned works to each other. Thus Cicero dedicated his Academic Questions to Varro; and Varro dedicated his treatise on the Latin tongue to Cicero. In the civil wars he was zealously attached to Pompey; but after his defeat soon submitted to Caesar, who was reconciled to him. Afterwards he applied his whole time to letters, and had the charge of the Greek and Latin libraries at Rome. He was above 70 when Antony proscribed him; however, he found means to escape and save his life, though he could not save some of his works and his library from being plundered by the soldiers. After this storm was over, he pursued his studies as usual; and Pliny relates, that he continued to study and to write when he was 88 years of age. He was 80 when he wrote his three books De re Rustica, which are still extant. Five of his books De lingua Latina, which he addressed to Cicero, are all extant. There remain, too, divers fragments of his works, particularly of his Menippean Satires, which are medleys of prose and verse; and Scaliger has collected some of his epigrams from among the Catalepta Virgili. His books De lingua Latina, and De re Rustica, were printed with the notes of Joseph Scaliger, Turnebus, and Victorius, by Henry Stephens at Paris, 1573, in 8vo, and have been published separately since among the Autores de lingua Latina, and the Autores de re Rustica.\n\nThere was another Varro of antiquity, called Atacinus, who was born about 10 years after the first, at a small town near Narbonne. Though infinitely below the Roman in learning, he was at least as good, if not a better, poet; which perhaps has made Lillius Gyraldus and other critics confound them. He composed many works in verse; some fragments of which were collected, and published with those of other ancient poets, at Lyons in 1603. His chief works were, A poem on the war with the Sequani, a people of Gaul; and the Astronomics, that went under the name of Planciades the grammarian. But the Argonautics, in four books, was what gained him the greatest reputation: and though indeed nothing but a translation of Apollonius Rhodius, yet was so well done as to be commended by Quintilian.","sp":148,"ep":148},{"h":"VARRONIA","t":"a genus of plants belonging to the clafs pentandria, and arranged in the natural system under the 4th order, Alperifoliace.

However, their opposition was unsuccessful; for the purity and simplicity of that religion which these good men taught, the spotless innocence that shone forth in their lives and actions, and the noble contempt of riches and honours which was conspicuous in the whole of their conduct and conversation, appeared so engaging to all such as had any sense of true piety, that the number of their followers daily increased.\u2014They accordingly formed religious assemblies, first in France, and afterwards in Lombardy, from whence they propagated their sect throughout the other provinces of Europe with incredible rapidity, and with such invincible fortitude, that neither fire, nor sword, nor the most cruel inventions of merciless persecution, could damp their zeal, or entirely ruin their cause.","sp":148,"ep":149},{"h":"VAULT","t":"in Architecture, an arched roof, so contrived that the stones which form it sustain each other.\n\nVaults are on many occasions to be preferred to sloping or flat ceilings, as they give a greater height and elevation, and are besides more firm and durable.\n\nVAYER.

He was the son of Felix de Vega and Francisca Fernandez, who were both descended from honourable families, and lived in the neighbourhood of Madrid. Our poet was born in that city on the 25th of November 1562. He was, according to his own expression, a poet from his cradle; and beginning to make verses before he had learned to write, he used to bribe his elder school-fellows with part of his breakfast, to commit to paper the lines he had composed. Having lost his father while he was yet still a child, he engaged in a frolic very natural to a lively boy, and wandered with another lad to various parts of Spain, till, having spent their money, and being conducted before a magistrate at Segovia for offering to sell a few trinkets, they were sent home again to Madrid. Soon after this adventure, our young poet was taken under the protection of Geronimo Manrique, bishop of Avila, and began to distinguish himself by his dramatic compositions, which were received with great applause by the public, though their author had not yet completed his education: for, after this period, he became a member of the university of Alcala, where he devoted himself for four years to the study of philosophy. He was then engaged as secretary to the duke of Alva, and wrote his Arcadia in compliment to that patron: who is frequently mentioned in his occasional poems. He quitted that employment on his marriage with Isabel de Urbina, a lady (says his friend and biographer Perez de Montalvan) beautiful without artifice, and virtuous without affectation. His domestic happiness was soon interrupted by a painful incident:\u2014Having written some lively verses in ridicule of a person who had taken some injurious freedom with his character, he received a challenge in consequence of his wit; and happening, in the duel which ensued, to give his adversary a dangerous wound, he was obliged to fly from his family, and shelter himself in Valencia. He resided there a considerable time; but connubial affection recalled him to Madrid. His wife died in the year of his return. His affliction at this event led him to relinquish his favourite studies, and embark on board the Armada which was then preparing for the invasion of England. He had a brother who served in that fleet as a lieutenant; and being shot in an engagement with some Dutch vessels, his virtues were celebrated by our afflicted poet, whose heart was peculiarly alive to every generous affection. After the ill success of the Armada, the disconsolate Lopez de Vega returned to Madrid, and became secretary to the marquis of Malpica, to whom he has addressed a grateful sonnet. From the service of this patron he passed into the household of the count of Lemos, whom he celebrates as an inimitable poet. He was once more induced to quit his attendance on the great, for the more inviting comforts of a married life. His second choice was Juana de Guardio, of noble birth and singular beauty. By this lady he had two children, a son who died in his infancy, and a daughter named Feliciana, who survived her father. The death of his little boy is said to have hastened that of his wife, whom he had the misfortune to lose in about seven years after his marriage. Having now experienced the precariousness of all human enjoyments, he devoted himself to a religious life, and fulfilled all the duties of it with the most exemplary piety: still continuing to produce an astonishing variety of poetical compositions. His talents and virtues procured him many unlooked-for honours. Pope Urban VIII. sent him the crosiers of Malta, with the title of Doctor in Divinity, and appointed him to a place of profit in the Apostolic Chamber; favours for which he expressed his gratitude by dedicating his Corona Tragica (a long poem on the fate of Mary queen of Scots) to that liberal pontiff. In his 73rd year he felt the approaches of death, and prepared himself for it with the utmost composure and devotion. His last hours were attended by many of his intimate friends, and particularly his chief patron the duke of Sessa, whom he had made his executor; leaving him the care of his daughter Feliciana, and of his various manuscripts. The manner in which he took leave of those he loved was most tender and affecting. He said to his disciple and biographer Montalvan, That true fame consisted in being good: and that he would willingly exchange all the applause he had received to add a single deed of virtue to the actions of his life. Having given his dying benediction to his daughter, and performed the last ceremonies of his religion, he expired on the 25th of August 1635.\n\nVEGETABLE PHYSIOLOGY.\u2014Under the article BOTANY, and also under PLANT, we have already delivered some of the commonly received doctrines on this subject. But as some late investigations seem to lead to new views with regard to the structure and nature of vegetables, we have thought it necessary to resume the subject, and to give as full a detail of the experiments and observations to which we allude as our limits will permit: we shall first treat of the structure, and secondly of the physiology of plants.\n\nI. STRUCTURE OF PLANTS.\u2014In considering the structure or anatomy of plants, we shall treat, 1st, of the root; 2d, of the stem and branches; 3d, of the leaves; and 4th, of the flowers; in the order in which they are now enumerated.\n\n1. The Root.\u2014The root is that organ belonging to vegetables by which they are supplied with nourishment, and by which they are fixed to a commodious situation. It was formerly supposed to be composed of outer and inner bark, of wood and of pith; but Mrs Ibbetson, who has lately communicated* to the public the results of an elaborate\nVegetable elaborate series of experiments on this subject, thinks\nPhyliology, that it is wholly composed of the rind much thickened,\nwith perhaps a very little of the outer bark, but no inner\nbark; of a quantity of wood, hardly any pith, and no\nspiral vessels. Mrs Ibbetson searched in vain for the\nlarger vessels of the inner bark, till it occurred to her that\nthe want of this bark accounted for there being no\nleaves on the root. Mrs Ibbetson had often been as-\nsured that roots were found bearing leaves, but on dis-\nsection of these supposed roots, she found that they were\nbranches which crossed the root.\n\nThe root consists of the caudex, stock or main body,\nand of the radicule or fibres which arise from the cau-\ndex, and are the organs by which the moisture is imme-\ndiately imbibed.\n\nIn botanical terminology, we generally consider all\nthat part of a plant which is under ground as the root;\nbut Linn\u00e9 comprehends under his definition, what we\nterm the body or trunk of the plant; and he went so\nfar as to call the stems of trees \"roots above ground\";\nbut as Dr Smith justly remarks, this seems paradoxical\nand scarcely correct. Dr Smith adds, that perhaps it\nwould be more accurate to call the caudex a subterra-\nneous stem; although he is rather inclined to think that\nit has functions distinct from the stem, analogous to di-\ngestion; for there is evidently a great difference in many\ncases, between the fluids of the root, at least the secre-\nted ones, and those of the rest of the plant.\n\nIn botanical physiology, by the term root, is often un-\nderstood the parts only which serve to keep the plants\nfirm in the ground; thus the bulbous and fleshy roots\nas they are called, are strictly speaking, not roots; the\nradicules or fibres being the real roots. The duration\nof roots is various; they are either annual, biennial, or\nperennial.\n\n2. The Stems and Branches.\u2014Linn\u00e9 long ago divided\nthe stems of trees into four parts; the rind, the bark,\nthe wood, and the pith; and nearly a similar division has\nbeen adopted by most vegetable physiologists till the\npresent time.\n\nMrs Ibbetson (aided by a powerful solar microscope),\nhowever, thinks that nature points out a more regular\ndivision, a division marked not only by the form, but\nby the difference of the juices, with which the parts are\nswelled.\n\nMrs Ibbetson divides the stem of trees into six parts:\n1. The rind; 2. The bark and inner bark; 3. The\nwood; 4. The spiral nerves; 5. The nerves or circle of\nlife (corona of Hill); and 6. The pith.\n\n1. Of the rind.\u2014Mrs Ibbetson conceives the rind to\nbe merely an outward covering to the tree, which pre-\nvents its juices from being evaporated by the influence\nof the sun's heat. The rind is continued under ground;\nbut it may be as useful there to prevent the entrance of\nthe dust and earth, the pressure of stones, or the injury\nof insects.\n\nThe rind is composed of two rows of cylinders, with a\nsingle line to divide them. The cylinders are filled\nwith a gelatinous liquor. There are seldom more than\nfour or five layers of vessels in the rind; but it is in ge-\nneral so covered with parasitic plants, as powdery li-\nchens, &c., that its thickness is often more than dou-\nbled.\n\nThe rind does not appear to be necessary to plants in\ngeneral, as there are many in which the bark serves\nas a covering in its stead; but it seems to form an essen-\ntial part of trees.\n\n2. Of the bark and inner bark.\u2014These parts, though\ncertainly different as to form, contain the same kind of\njuice; and being so nearly allied, may be treated of as\none. From the bark and inner bark the leaves take\ntheir origin, as will be shown when we come to treat of\nthe formation of the leaf-bud. Mrs Ibbetson conceives\nthat the juice of the bark is the blood of the tree.\n\nIn the bark alone are produced the gums, the resins,\nthe oil, the milk, &c.; in short all that belongs to the\ntree; gives taste to it; all that makes one plant differ\nfrom another, and all its virtues, if the expression may\nbe used. The bark is generally green; the inner bark\nwhite, yellow, or green. The former consists of vessels\ncrossing each other; the latter of bundles of vessels of\ntwo sizes. The large vessels consist of broad cylinders,\nhaving a bottom with a hole in it, through which the\nliquid passes, though not with perfect ease.\n\nMrs Ibbetson says that on exposing several pieces of\nthe inner bark to the solar microscope, the moment the\nlight fell on the specimen, the juice, which had before proceeded up the pipes rather slowly, was sud-\ndenly propelled forward with a force truly astonishing.\n\nWhen the heat and light were increased by causing\nthe focus of the rays to fall on the vessels, the side divi-\nsions of the vessels were broken through, thus inundat-\ning the specimen; but when a proper degree of light\nand heat was kept up, it was curious to observe the liq-\nuid passing from pipe to pipe, in one regular and easy\nflow, making only a short stop as it filtered through the\nstraitened apertures at the bottom of the vessels. Mrs\nIbbetson has often stood for more than an hour watch-\ning the current, (which passes, however, much slower\nthan the sap does), nor could she perceive while the\nheat and light were on it, that it required any addi-\ntional expedient to hasten its momentum; but during\nthe cold and darkness of night, she supposes that the\npressure of the bastard grain mentioned by Mr Knight,\nmay very likely assist its flow, as it is at night that the\nbastard grain is pressed against the cylinders.\n\nThe bastard grain is found however only in the wood;\nbut the contraction at the bottom of the large vessels of\nthe inner bark, may probably serve the same purpose,\nthe impetus of the current being increased by the lessening of the apertures of the vessels.\n\nThe vessels of the inner bark are very thick in pro-\nportion to their size, and there is placed in them a pec-\nuliar circular body, which resembles a cullender full of\nholes too small that no liquid could pass through. In\nviewing the thick juice which runs through these pipes, Mrs\nIbbetson observed many bubbles of air, the size of which\nwas increased or diminished according to the tempera-\nture; and as their size varied, so was the flow of the\nliquid accelerated or retarded. To see these vessels\nwell, the specimens may be placed in a basket which is\nto be fastened in a running stream for some time, or\nboiled thoroughly, and then thrown into green wax per-\nfectly melted.\n\nMirel says that \"some plants have the same juices\nin every part of them:\" but Mrs Ibbetson does not coin-\ncide with his idea, for she did not find it to be so; though\nthe potent smell of the liquid belonging to the bark\noften extends to other parts of the plant, yet it gener-\nally vanishes if kept separate for a day, or becomes so\nVegetable faint in comparison with the real liquid of the bark as to prove that it does not form an ingredient of these parts. Mirbel says that the cylinders of the inner bark are merely vacancies of the ordinary vessels; but Mrs Ibbetson states that they are exactly the same as these vessels, and occupy the same place.\n\nThey have a peculiar shape, being unlike any other vessels of the tree, and they perform a particular office.\n\nThe vessels of the bark are smaller, and more simple than those of the inner bark, and are divided by a line or two, running longitudinally between them.\n\n3. Of the Wood.\u2014This is a very obvious part. Place the item of any plant in a coloured liquid, and every vessel which conveys the sap from the earth to the top of the tree will be tinged.\n\nThe sap is a thin watery liquor, probably medicated from the earth, in order to become suitable for the life of vegetables.\n\nMrs Ibbetson supposes that the sap may vary with the soil, though on trial she has never found that change which might have been suspected.\n\nIf we make a transverse section of the stem of a tree, two different kinds of layers present themselves in the wood; some running in a circular manner, which timber merchants call the silver grain; and others from the circumference to the centre, which they denominate the bastard grain. Linne long ago believed that one of the circular layers was added to the tree each year. This opinion has often been controverted, and among others by Duhamel and Mirbel; but Mrs Ibbetson has had an opportunity of verifying the accuracy of Linne's opinion. She also observed that the layer was large or small according to the exposure of the tree, and the favourableness of the season: thus in exposed situations, the circles taken as a whole, were much narrower than in trees not exposed. In some trees she noticed only half of a circular layer.\n\nMrs Ibbetson thinks the bastard stripe consists of two lines or strings, with a little scale between them; and they appear from their extreme susceptibility to be formed of the same leather-like substance as the spiral vessels, which we are immediately to notice.\n\nMr Knight merely calls them scales; but as he mentions their pressing close (which they certainly do) to the cylinders at night, and during cold weather, it is obvious (whichever of the opinions we adopt) that the bastard grains are capable of supplying the place of the sun's rays, by their pressure.\n\nThe wood-vessels are far more simple in structure than those of the bark; they are very narrow cylinders, and the two rows next to the corona are covered by the spiral vessels.\n\nIt is indeed difficult to determine the exact extent of the spiral vessels even with the assistance of the solar microscope, for it is by unwinding them alone that they can be known; and their extreme fineness confuses, in consequence of which they have been taken for sap vessels. Neither Mr Knight nor Mirbel was led into this mistake, and Mrs Ibbetson thinks that there can be no doubt that these vessels (formerly so called) are solid strings which hold no liquid.\n\nThe vessels of the wood may be best seen in slices of the stems of young trees; and if not very visible when recently cut, they will soon become so if the slices are kept in a dry place.\n\nIf the wood-vessels are cut longitudinally and observed with a high magnifier, as soon as the light is permitted to come on the glass, the flow of sap will be accelerated, and with perfect ease will run up vessels so diminutive that to measure them is almost impossible.\n\nA few of the wood-vessels are separated and run with the spiral vessels to each leaf, in order to nourish it, as will be more particularly noticed when we come to treat of the leaf-bud.\n\nBut little of the sap, however, passes off in this way from the principal current, which flows on; its chief purpose being to form the stamen and the pollen appertaining to it, and afterwards to lend its principal aid to the formation of the fruit and seed.\n\n4. The spiral vessels are a quantity of solid strings coiled up into a spiral form. Mrs Ibbetson supposes them to be formed of a leather-like substance, and, as already mentioned, to be rolled round the wood. In this spiral manner they run up the stems of trees and plants of every kind, (with a few exceptions) and from thence into every leaf and flower. These spiral cords are finly too small to be observed by the naked eye. They run into every fibre of the leaf, and are fastened to its edges, thus croiling among the vessels in every direction like a spider's web; by which disposition they can draw the leaves in any way that is necessary for them.\n\nThe larger of the interior wood-vessels are each supplied with sets of ten or twelve spiral cords, but the smaller of these have only three or four to each.\n\nIn the cabbage leaf and in the burdock, the spiral cords may be found in bundles almost as thick as a packthread, but in smaller leaves they are properly proportioned. These spiral cords, Mrs Ibbetson thinks, are the cause of the motions of plants. See Plant, p. 601, where these cords are called air-vessels.\n\n5. Of the corona or circle of life.\u2014The next part to be noticed is the small circle of vessels situated between the wood and the pith, the importance of which, in the formation of the seed, will be noticed under Impregnation of the Seed; where are also related strong proofs to show that a plant cannot exist a day without the corona, and that if a young plant be deprived of this part, it will not grow again, though it will certainly do so if the plant be somewhat old. It is very curious that almost every botanical anatomist should have figured this part, without giving it a name, or noticing it particularly; and that these anatomists should have attributed all its powers to the pith, which, from the short term of its existence, and its being perpetually impeded in its progress to make way for the flower-bud, can evidently have but little influence. The circle of life, however, has not escaped the notice of Hill, who termed it the corona.\n\nThe circle of life consists of rows of little cylinders which have their own peculiar juice, generally of an astringent quality. From the corona all branches take their rise, and from it all wood threads grow. The cylinders of which it is composed run up into all flower-buds, but never approach the leaf-bud as is represented by fig. 1 and 2.; when these cylinders enter the flower-bud, they make their way distinctly to each separate flower.\nVegetable flower, forming the pistil, and after depositing in each physiology, vide the line, which is the first origin of life, they are afterwards impregnated, or acquire the power of giving life by the juice of the stamen, which runs through the same string into the seed.\n\nThat the principal vitality of the plant resides in the corona, we think is proved by the experiments and observations of Mrs Ibbetson under Impregnation of Seed, and seems to be farther confirmed by the following remarks.\n\nWhen a branch is cut from a tree, or a tree is torn up, the corona or circle of life is the first part that dies; and if, after a sudden frost, we examine the flowers of a fruit tree, we shall find that neither the calyx, the corolla, the filaments, nor the seeds are hurt, but that the pistils are destroyed. And if we now observe the pistils with care, we shall see that it is the line of life which is decayed, and that this is the first part in which mortification commences. The peculiar liquor of the pistil acquires a blood-red colour, and the vessels which run up to the stigma become black, instead of their natural yellow colour.\n\nIf in wood, this line is injured (either by the decay of the bark or other means) the circle will undulate into a thousand forms, for the purpose of regaining a healthy situation in which it may pursue its course.\n\nMrs Ibbetson, to prove the power of the circle of life, relates the following observations respecting the pod reptans.\n\nShe had often measured in winter, seven or eight yards of this grass, which appeared perfectly dead; and yet in May or June, she perceived life in it at the most distant end from the stalk. Next spring she took up two of these creeping branches which were much alike; and on dissecting one of them through its whole length, she found in it a collection of little vessels not thicker than a very fine thread.\n\nThis collection of vessels had run about half way the length of the branch, which was about three yards.\n\nMrs Ibbetson having merely opened the cover of the grass, laid it down again, and the little vessels continued increasing till they reached the end of the branch, when they made a stop, and it was perceived that the grass began to thicken; and at the end nearest the roots, the dead part became inflated with juice, lost by degrees its dead appearance, thickened about the joints within, and at last shot forth fresh leaves and fresh roots from every joint.\n\nMrs Ibbetson has since watched with the greatest care, and found that the fine thread which runs through the grass protected by the dead scale, was the circle of life. When this thread is stopped by the covers decaying, it waits till the season permits the rest of the plant to grow. From what has been said, it is evident that the dead matter may be inflated with a living juice, and live itself again, provided the life near the stem of the plant be not extinguished. Mrs Ibbetson has observed this to happen in many plants, as in hydrangea, in which the stalks apparently lie down and are inflated again, or at least a part of them.\n\n6. Pith.\u2014Linnaeus considered the pith of plants as of equal importance with the spinal marrow of animals; but Mrs Ibbetson thinks this part of but little consequence, and transfers this importance to the circle of life, which she compares to the brain and spinal marrow. She conceives that the pith forms merely a source of moisture for the plant when required. The pith flops with every flower-bud, and begins again to grow as soon as the bud is past; it decreases as the strength and size of the tree increase; it is the only part of the tree which is devoid of vessels; it is merely a net, not a bundle of cylinders, and is commonly of a remarkably splendid or silver white colour.\n\nIt has been said that the pith affumes a variety of figures, but Mrs Ibbetson thinks this is a mistake, though she admits a few different sorts.\n\nAll young trees and shrubs are provided with pith; but in the progress of their growth they need it no longer, the wood being a good substitute. On the same account, in general, we find no pith in water plants, which have a hollow stem, and rarely suffer from drought.\n\nLinnaeus thought that the pith was the seat of life and the source of vegetation; or in a word, the primary part of the plant. Duhamel considered it as of but little importance at all. Wildenow and Knight concur with Mrs Ibbetson in regarding it as a reservoir of moisture for the young plants; and Dr Smith holds a medium opinion between that of Linnaeus and the other authors just named.\n\nHe says \"there is in certain respects an analogy between the medulla of plants, and the nervous system of animals; it is no less affluently protected than the spinal marrow; it is branched off and diffused through the plant, as nerves through the animal. Hence it is not absurd to presume that it may in like manner give life and vigour to the whole, though by no means, any more than nerves, the organ or source of nourishment.\"\n\nWe were somewhat surprised to find that Mrs Ibbetson had not particularly noticed the cellular tissue as a distinct part to be seen in the stems of trees, as it has been long known; we shall therefore subjoin a description of it. It is a succulent cellular substance, generally of a green colour, at least in the leaves and branches. Duhamel long ago called it enveloppe cellulaire, and Mirbel more lately, tissu herbeux.\n\nDuhamel supposed that the cellular tissue formed the cuticle, or epidermis; but this is not very probable, as his own experiments show that when the cuticle is removed, the cellular integument exfoliates, at least in trees, or is thrown off in consequence of the injury, and a new cuticle, covering a new layer of the cellular tissue, is formed under the old one. This substance is very universal, even in mosses and ferns. Leaves consist almost entirely of a plate of this substance, covered on each side by the cuticle. The stems and branches both of annual and perennial plants are invested with it; but in woody plants it is dried up, and reproduced almost continually, such parts only having that reproductive power. The old layers remain, are pushed outward by the new ones, and form at length the rugged dry dead covering of the old trunks of trees. The cellular integument is a part of plants of the greatest importance; for in it the juices of plants are operated on by light, air, &c.\n\nWith regard to the branches of trees, it has been already noticed, that they derive their origin from the corona; and they are composed exactly of the same parts as the trunks from which they arise.\n\n3. The Leaves.\u2014Mrs Ibbetson has, with the assistance\nVegetable ances of the solar microscope, and by great attention to this natural process, been enabled to give some new and interesting views on this subject. Her opinion respecting the formation of the leaf-bud is, \"That leaves are formed or woven by the vessels or cotton that is generally supposed by botanists (to be) placed there to defend the bud from the severities of winter; that these vessels (or cotton) are a continuation of those of the bark and inner bark in the stem of the plant; that these vessels compose the various interlacing branches of the leaf, which are soon filled up by the concentrated and thickened juices of the inner bark, which form the pabulum of the leaf.\"\n\nMrs Ibbetson says the truth of her assertion may be easily seen by dissecting early buds, in which, except two or three, nothing but the cotton-like vessels will be found. She asks then what could be the use of these vessels? and answers, that to put them within the bud to keep the outside warm is against nature, for it is contrary to nature. The leaf-bud in its first state consists of two or three scales, including a parcel of vessels, which appear like very moist coarse cotton, but when drawn out and placed in the solar microscope, they show themselves to be merely the vessels of the bark and inner bark elongated and curled up in various forms.\n\nThese vessels are of three kinds like the bark, &c. First, three or four short thick ones which appear to grow from the larger vessels of the inner bark, and through which the thickened juice flows, but with this difference, that the holes are not there.\n\nThen there are two smaller-sized vessels, which exactly resemble the smaller vessels of the bark.\n\nMrs Ibbetson has always found the short thick kind of vessels to form the mid-rib of the leaves, and the smaller-sized vessels to compose the interlacing fibres (or vessels) of the other parts of the leaves; and from often comparing the full grown leaf with the leaf of the bud, she feels the most thorough conviction that the latter takes its origin as above noticed. The pabulum of the leaf which lies between the vessels, is composed of that thick juice which runs in the bark or inner bark of the tree, and which does not exist in any other part of it. The pabulum differs essentially from the sap, and may be called the blood of the tree, as it possesses peculiar properties in different trees; thus it is of a gummy nature in one, of a resinous in a second, and of an oily nature in a third, &c.\n\nMrs Ibbetson is not certain whether the pabulum both flows forwards and in a retrograde direction; but she is convinced that the greatest part of it is taken up in forming the leaves. The pabulum of the leaf, after the vessels are arranged and crooked, grows over in bladders, making alternate layers with the smaller pipes (vessels), and with the branches of the leaf.\n\nMrs Ibbetson states, that she does not know any tree which gives a more convincing proof of the formation of the leaves in the bud, than may be seen in the horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum) about the month of November or December.\n\nSeveral different mid-ribs may be taken out at once from the same leaf-bud, which have an innumerable number of extremely fine filken vessels fastened to or growing up from each side of them. When these vessels have become sufficiently interlaced with each other, the pabulum will begin to grow over them, in form of Vegetable small bladders full of a watery-juice; and then larger vessels will cross over them, which will soon be followed by another row of bladders, and a similar process will go on until the leaf has attained its proper thicknesses. The leaves thus formed are very small, but when once their shape is completed every part of them continues to increase in size. Fig. 6 represents the leaf-bud of the horse-chestnut, as it was examined by Mrs Ibbetson about the month of January.\n\nMrs Ibbetson next notices the arrangement of the leaves in the buds of different trees; but we shall consider them by and bye.\n\nThe rolling, folding, or plaiting, &c., of the leaf-bud, it is observed, does not merely take place at once; but to complete the process of budding, it appears that this arrangement of the leaves is repeated several times. During this arrangement the bud-leaves are immersed in the glutinous liquor which runs in the bark (and forms the pabulum); and the pressure of the leaves is very great. By this pressure and the rolling, &c., the leaves are completed; so if a leaf be taken from the bud before this process commences, it may be compared to a piece of cloth before it is dressed; for its back will be obscured by the ends of vessels, which, had it remained in situ, would have been all rubbed off, except the hairs which remain on many plants.\n\nWe come now to the formation of the edge of the leaf, a curious and beautiful process.\n\nThe bud if opened will appear full of the glutinous liquor which forms the pabulum, and the leaves arranged in the manner proper to the particular tree from which the bud is taken. If one of the leaves be taken out, the edges (in whatever manner folded) will exhibit a perfect double row of bubbles, following the fold of the edge of the leaf; and it will appear as if it were let with brilliants.\n\nThings being in this state, all that is wanting for the completion of the leaf is the formation of the pores, now to be mentioned. Mrs Ibbetson states that in many hundred forming leaves which she exposed to the solar microscope, she had never once been able to see the pores; which she has often observed after the leaves have completely quitted the bud; and she is uncertain whether this is owing to the greater thickness of the young leaf, and its being covered with more hairs than it is afterwards, which obscure or conceal the pores; or whether it be caused by the upper net-work of the leaf growing last. While the upper and under cuticles of the leaf are growing, the edge of it is completing; for the bubbles generally divide, and partly dry up, leaving horny points in their stead. When the edges of the leaves are completely formed, they burst from the bud and assume a different aspect.\n\nThe vessels of the leaves (those confined within the mid ribs and side ribs of the leaves) are of two sorts, the spiral, and the nourishing. The spiral vessels are those cork-thread-like wires which surround the two last rows of the sap vessels. The nourishing vessels are the only parts formed of the wood. They convey the sap necessary for the support of the leaves, and run on each side of the spiral vessels.\n\nTo prove that she has given a fair and accurate account of the formation of the leaf, Mrs Ibbet-\nVegetable form adds the following remarks. The colour of leaves, the observer, is not to be found in their substance, but in the liquid with which it is filled. The darkest green leaf that can be procured, has both its upper and under cuticles of a perfect white colour. In the cuticle the pores are to be found.\n\nA leaf has rather a thicker net below than it has above; but this does not sufficiently account for the varieties of tints in different leaves.\n\nThe under net (or cuticle) does not lie so close to the pabulum of the leaf as the upper one; which may account for the colour not piercing so much through. When the two nets (or cuticles) are taken off, then the pabulum of the leaf appears.\n\nThe pabulum is formed of little bladders, filled with a dark-green liquid, and interlaced with vessels. When the pabulum is removed, a bed of large vessels presents itself; then a collection of bladders; which is followed by the larger lines (or veins) of the leaf. We next meet with another bed of bladders, which is covered by the under cuticle. Though the bladders differ in size and colour as well as in thickness in different leaves, yet the general arrangement is the same in most plants; but there are exceptions, as the firs, grasses, or those grassy leaves of early spring, which we have in the iris, crocus, snow-drop, &c., for their leaves are of a different nature.\n\nBut we shall now refer to the figures, which will serve to illustrate the mode of formation, &c., of the leaf-bud.\n\nFig. 7. 8. 9. Fig. 7, 8, 9, exhibit the commencement of the formation and growth of leaves; \\(a, a, a, a\\), the mid rib; \\(b, b, b\\), the young vessels appearing like cotton; \\(c, c\\), the spiral nerves; \\(d\\), the smaller vessels crossing each other.\n\nFig. 10. shews the formation of the pabulum; \\(e, e\\), the fine vessels growing up each side of the mid rib; \\(f\\), the pabulum.\n\nFig. 11. bud of the lime-tree (tilia Europaea).\n\n4. Of the Flowers, including the calyx, corolla, stamina, and pistillum.\u2014Linnaeus long ago expressed his opinion that each of these parts was formed from a particular part of the stem; thus the calyx was formed by the bark, the corolla by the inner bark, the stamina by the wood, and the pistillum by the pith. Linnaeus also reckoned the pith of a plant (which he considered to be of equal importance with the spinal marrow of animals), as the sole formative organ of the whole vegetable kingdom.\n\nLinnaeus's idea respecting the formation of the calyx, corolla, &c., has been often refuted; but Mrs Ibbetson comes forward to defend the opinion of the illustrious author with a little modification. She does not, as already noticed, consider the pith as of great importance; she therefore says, that the corona or circle of life forms the pistil, not the pith; and thinks that each part of the stem has, when it arrives near the flower stalk, its peculiar juice.\n\nMrs Ibbetson, as a strong proof that the circle of life forms the pistil, says that it is to be found in all these leaves that bear the flower either on the middle or on their side; but in no other leaves.\n\nShe first observed this in the butcher's broom, where this circle leads directly up to the flower; then in scopulopendrums, and afterwards in xylophyllus.\n\nThe leaves of such plants are more woody than any Vegetable others, as every one may know on breaking them. In Phylogeny, such plants also, the circle of life may be traced as leading from one flower to another.\n\nMrs Ibbetson also thinks that all those parts which concur in forming the flower also join in forming the fruit and seed.\n\nMrs Ibbetson then adverts to the opinion of Wildenow, when he says, \"we find in the springing flower, elongations of air-vessels, but we never see the elongations from each particular part, one forming the future calyx, another the corolla, and so forth.\" For instance, in the common sunflower (Helianthus annuus), where in an immense large receptacle, numerous small flowers are placed, how should these elongations be able to unfold themselves into florets from the bark, inner bark, &c., through such a receptacle? There would arise a confusion amongst these small parts which is never met with.\"\n\n\"How should, besides, the stamina be formed in herbs, which are not ligneous, or the pistil in plants which have no pith? Every one may thus easily conceive that all these opinions are mere hypotheses, which may be refuted, even without the aid of anatomical dissection.\"\n\nMrs Ibbetson attacks Wildenow's opinion, and says that he adduces the fyngenean clasps to prove the accuracy of it, the clasps which contains the very plants that would have proved the mistake of his argument, had he dissected them.\n\nMrs Ibbetson then proposes the following questions to Wildenow. Why, if the nourishment of each part of the stem be not confined to each different part of the flower, does the whole arrangement of the parts alter, the moment it gets to the flower-stalk.\n\nWhy are there particular vessels to confine and carry the juice to each peculiar part, if it were not of consequence that this juice should touch no other places? For what purpose is the curious and artificial management in the bottom and top of a seed-vessel, which enables the dissector to say, that \"there are five divisions of little vessels proceeding from the wood; I know, therefore (though I do not see it), that this must be a pentandrian flower; here is but one middle vessel proceeding from the circle of life (for the pith flows), it is therefore of the order monogynia; here are five divisions of little vessels proceeding from the inner bark, it must therefore have five petals?\" Mrs Ibbetson wishes others to be convinced of these facts as well as herself. If a cut be made above or below the seed-vessel of a lily, a violet, or a tulip, the thinker conviction of her accuracy will follow. Why in cutting above or below the seed-vessel of a fyngenean flower can you directly tell, whether it belong to the order superflua, aquilis, or segregata? Look at the bottom of the seed-vessel of the Sonchus; every pin-hole of the vessel of the male is carried up by corresponding vessels in the outward cuticle of the seed till it meets and joins the ligature of the males; and the female liquor is protruded through the inside of the seed, and is perhaps one of the strongest proofs of the impregnation of the female. In the fyngenean clasps (see fig. 12.), the delicacy of the vessels, which may be supposed too small for a liquid to flow through them, must not impede the belief that it does so, when we con-\nVegetable fider the circulation of blood in the diminutive animal Physiology that torments the body of the flea or louse. Mrs Ibbetson says she has seen the liquor run up with the utmost celerity through the upper cuticle of a very small seed of a plant belonging to the fyngeneian clas, till it met the male and continued its course. It is to be understood that the juice from the corolla flows in the rest of the cuticle, and that the largest vessels are those for the Fig. 12. 13. the male liquor. See fig. 12. 13.\n\nII. PHYSIOLOGY OF PLANTS.\u2014In treating this part of the subject, we propose to consider, first, the impregnation of seeds, and, second, the irritability of vegetables.\n\n1. The impregnation of the seed.\u2014The investigation of what is included under this title, forms one of the most beautiful and interesting pursuits of the vegetable physiologist. Mrs Ibbetson has communicated some curious observations on this subject. Provided with a powerful solar microscope for opaque objects, she proceeds to an examination of the seed, and the first shooting of the infant plant, or rather of the germ or vessel which precedes it; and she remarks that it is almost impossible to ascertain the exact time when the seed is first formed in the pericarp; but that she has always found it in the winter buds when they were large enough for dissection.\n\nIt is curious to observe the vessels, which, she says, may properly be called the life, tracing their way to each flower-bud; for a seed may be said to depend for perfection on two separate moments: the one in which the life first enters the seed, when the whole outward form appears to be perfected; and the second, when the impregnation of the seed takes place, by the ripening of the pollen.\n\nBut when the life enters, it leaves a little string, and remains for a long time afterwards in a torpid state. This string crosses the corculum, or heart of the seed, so called because it is the cradle of the infant plant. She then states that the seed is attached to the feed-vein by two distinct organs, termed by the first botanists the umbilical cord, but as she thinks improperly, since they do not convey nourishment to the infant plant, which is wholly the office of the second set of vessels. We cannot agree with Mrs Ibbetson in her opinion; for although the umbilical cord of an infant contains nourishing vessels, it also contains nerves, and yet we would never think of restricting this term alone to the arteries. The first of the connecting organs Mrs Ibbetson conceives to be the circle of life, first, because without it the plant dies, and, second, because although every other part be eradicated by degrees and the circle of life be uninjured, the plant will grow again.\n\nShe has made these experiments many thousand times and with the above results. The circle of life consists of delicate simple vessels, which carry a juice of a particular nature, and may be traced in every part lying between the wood and the pith. These vessels are not to be found in the leaf-bud; for they pass by it to the female flower, where they establish a new life in the feed: a life which will enable it to grow, but not to Vegetable give life without impregnation. These vessels are the Physiology, life, therefore, from which all flower-branches grow and all root-threads proceed. In calling these vessels the circle of life, Mrs Ibbetson says the only expression what its office seems to denote.\n\nMrs Ibbetson goes on to describe the next (or second) organ by which the seed is attached to the feed-vein. It consists of the nourishing vessels, which she is inclined to think proceed from the inner bark; at least they may certainly be traced thence after the infant plant has left the seed. When introduced, they enter not the seed at the same place as the life does; they come not into the corculum, but pass it, and spread themselves over a small spot below it, which is visibly of a different nature from the rest of the feed. In farinaceous plants this spot is yellow and yields a milk-white juice; but in other seeds it is white, and gives a glutinous water of a sweetish taste. Mrs Ibbetson thinks it probable that the nourishing vessels come from the fruit filled with this juice, which medicated with that part of the seed (which very apparently dissolves), they together form a nourishment suited to the infant plant. When the seed is far perfected, it remains in an almost torpid state, or growing very little; while the flower expands daily, and the stamens are hastily advancing to their perfect state.\n\nIt is now that by an almost imperceptible contraction of the lower part of the pistil, the juice is raised to the stigma (A) on which it may be seen hanging in a large glutinous drop, which never falls off. As soon, however, as the mid-day heat abates, this juice, which is peculiar to the pistil, retires again within the tube, the contraction ceasing with the heat that caused it. The same process goes on daily, till the stamens are ripe and ready to give out their interior powder to the pistil, which is always so placed as to receive the greater part of it; and as the anther (B) requires only moisture to burst it, it soon yields that fine and imperceptible dust, which quickly melting and mixing with the before-mentioned liquid, forms a combination of so powerful and stimulating a quality, that it no sooner runs down the interior of the style, and touches the nerve of life in the heart of the feed, than this vessel floats forth in the most surprising degree, forming directly a species of circular hook within the void; which in less than two days is often completely filled, though it had perhaps for many weeks before lain in an absolute torpor. This circular nerve is soon covered by an excrescence that hides it; but if the corculum be divided with a fine lancet, the circular hook is discoverable, until the young plant is near leaving its cradle or feed. At the turn of the hook, the cotyledons grow, and the root shoots from the covered end. The plant may be now said to lie in the feed in a contrary direction from that in which it will at a future time grow, since the root is above, and the stem below: but nature has provided for their change of place, since it is effected as they leave the feed. It has been already noticed that the nourishment of the infant plant\n\n(A) In the journal it is said \"to the pointal;\" but certainly stigma is meant, for pistil and pointal are synonymous.\n\n(B) In the journal it is called pollen, but anther must be meant.\nVegetable plant is medicated between the juice brought in the nourishing vessels, and the peculiar spot in the feed, forming a liquid which continues to abound; indeed the infant plant may be said to repose in it, till the root has opened the whole or part of the seed. The root then changes its direction, and runs into the earth, soon forming a number of stringy hairs, which serve as so many suckers to draw the liquid nourishment from the earth, while the plant quickly swells, by the rapid progress it makes, the advantage it receives from its change of diet; for it soon rises itself from its prostrate posture, emerges from the seed, and is now seen in its proper direction. The above account, we think Mrs Ibbetson justly remarks, affords a complete confirmation of the sexual system.\n\nIn the syngeneian orders, the pistil being mostly single, runs up from the seed; and the juice of the pistil has no other way of reaching the pointal (stigma must be here meant), but by passing through the seed, which it does without producing any effect, or filling up the vacancy at the top of the corculum. But as soon as the juice of the pistil becomes mixed with the pollen, which diffuses in it, the void of the corculum is filled, the hook is soon afterwards formed, and the plant is raised to life. Mrs Ibbetson relates some experiments which she made to ascertain whether the umbilical cord was, or was not, the life of the plant. She placed a bean in the earth, and when the infant plant was ready to leave the seed she opened it with a fine lancet, and cut off the cotyledons, just where they join the heart and the circular hook which have been before described. She then tied a piece of very fine thread round the bean, and replaced it in the earth. The cotyledons grew again, though higher up, but they appeared very weak and sickly for some time. She cut off the root of another bean which had been placed in the earth, and which was of the same age as the above, and found that the root grew again in a few days and appeared quite healthy.\n\nIn a third experiment she separated and cut off the nourishing vessels from each side of the bean; but a great number of hairs grew from the wounded part, which, by attaining moisture from the earth for nourishment, supplied the place of the vessels cut off; so that it was not ascertained whether or not the bean would live independent of these vessels, which was the object of the experiment. We observe here, however, a grand provision of nature for the embryo plant: hairs being formed to supply it with moisture when the nourishing vessels are destroyed. Mrs Ibbetson next took a bean which had been about four days in the earth, and opening it with great care took out with a fine lancet the part which she esteems the cord of life, that is the part which crosses the corculum and shot forth on the first impregnation of the plant. oo figs. 14. and 15. represent the nourishing vessels of a bean; L to n two seminal leaves or cotyledons; // the cord of life, which is more easily seen in the seed of the lily, fig. 15. // crossing the empty part of the corculum. Mrs Ibbetson took a flower of the lilium genus, as having a large vessel easily attained; and being careful not to separate it from the nourishing vessels, she divided the line of life fig. 16. //, cutting each thread between the seeds, and fo cutting off their communication; but did not touch oo, which she thinks is the nourishing vessel.\n\nThe consequence was, that the seeds of this flower were never impregnated. Mrs Ibbetson next tried the effect of taking the nerve of life from the chestnut, the walnut, acorn, &c.; first opening a seed without touching the nerve, that she might be certain that the opening was not the cause of its death. Fig. 17. represents the Fig. 17. heart taken out of a seed of the chestnut; / is the circular hook already described; oo the nourishing vessels, and // the line of life, which was taken out from some seeds where it crosses the heart at m. Fig. 18. is the Fig. 18. seed of the gooseberry; oo the nourishing vessels, e the line of life, and m the corculum or heart.\n\nShe found that all those seeds from which she took the nerve of life died; and that the others, which had been merely laid open, lived. She remarks that it is only at the beginning of life, that the plant can be killed by this process; for when older, if the nerves of life decay, they shoot out above the declining part, and run into any part of the stem that is pure, to preserve themselves. Mrs Ibbetson then states that this nerve is the source of life in very decayed trees; and is also the cause of a double pith, or at least the appearance of it, in many trees.\n\nTo observe this line of life, seeds must be examined in their first formation; for when it has done its office, it detaches itself. When the seed is boiled, the line of life and nourishing vessels mark themselves by becoming of a dark colour.\n\n2. Irritability of vegetables.\u2014In entering upon this subject, we ought to warn our readers, that very opposite opinions have been entertained respecting it; some physiologists of the greatest eminence allowing that we have satisfactory proofs of the irritability of vegetables in a variety of plants, but more particularly in the motions of the mimosa, dionea, &c.; while others of no less respectability ascribe these motions to the influence of light, heat, or some other mechanical agent.\n\nAs neither muscles nor nerves have ever been demonstrated in the vegetable structure, of course the proofs of the irritability of vegetables are drawn from the intimate analogy which seems to exist between the motions of some plants and those of animals. Some physiologists, from observing the similarity of motions in the two kingdoms, were naturally led to ascribe them to the same cause; others, from not being able to observe the same motive organs, namely, muscles, in both kingdoms, denied that plants could possess irritability; a third set, wavering the idea of irritability in the vegetable kingdom, have laboured to shew that the motions of plants depend on mechanical causes alone.\n\nWe shall first notice the observations of Mrs Ibbetson, who ascribes the motions of plants to the spiral wires which we have described. Her opinion is founded upon a number of new observations made with the solar microscope, which we shall proceed to relate.\n\n1st. The spiral vessels are not to be found in any plants to which motion is unnecessary.\n\nShe could not observe these vessels in any of the firs, in any of the plants which spread their leaves upon the surface of the water, in any of the sea weeds (c), of the lichens, or of the grasses; and she does not think\n\n(c) She afterwards excepts the conservae, which have motion.\nthat they exist in the fcolopendrums or leumas. We would here observe that if these observations were completely true, they would certainly afford a strong proof in confirmation of her opinion; but we suspect that they are not altogether just, especially as we observe a discrepancy in the papers of Mrs Ibbetson. Thus at one part she has given us a very minute description of the spiral vessels in the runners of the poa reptans, and now she says they are not to be found in the grases (d).\n\nMrs Ibbetson's second argument is, that if a plant whose leaves present their faces to the light, be turned so that the backs are to the sun, the leaves in a few hours will regain their former position; but if this be often repeated, although the plant will not suffer, yet the leaves will be longer at every repetition in returning to their former situation, or will cease to move at all. She accounts for this by saying, that the spiral-like elastic vessels are relaxed by the operation, and lose their power of coiling into their usual form.\n\nOthers would account for the above fact by saying that the irritability of the plant was exhausted by these repeated and unnatural actions; in the same manner as the mimosa becomes gradually less sensible to impressions when too often renewed.\n\nMrs Ibbetson's third argument is, that those leaves which have most motion, are provided with most spiral vessels, and have these vessels most twisted; as in the populus tremula.\n\nFourth proof. Mrs Ibbetson divided the spiral vessels of a vine leaf while growing, without touching the nourishing vessels; and from that moment it never contracted, and when placed with its back to the light, it did not alter its position, though it was long before it decayed. Both electricity and galvanism cause these leaves to contract, by affecting the spiral wires (not the cuticle), for when the leaf is deprived of these vessels it does not contract at all.\n\nWe would here remark that we suspect much, in the above experiment, that more than the spiral vessels was divided: at any rate there is very great discordance between Mrs Ibbetson's experiments and that of M. Candelierini, who found that vine leaves turned to the light when they were separated from the stem and suspended by a thread.\n\nFifth argument. Mrs Ibbetson observed, when she placed some of the spiral vessels taken from a cabbage leaf upon one end of a long netting needle, and caused a candle to approach, that they were much agitated, and at last flung themselves off the needle. We think no conclusion can be drawn from what is here stated.\n\nThe fresh water convolvulus and the dodder tribe, are the only plants, without leaves, that Mrs Ibbetson is acquainted with, which have spiral vessels.\n\nMrs Ibbetson says that the spiral vessels are so very tough, and so very tightly coiled, in the leaf stem (petiole) of the geranium cordifolium, that she has by means of them been enabled to draw up the leaf; but it is difficult to be done.\n\nThe sixth proof is drawn from the effect produced by moisture on Captain Kater's hygrometer, which will be noticed soon.\n\nGeneral Observations.\u2014Mrs Ibbetson says the spiral Vegetable wires may be considered as a secondary cause of motion, as they are primarily acted upon by light and moisture. By means of the spiral wire, all the movements of plants are made; by it, flowers open in the morning and shut in the evening; the leaves turn, and the creeping plants wind in their regular order. Mrs Ibbetson lays the opening of the flower at a different time of the day, or its turning in a different manner, does not militate against the above statement; as strong light and dry weather produce a contraction of the wire, while darkness and moisture effect a dilatation of it. It depends wholly upon the position in which the spiral wire is placed, whether by its dilatation the flowers shall be opened or shut, as in mechanics the same spring may be made to turn to the right or to the left, to open or to shut a box. Most of the flowers which Mrs Ibbetson has observed to close at noon, have an extremely slender corolla, formed only of a double cuticle without palatum; and hence they are soon overcome by heat, and relaxation directly takes place; as in the convolvulus nil, the evening or tree primrose, &c.\n\nWe must add, however, that we regard this account of the spiral vessels with some degree of doubt. We suspect that the spiral vessels, if they have the power of opening or shutting a flower, will always act in one uniform manner; i.e., if they are able to open it, they will always do so, and vice versa.\n\nThe nymphaea also raises itself out of the water, and expands, about seven o'clock in the morning; and closes again, reposeful upon the surface, about four in the evening. Now its petals are much thicker than those of the leontodon taraxacum, which floats up its flowers between eight and nine in the evening.\n\nWe could multiply instances; but we conceive we have said enough to shew, that the flowers with the most slender corolla are not uniformly those which soonest close.\n\nMrs Ibbetson says, contrary to the opinion of Mirbel, that the case in which the spiral vessels are inclosed is capable of being stretched; indeed it is formed of so thin (or rather so loose) a substance, as plainly to be intended to dilate and contract. The case is composed of a very few thin vessels, interlaced with an extremely fine spiral wire; while the larger spiral vessels fill up the case in an irregular manner, the nourishing vessels form a regular circle of tubes around it. See fig. 29, and 30.\n\nOf the Indian grass (andropogon contortum of Linne), of which Captain Kater's hygrometer is formed.\u2014The chief part of it is made with the spiral awn of an Indian grass, which readily untwists in a moist atmosphere, and vice versa. Now Mrs Ibbetson asks, if the most trifling change of moisture can untwist one foot of vegetable fibre, and by this means manage an instrument, why should not a quantity of similar formed fibres or spiral vessels produce the same effect on leaves and flowers? She says, Captain Kater's hygrometer moves very sensibly if a finger be placed within half an inch of the fibre (awn). Now, the most sensitive plant we have will not move but with the touch.\"\n\nWe are quite aware of the effects of moisture on some vegetables.\n\n(d) She found the spiral vessels also in the andropogon contortum.\nWe have strong proofs of it in some of the mosses, as in the *bryum hygrometricum*, which, if the fruitstalk be moistened at the bottom, makes three or four revolutions; if the upper part be moistened it turns the contrary way.\n\nWe can scarcely compare these motions with those of the mimosa; for it is quite evident that they are produced by moisture: but as we are to speak of the motions of the mimosa in a little, we would only observe, that when Mrs Ibbetton says \"the sensitive plant will not move but with the touch,\" she argues against herself; for this shows that it is acted upon by the same causes as animal muscles, and that it is not governed by moisture alone.\n\nThe only sensitive part of the Indian grass is the awn, which is formed of a leather-like substance, infinitely thicker and stronger than the usual spiral vessels in plants. The awn is formed of two apparently flat pieces, with a cylindric hollow running through the middle, which is filled with a thick spiral wire. Fig. 21, 22, 23, and 24. Each side of the awn is bristled; but the bristles do not add to its sensibility.\n\nOf the Nettle.\u2014The awn or fling of the nettle is a long pipe with a bag at the end, divided into two parts; the smaller contains the poison, and the larger is situated below it. This bag seems also to be composed of a leather-like substance, and is likewise affected by light and moisture.\n\nThe moment the upper part of the pipe is touched, the under part of the bag whirls up, breaks the poison bladder, and throws its contents violently up the pipe, burning the person who touches it.\n\nLight thrown upon the bag by means of the solar microscope, produces the same effect as touching it. The poisonous liquor is protruded up the pipe with great force, till it issues out at the minute aperture at the point; but before it does so, the pipe is bent down with a jerk, by means of the spiral wire.\n\nThe spiral wire winds round the bag at the bottom of the pipe; and it is by the action of this wire that the bag is made to contract. The nettle lays down its flings every evening, just as the sensitive plant does its branches. See fig. 19, and 20.\n\n*Mimosa Sensitiva.*\u2014The motions of this plant are regulated not only by the spiral wire, but also by a bag of a leather-like substance, which is capable of contraction and dilatation.\n\nWe shall next give Mrs Ibbetton's plate reflecting the structure of this plant, with her description.\n\nFig. 25. is a representation of the springs which govern each leaf; d, d is the stalk. Each leaf has a base e, e, which serves to concentrate the spiral wires. These falling over in every direction, being drawn through the narrowest parts of the stem b b b b, press the stem together; and, when touched, lay the leaves, one on the other, the whole way down the leaf-stalk. But, before the stimulus is applied, the stem is flattened in a contrary direction. The ball of the leaf is hollow, and filled with oil. The parts e e and p p (fig. 26.) are made of that leathery substance, which forms the cuticle, and is contracted by the light in the solar microscope. The parts e e contain the oil which serves to lubricate the knots (we suppose), and enable them to slip over each other; beside, probably, acting some important part in the formation of the various galls and juices in the composition of the plant.\n\nWhen touched, the whole string relaxes at o o, and lets the branch fall. This it would also do at m, if it were not supported by the wood-vessels turning into the leaf. Fig. 27. is the part e e p p uncut, and in its natural state. Mrs Ibbetton thinks that not only the motions of this plant, but of all others, depend upon the spiral wires which contract and dilate by the action of light and moisture. She adds, that there are no spiral wires in the seminal leaves of the *mimosa sensitiva*, and that the seminal leaves have no motion whatever.\n\nIn farther illustration of this subject, we shall next present our readers with some observations by Mr Lyall, lately published in Nicholson's Journal *, reflecting * Vol. xxv. the irritability of the *mimosa pudica*, and some other plants.\n\n\"It is well known (he observes), if we take a leaf of this plant, similar to what is represented (fig. 31.), and then, by means of a pair of scissors (completely dry), cut off half the pinnula A, this pinnula will contract at its joint, either immediately, or in a few seconds; its neighbour, or opposite pinnula, B, closing at the same time, or soon after.\n\n\"The pinnulae A and B having come into contact, there is a pause, or a short cessation, of motion; but in the course of a few more seconds, the next pair of pinnulae, CC, will also shut up, and the same will happen with every pair of pinnulae of that pinna successively; only with this difference, that the intervals between the shutting up of each pair of pinnulae will be shorter, the farther it is from the pinnula that was cut. After the whole of the pinnulae of this pinna have completely closed, and a little interval, then the joint D will bend so as to allow the pinna to drop considerably.\n\n\"Nevertheless, the motion is often not so obvious in this joint, as in that to be mentioned.\n\n\"A longer pause will now intervene, in some cases for so long as to make us suppose that all motion is at an end; but at length the joint E suddenly bends, and astonishes the beholder.\n\n\"The petiole F now, instead of forming an acute angle with the stem above the joint, forms a very obtuse angle with it.\n\n\"We shall now have another cessation of motion, and then the joint, H, will slightly bend; then another pause, then a shutting up of the pair of pinnulae, II, and so on with the other pinnulae, till the whole pinna is closed. The motions, however, will not be so regular in this pinna as they were in the other; for as the pinnulae II approach, they press forward the next pair, and so on with all the rest.\"\n\nThese motions, the author supposes, are not occasioned by impulse; for a bit of the pinnula may be cut off almost without producing any motion.\n\nBut, allowing that a little motion were produced, it comes naturally as a question, Why does the motion become so extensive? how is the impulse communicated to the origin of the petiole? The author does not think that these questions will ever be satisfactorily answered upon mechanical principles.\n\nHe admits indeed, that a structure exists in the *mimosa sensitiva*, corresponding to what Mrs Ibbetton has described.\ndescribed; although he seems to have some doubts respecting it. He then proceeds to inquire, whether by such a structure, acted upon by heat, light, or moisture, we could possibly explain the motions of the *mimosa pudica*. \"On the experiments above related, (he observes), I presume no one would say, that moisture was the cause of motion, as the cells were quite dry.\"\n\nIt is to be remembered also, that this plant will perform its motions under water.\n\nAs there was no change of light, consequently this had no share in the effect. Besides, when moisture is produced (Mr Lyall certainly means darkness) in consequence of the abstraction of light, all the pinnae shut up at the same time; not, however, in the regular order mentioned in the experiment. Neither does the motion take place from change of temperature, for the temperature was not altered.\n\nA great many questions will here suggest themselves, as, How does it happen that the motion is produced? how does it become so extensive? how comes it that there are regular motions and pauses, &c.?\n\nThe author concludes, by saying, that it is vain to attempt any mechanical solution of the phenomenon mentioned above, \"which would seem to depend on an exquisite irritability in the plant itself.\"\n\n*Dionaea Muscipula.*\u2014Mr Lyall does not think that the motions of this plant are to be explained in the manner spoken of by Broussonet, who ascribed them to an evacuation of a fluid from the leaf, which will be noticed when we speak of the *drosera*. For the leaf may be touched without causing any efflux of fluid whatever, and yet it will contract completely.\n\nComparetti's explanation respecting the motion of this plant is not admitted; because it seems improbable, is contrary to analogy, and inadequate to explain the phenomenon.\n\n*Of the Drosera Longifolia and Rotundifolia.*\u2014As many of the muscles of the animal system, as the heart, diaphragm, &c. act quite independent of the will, and as these parts are highly irritable, Mr Lyall wishes to show, that a voluntary command of a muscular force should not be taken into the definition of the word irritability, as has been done by some. Mr Lyall says, \"By irritability, I understand, that property inherent in some bodies (or rather parts of bodies), by which, when a stimulus is applied, they are enabled to contract.\n\nThe leaves of the *drosera rotundifolia*, when properly unfolded, lie round the stem in a stellated manner. The footstalks of the leaves vary in length from half an inch to an inch and a half. The leaves are covered on their upper surface by a number of hairs, varying also in length from one line to three-eighths of an inch, and are each terminated by a little gland, which gland is covered by a transparent viscid fluid, presenting a fine appearance.\n\nThe chief difference between the *drosera longifolia* and *rotundifolia* is in the shape of the leaves; those of the former being ovate, while those of the latter are of an orbicular shape.\n\nMr Lyall mentions the observations of Mr Whately, who, it would appear, was the first in this kingdom who described the contractions of the *drosera* when irritated.\n\nMr Whately and Mr Gardom had observed some insects imprisoned in the leaves of this plant, and hence were led to press with a pin the centre of other leaves in their natural and expanded form, when they very suddenly contracted, and, as it were, encircled the pin.\n\nRoth had noticed, in 1779, that the leaves of the *droserae* moved, when irritated. He placed an ant upon the middle of a leaf of the *drosera rotundifolia*, but so as not to disturb the plant. The ant endeavoured to escape, but was held fast by the clammy juice at the points of the hairs, which was drawn out by its feet into fine threads; in some minutes the short hairs on the disk of the leaf began to bend, then the long hairs, and laid themselves upon the insect. After a while the leaf itself began to bend, and in some hours the end of the leaf was so bent inwards as to touch the base. The same happened when the experiments were made on the *drosera longifolia*, but more rapidly.\n\nRoth also found that the hairs bent themselves when he touched them with the point of a needle, with a hog's bristle, or when he placed a very small piece of wood the weight of an ant upon the leaves.\n\nMr Lyall next gives us an account of his own experiments. He says, \"that for five months, he almost every day, had the species of *droserae* under his eye, either at home or in the country; and he confesses, that he never saw such a rapid contraction of the leaves of the *drosera rotundifolia*, as had been noticed by Mr Whately and Gardom: but in all his experiments the contraction was gradual, though it seldom failed to happen, if the plant was in good condition. In most of his experiments an hour was necessary for the complete bending of all the hairs; and it required some hours for the perfect shutting up of the leaves. Hence it is evident, that whoever has a wish to notice the motions of the *droserae*, must not set out with the expectation of seeing a rapid motion, similar to what happens in the mimosa; follow the application of a stimulus; but, to observe the ultimate effects, must watch with an attentive eye, for at least 20 minutes.\n\nIn accounting for the manner in which these motions are performed, various opinions have been held. Broussonet suspects that the disengagement of some fluids influences them. He says, that the insect, by absorbing the fluid which is on the points of the hairs, empties the vesicles of the leaf, which folds upon itself; and the quickness of the action is proportional to the number of hairs touched by the insect.\n\nOur author observes, that \"this theory, at first sight, does not appear even to be plausible; for, how is it possible that an insect can absorb a thick tenacious fluid?\" No doubt, however, part of this fluid will be attached to the part of the insect which touches it; but this seems quite unconnected with the contraction of the leaf. On the 30th of July, Mr Lyall brought from the country a number of plants of the *drosera rotundifolia*, and, on inspecting them, he found many of the hairs of the leaves deprived of their viscid fluid; but yet both they and the leaf remained quite expanded and in good condition. Next day, about four o'clock, he placed a small bit of sulphate of copper, in the disk of one of these expanded leaves, and by six o'clock most of the hairs on one side of the leaf, even the outermost, had bent themselves over the bit of copper; this seems\nVegetable to prove the inaccuracy of Broussonet's theory. In other experiments, he placed small bits of bread or wood, on three or four of the central hairs, without touching the other hairs, or the viscid fluid on their ends; and in a few hours he found that all the hairs had contracted around the foreign body. In some plants, the sulphate of copper was placed upon some of the small hairs in the dish of the leaf, without touching the leaf itself; yet the bending of the hairs and leaf was complete.\n\n\"We have here proof (he adds), 1st, That the leaves do not contract when deprived of their viscid fluid, which ought to have been the case if Broussonet's theory had been true. 2ndly, That the contraction takes place even when the viscid fluid does not cover the little glands. 3rdly, That the contraction follows, although the foreign body is not brought into contact with all the hairs.\n\nThe opinion of Sennebier, who appears to have ascribed the motions of the drosera to the effect of pressure is next examined. \"Sennebier seems (it is observed) sensible, that the contractions of the leaves take place even when light bodies are placed on them, which circumstance of itself would lead us to suspect, that pressure is not alone the cause.\n\n\"I know (it is added), that, if we press on the centre of a leaf with a pin, &c. we may cause its margin to approximate the pin; and this certainly would be owing to a mechanical cause. But, suppose we see the contraction take place, as I have done, when a body specifically lighter than the leaf itself is placed in the centre, as a bit of rotten wood; should we be still inclined to ascribe it to a mechanical cause? Admit that it is the case. Suppose, then, we place the same bit of wood on the margin of the leaf, what effect ought to follow? If it were owing to a mechanical cause, or the weight of the foreign body, as in the last-mentioned case, then we should expect, that the part of the margin of the leaf, on which the bit of wood rested, would be depressed; which undoubtedly is not the case: but, on the contrary, the margin rises, and then contracts towards the foreign body, or towards the footstalk of the leaf.\n\n\"That this motion does not depend on pressure, may be still better illustrated, by placing a fly, or some other body, on the apex of a leaf of the drosera longifolia. The hairs near the foreign body will contract around it, and then the apex of the leaf will rise upwards, and turn inwards, until it touches the base. Or, if the offending body is small, the leaf will become convoluted around it.\"\n\nFrom the result of his experiments, the author thinks, that the motions of the leaves of the drosera cannot be explained on mechanical principles. He conceives, that these motions are performed, if not by muscles, at least by something which is equivalent to muscles in the animal body.\n\nIt appears that the leaves of the drosera rotundifolia and longifolia remain completely expanded during the hottest sunshine and driest weather; during the coldest and wettest weather; during the greatest darkness, and finally, during the brightest light of day. This, however, is to be taken in a limited sense, i.e. only during the expansion of the leaves, not during the cold of winter.\n\n\"Here, then, neither heat, cold, dryness, dampness, darkness, nor light in general, at all affect the leaves; but, if a foreign body be applied to the leaf so as to fill Vegetable mulate, then it will shut up\" in the manner we have already described.\n\nEXPLANATION OF PLATES DXLI., DXLII., AND DXLIII.\n\n[Note, that some errors in the references to figures in the text may be corrected by this explanation, which is accurate.]\n\nFig. 1.

The pieces thus joined and glued, the work, if small, is put in a press; if large, it is laid on the bench, covered with a board, and pressed down with poles, or pieces of wood, one end whereof reaches to the ceiling of the room, and the other bears on the boards. When the glue is quite dry they take it out of the press and finish it; first with little planes, then with divers scrapers, some whereof resemble rasps, which take off dents, &c., left by the planes. When sufficiently scraped, the work is polished with the skin of which...\nVEN\n\na sea-dog, wax, and a brush and polisher of shave-grafs: which is the last operation.","sp":162,"ep":169},{"h":"VENEREAL","t":"something belonging to venery; as the lues venerae, &c.

Its dominions lay chiefly along the coasts at the head of the Adriatic sea, comprehending not only a considerable tract round the city of Venice, but several districts both to the east and west of that sea, together with the islands of Corfu, Zante, Cephalonia, Cerigo, and some others of less note in the Archipelago. It was bounded to the north by the Alps, to the west by the duchy of Milan, and to the east by Croatia, a province of Turkey in Europe.\n\nThe republic of Venice is said to have taken its rise from a small Italian colony, who in the middle of the 5th century were driven by Attila king of the Huns from the cities of Aquileia, Verona, Mantua, &c., and took refuge in the group of small islands where now stands the city of Venice. Here they established themselves, and formed a small independent state, adopting the consular form of government which had so long prevailed at Rome. By the end of the 5th century they had become of consequence, and were able to raise and maintain a fleet and a small army. They engaged in a war with the Lombards, and distinguished themselves against the Illyrian pirates, and the inhabitants of the neighbouring port of Trieste. They also assisted Justinian in his contest with the Goths, and received from him and his general Narses, many marks of favour and distinction.\n\nAbout the year 697, the tribunitian power, which had prevailed in Venice from the end of the 5th century, was abolished, and the states elected a supreme magistrate, whom they called doge, or duke. He was to represent the honour and majesty of the state; to assemble and preside at the great council, where he had a casting vote in all disputed points; to nominate to all offices, places, and preferments, and to enjoy the same authority in the church as in the state. Excepting a short intermission of about five years, the power of the doges continued till the fall of the republic.\n\nUnder the doges, the power and wealth of the republic continued to increase. In 765, the Heraclians and Gezulans, subjects of the republic, revolted, and threw themselves on the protection of the emperor Charlemagne. That emperor settled them for the present at Malamoe, in the neighbourhood of the Venetian capital; but from this asylum they were quickly driven by the forces of the republic. Incensed at this affront committed against his authority, Charlemagne ordered his son Pepin to declare war against the Venetians; but as Astolphus king of the Lombards was then laying waste the territories of the church, the troops of Pepin were, by the intrigues of the pope, dispatched against that powerful monarch; and though, on the defeat of Astolphus they marched against the Venetians, it does not appear that the enterprise was productive of either honour or success. The war with Pepin was renewed in 804, on occasion of Obelerio, the doge of Venice, shewing an inclination to favour the Greek emperor Nicephorus against Pepin. Obelerio was related to the French monarch, having married his sister; and as on this account the Venetians were jealous of the attachment of their doge, he was superseded, and Valentin nominated commander in his place. Pepin had collected a numerous and well appointed army, and had fitted out a fleet to act against the Venetians by sea. With this formidable force he advanced directly to Venice, but here he was opposed with all the valour of independent citizens fighting for their liberties.\n\nThe Venetians, however, notwithstanding the most obstinate defence, the most vigorous sallies, and their intrepidity selling every inch of ground at an incredible expense of the Venetian blood, were at length reduced to that part of the city nearest south of the Rialto (see the next article); this stream and An. 804. their own bravery, being now their only defence. While Pepin was preparing to throw a bridge over the canal, they resolved, as a last effort, to attack Pepin's fleet, and to vanquish or die in defence of their liberty. Embarking all the troops they could spare, they bore down with the advantage of the wind and tide, upon the enemy, and began the attack with such fury, as obliged the French admiral to give way. The lightness of their ships, and the knowledge of the foundings, gave the Venetians every advantage they could wish: the enemy's fleet was run aground, and the greater part of their troops perished in attempting to escape; the ships were all to a few either taken or destroyed. During this action at sea, Pepin resolved to assault the city by land, not doubting but the garrison was so weakened by the number of forces they had sent on board the fleet, as to be able to make but a slight resistance. Having for this purpose thrown a bridge over the Rialto, he was marching his troops across it, when he found himself attacked on every side by the Venetians from their boats, and others who had posted themselves on the bridge. The battle was long, bloody, and doubtful, until the Venetians employed all their power to break down the bridge; which at last yielded to their obstinate endeavours, a prodigious slaughter of the French ensued; they fought, however, like men in despair, seeing no hopes of safety but in victory; but all communication being cut off with the troops on shore, they were to a man either killed or drowned. The number of slain was so great, that the space between the Rialto and Malamoe was covered with dead bodies, and has ever since gone by a name expressive of the prodigious slaughter. Pepin was so struck with the intrepidity of the Venetians, that he raised the siege, abandoned the enterprise, and concluded a peace with the republic.\n\nIn 839, the Venetians engaged in an offensive and defensive alliance against the Saracens, with the Greek Venetian emperor Michael, to whose alliance they sent a fleet of sixty galleys. In an engagement which took place between the allied fleets and that of the Saracens, the former...\nmer were completely defeated, and almost all the Venetian galleys were either taken or destroyed. On the news of this defeat, the capital was thrown into the greatest consternation, justly dreading an attack from the victorious Saracens. This alarm, however, soon subsided, on finding that the barbarians had turned off on the side of Ancona. The city now became a prey to internal dissension. Popular tumults were frequent, and in one of these the doge was murdered. By the prudent and vigorous administration of a succeeding doge, Orso Participato, good order was re-established, and at the commencement of the 10th century, the reputation of the republic for military prowess was much advanced by a victory gained over the Huns, who had invaded Italy, and defeated Berengarius.\n\nTowards the close of the 11th century, Venice began to make a considerable figure among the states of Europe, having acquired the sovereignty of Dalmatia and Croatia, with which in 1084 they were formally invested by the Constantinopolitan emperor.\n\nAbout this time a crusade, or holy war against the Saracens, was preached up by the emissaries of the pope, and the Venetian republic engaged in the undertaking with such ardour, as to equip a fleet of 200 sail, under the command of the doge Vitalis Michael. Before he failed for the coast of Asia, however, the doge found it necessary to chastise the Pisans, whom he defeated in a terrible engagement. He then sailed for Asia, at that time besieged by the Christian forces, and it was chiefly by his valour that that city, as well as Caesarea and Tiberias, fell into the hands of the Christians. From these victories he was recalled to repel an invasion of Dalmatia by the Normans, whom he also defeated, carrying off considerable booty. His successor assisted Baldwin in the conquest of Ptolemais, but was defeated and killed in attempting to quell a rebellion of the Croatians.\n\nUnder the government of Domenico Micheli, who succeeded Ordelapho, the pope's nuncio arrived at Venice, and excited such a spirit of enthusiasm among all ranks and degrees of men, that they strove whose names should be first enrolled for the holy war. The doge, having fitted out a fleet of 60 galleys, sailed with it to Joppa, which place the Saracens were at that time besieging. The garrison was reduced to the last extremity when the Venetian fleet arrived, which surprized and defeated that of the enemy with great slaughter; soon after which the Saracens raised the siege with precipitation. Tyre was next besieged, and soon was obliged to capitulate; on which occasion, as well as on the taking of Acre, the Venetians shared two-thirds of the spoils. While the doge was absent on those important affairs, the emperor of Constantinople, jealous of the growing power of the Venetians, resolved to take advantage of their apparent incapacity to resist an attack at home. The Venetians, however, had timely notice of his approach, and instantly recalled the doge, who on his return laid waste and destroyed the country round Chios, seized on the islands of Samos, Lesbos, and Andros, then belonging to the emperor, and reduced several places in Dalmatia which had revolted.\n\nIn 1173, the republic ventured to oppose Frederick Barbarossa in his attack on the pope. Frederick, after a haughty reply to an embassy sent him by the Venetians, dispatched against them his son Otho, who soon arrived before the city with 75 galleys. The doge Sebastiano Ziani sailed out with the few vessels he had got equipped, to give the enemy battle. The fleets met off the coast of Itria, and a terrible engagement ensued, in which the imperial fleet was totally defeated, Otho himself taken prisoner, and 48 of his ships destroyed. On the doge's return, the pope went out to meet him, and presented him with a ring, saying, \"Take this, Ziani, and give it to the sea, as a testimony of your dominion over it. Let your successors annually perform the same ceremony, that posterity may know that your valour has purchased this prerogative, and subjected this element to you, even as a husband subjects his wife.\" Otho was treated with the respect due to his rank, and soon conceived a great friendship for Ziani. At last, being permitted to visit the imperial court, on his parole, he not only prevailed on his father to make peace with the Venetians, but even to visit their city, so famed for its commerce and naval power. He was received with all possible respect, and on his departure attended to Ancona by the doge, the senate, and the whole body of the nobility. During this journey he was reconciled to the pope; and both agreed to pay the highest honours to the doge and republic.\n\nIn the beginning of the 13th century, the Venetians They gain in conjunction with the French, besieged and took Con- possession of Constantinople, as has been related under the article Con-stantinopolitan History, No. 144\u2014149, which they held till the year 1261.\n\nIn the mean time the Genoese, by their successful War with application to commerce, having raised themselves in the Ge- such a manner as to be capable of rivalling the Vene-noese, tians, a long series of wars took place between the re- publics; in which the Venetians generally had the ad- vantage, though sometimes they met with terrible over- throws. These expensive and bloody quarrels undoubtedly contributed to weaken the republic notwithstanding its successes. In the year 1348, however, the Genoese were obliged to implore the protection of Visconti duke of Milan, in order to support them against their implacable enemies the Venetians. Soon after this, in the year 1352, the latter were utterly defeated with such loss, that it was thought the city itself must have fallen into the hands of the Genoese, had they known how to improve their victory. This was in a short time followed by a peace; but from this time the power of the republic began to decline. Continual war with the states of Italy, with the Hungarians, and their own rebellious subjects, kept the Venetians employed, so that they had no leisure to oppose the Turks, whose rapid advances might have alarmed all Europe. After the destruction of the eastern empire, however, in 1453 the Turks began more immediately to interfere with the republic. Whatever valour might be shewn by the Venetians, or whatever successe they might boast of, it is certain the Turks ultimately prevailed; so that for some time it seemed scarcely possible to resist them. What also contributed greatly to the decline of the republic, was the discovery of a passage to the East Indies by the Cape of Good Hope in 1497. Till then the greatest part of the East India goods imported into Europe passed through the hands of the Venetians; but as soon as the Cape was discovered, the conveyance by the way of Alexandria almost entirely ceased. Still, however, the Venetian power\npower was strong; and in the beginning of the 16th century they maintained a war against almost the whole force of France, Germany, and Italy, associated against them in what has been called the League of Cambrai. Soon after, however, we find them entering into an alliance with the king of France against the emperor.\n\nAfter this, nothing of importance occurs in the history of the Venetian republic till the year 1645, when the republic was involved in a new and languishing conflict with the Turks, in defense of the important island of Candia. The transactions to which this war gave rise, and the spirit and bravery displayed by the Venetians, in defending their colonial possessions, are amply detailed under the article CANDIA.\n\nAt the end of the 17th century, the Venetians obtained an important acquisition of territory by the conquest of the Morea, which at the peace of Carlowitz in 1699, was formally ceded by Turkey to the state of Venice*. During the war of the Succession, the states of Venice observed a strict neutrality. They considered that dispute as unconnected with their interests; taking care, however, to keep on foot an army on their frontiers in Italy, of sufficient force to make them respected by the belligerent powers. But soon after the peace of Utrecht, the Venetians were again attacked by their old enemies the Turks, who beholding the great European powers exhausted by their late efforts, and unable to assist the republic, thought this the favorable moment for recovering the Morea, which had been so lately ravished from them. The Turks obtained their object, and at the peace of Passarowitz in 1715, which terminated this unsuccessful war, the Venetian states yielded up the Morea; the grand seignior on his part restoring to them the small islands of Cerigo and Cerigetto, with some places which his troops had taken during the course of the war in Dalmatia.\n\nFrom the peace of Passarowitz to the conclusion of the 18th century, the affairs of Venice ceased to form an interesting part of the history of Europe. Ever since the league of Cambrai, the republic, weakened by its continual struggles with Turkey, had declined in power and in consequence, was incapable of opposing a barrier to the encroachments of its more powerful neighbors. During the first war which the French republic maintained against the emperor in Italy, the states of Venice afforded a tempting object to each of the contending parties; and in May 1797, the capital was occupied by a body of French troops, who, under pretence of quelling a tumult that had arisen in the city, took possession of the forts, and subverted the existing authorities. By the treaty of Campo Formio, concluded between the emperor and the French republic in October of the same year, the French consented that the emperor should take possession of the Venetian territory, with the islands in the Archipelago, which had been subjected to the Venetian republic; and by the subsequent treaty of Lun\u00e9ville in 1801, this acquisition of territory to the house of Austria was confirmed, so that the Venetian republic must now be considered as an Austrian province.\n\nIt is not necessary for us to be very minute in our account of the late constitution and government of Venice. The government was strictly aristocratical, being vested in the great council or senate, in which each of the nobility had a seat. The nobility were extremely numerous, being computed at not fewer than 2000, whereas the whole population of the state did not exceed 250,000. Besides the great council, or il consiglio grande, there were four others; one composed of the doge and six counsellors, called la signoria; another called il consiglio du pregadi, consisting of about 250 of the nobility; a third united to la signoria, consisting of 28 aldermen, or great lages, which gave audience to ambassadors; and a fourth, composed of 10 counsellors, who took cognizance of all criminal matters, and before whom even the doge himself must appear, if accused. The secret business of the state was often carried on by spies and informers; and there were in the ducal palace several statues of lions with open mouths, which formed so many receptacles for secret and anonymous information.\n\nThe office and privileges of the doge of Venice have been already mentioned under the article DOGE. Of late this office was little more than nominal; and the doge was a mere state puppet, without authority and without power. His establishment, however, was splendid, and his revenue not contemptible. The mode of electing the doge deserves notice, as it was well calculated to prevent bribery, or the exertion of party influence. He was elected by a plurality of voices, and held his dignity for life. In his election they made use of gold and silver balls, which were put into a vessel, and served for balloting. Those who drew nine golden balls, first elected 40 counsellors, who drew 12 others, and elected 25 in addition. Of this number nine persons, who had drawn golden balls, chose 40 more; 11 of those, appointed in the same way, chose 41 counsellors, who finally proceeded to the election, till 25 votes or more fell upon the same person, who was then declared doge. After this election they placed the ducal cap upon his head, upon which he took possession of the doge's palace. He never uncovered his head to any person, because he did not wear the cap in his own name, but in that of the republic.\n\nThe military strength of the Venetians consisted of nearly 30,000 land forces, under the command of a capitano, who was always a foreigner of distinction; besides a considerable fleet, which they boasted could, in time of war, be increased to 60 men of war, and above 100 galleys. The ordinary revenues of the state have been computed at rather more than 1,000,000l. sterling, a considerable part of which arose from the customs, and the duty on salt made at Corfu and Chioggia.\n\nVenice, the city which was the seat of government of the Venetian republic, is built on 72 small islands at the head of the Adriatic or gulf of Venice, about five miles from the main land. That part of the gulf which lies between the city and the continent forms a kind of laguna or lake, which, at low water, is very shallow, and on the opposite side of the islands there are numerous shallows, the channels between which are marked by stakes, to direct ships in entering the port. The lagunes that lie between the islands form so many canals that intersect the city in all directions, and over these the streets communicate by not fewer than 500 bridges. The principal or great canal is broad, and has a serpentine course through the middle of the city, but the others are narrow and crooked. The streets are also narrow and winding, but clean and neat. The houses are built on piles, and have each a door opening to the adjacent\nadjacent canal, and another to the street. As the narrowness of the streets but ill adapts them for walking in, the only places of resort on land are the Rialto, a noble bridge across the great canal, bordered with baths and shops, and the great square of St Mark, or Piazza di San Marco, an irregular quadrangle, formed of several buildings, some of which are magnificent. Of these, the ducal palace, where the business of the state used to be transacted; the patriarchal church of St Mark; the steeple of St Mark, at a little distance from the church; the church of St Geminiano; and the new and old Procuratie, are most deserving the notice of travellers.\n\nThe canals form the great medium of communication, as well as the principal scene of relaxation and amusement to the inhabitants. Here ply numerous gondolas, (see Gondola, and Macgill's Travels, vol. i.) which are rowed with admirable speed and dexterity by the gondoliers; and here are occasionally held races, or rather rowing matches. As the canals are, of necessity, the receptacles of all the filth of the city, they become, in hot weather, very offensive; while, in winter, from their free communication with the gulf, they are frequently agitated by the Adriatic storms. The whole city is about six miles in circumference, and the inhabitants are estimated at 160,000.\n\nThe inhabitants of Venice carried on a flourishing trade in silk manufactures, gold lace, mirrors and other articles of glass, besides military stores and implements of war. At some distance from the city there is a large and commodious lazaretto, where ships coming from the Levant unload their goods, and perform quarantine from 20 to 40 days.\n\nThis celebrated city, once the seat of power, opulence and the fine arts, whose carnival revelries have been the subject of so many animated descriptions, has undergone a melancholy change. Her streets and canals no longer resound with the strains of the musician and the serenades of watchful lovers, and her gay gondolas, which were formerly occupied by fashionable groups and parties of pleasure, are now become the vehicles of trade, or serve for the accommodation of the folder and the mechanic. The trade of the city, which had long declined, has, since the cession of the Venetian territory to Austria, been almost entirely transferred to Trieste. Venice is 72 miles E. by N. of Mantua; 115 N.

In the November following M. Trievald, military architect to the king of Sweden, informed Dr Mortimer secretary to the Royal Society, that he had in the preceding spring invented a machine for the use of his majesty's men of war, in order to draw out the bad air from under their decks, the least of which exhausted 36,172 cubic feet in an hour, or at the rate of 21,732 tons in 24 hours. In 1742 he sent one of them, formed for a 60 gun ship to France; which was approved of by the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris; and the king of France ordered all the men of war to be furnished with the like ventilators.\n\nThe ventilators invented by Dr Hales consist of a square box ABCD (fig. 1) of any size; in the middle of one side of this box a broad partition or midriff is fixed by hinges X, and it moves up and down from A to C, by means of an iron rod ZR, fixed at a proper distance from the other end of the midriff, and passing through a small hole in the cover of the box up to R. Two boxes of this kind may be employed at once, and the two iron rods may be fixed to a lever FG (fig. 2.) moving on a fixed centre O; so that by the alternate raising and pressing down of the lever FG, the midriffs are also alternately raised and depressed, whereby these double bellows are at the same time both drawing in air, and pouring it out, through apertures with valves made on the same side with, and placed both above and below the hinges of the midriffs. In order to render the midriffs light, they are made of four bars lengthwise, and as many across them breadthwise, the vacant spaces being filled up with thin panels of fir board; and that they may move to and fro with the greatest ease, and without touching the sides of the boxes, there is an iron regulator fixed upright to the middle of the end of the box AC (fig. 1) from N to L, with a notch cut into the middle of the end of the midriff at Z; so that the midriffs, in rising and falling, suffer no other friction than what is made between the regulator and the notch. Moreover, as the midriff ZX moves with its edges only one-twentieth of an inch from the sides of the box ABCDFE, very little air will escape by the edges; and, therefore, there will be no need of leathern sides as in the common bellows. The end of the box at AC is made a little circular, that it may be better adapted between A and C to the rising and falling midriff; and at the other end X of the midriff a flap of leather may be nailed over the joints if needful. The eight large valves through which the air is to pass, are placed at the hinge-end of the boxes BK (fig. 2.) as at 1, 2, 3, &c. The valve 1 opens inward to admit the air to enter, when the midriff is depressed at the other end by means of the lever FG. And at the same time the valve 3 in the lower ventilator is shut by the compressed air which passes out at the valve 4. But when that midriff is raised, the valve 1 shuts, and the air passes out at the valve 2. And it is the same with the valves 5, 6, &c. of the other box; so that the midriffs are alternately rising and falling, and two of the ventilators drawing in air, and two blowing it out; the air entering at the valves 1, 3, 6, 8, and passing out at the valves 2, 4, 5, 7. Before these last valves there is fixed to the ventilators a box QQNM (fig. 3.) as a common receptacle for all the air which comes out of these valves; which","sp":172,"ep":172},{"h":"VENUS","t":"one of the planets.

As we propose in this article to point out the means of destroying some of those animals that are hurtful or troublesome to man, we shall employ the term vermin, in a more extended sense, including also under it, mice, rats, moles, &c. We shall endeavour to collect the most useful observations that have been made on the means of diminishing or exterminating such animals as are obviously injurious. We cannot avoid here remarking, that although the seemingly excessive increase of one species of animals is hurtful or inconvenient to another, or to man himself, and their existence is attended with great loss and damage, by their infesting and destroying grains and other fruits of the earth destined for the food of man or those animals that are subservient to him; we are not of opinion that this excess ought to be considered merely as a useless excrement in the great scale of being; nor are we of opinion that their numbers ought not to be reduced, because we are too short-sighted to comprehend the wise purposes for which they are called into life. We have heard such a doctrine held up, although we are inclined to suspect that it is founded on a love of singularity or indolence, rather than proceeding from pure motives of benevolence. But we must abstain from such discussions, and occupy the limits allotted to the proper subject of consideration.\n\nRats and Mice.\u2014Various methods have been proposed for the destruction of these vermin. The following preparation has been recommended as very effectual. Take of the seeds of staveacre (delphinium lapathiflorum), or of lousewort (pedicularis palustris), powdered, more or less as the occasion requires, one part; of oatmeal, three parts; mix them well, and make them up into a paste with honey. Lay pieces of this paste in the holes, and on the places where mice and rats frequent; and it will effectually kill or rid the places of those kind of vermin by their eating of it.\n\nSome time ago the society for encouraging arts proposed a premium of 50l. for a preparation capable of alluring or fascinating rats so that they might be taken alive. In consequence of this, a great number of new traps, &c. were invented, and the following methods of alluring the rats to a certain place were published. One of the methods which is most easily and efficaciously practised, is the trailing of some pieces of their most favourite food, which should be of the kind which has the strongest scent, such as toasted cheese or boiled red herrings, from the holes or entrances of the closet to their recesses in every part of the house or contiguous building. At the extremities and at different parts of the course of this trailed track, small quantities of meal, or any other kind of their food, should be laid to bring the greater number into the tracks, and to encourage them to pursue it to the place where they are intended to be taken; at that place, when time admits of it, a more plentiful repast is laid for them, and the trailing repeated for two or three nights.\n\nBesides this trailing and way-baiting, some of the most expert of the rat-catchers have a shorter, and perhaps more effectual method of bringing them together; which is the calling them, by making such a whistling noise as resembles their own call; and by this means, with the affluence of the way-baits, they call them out of their holes, and lead them to the repast previously prepared for them at the places designed for taking them. But this is much more difficult to be practised than the art of trailing; for the learning of the exact notes or cries of any kind of beasts or birds, so as to deceive them, is a peculiar talent which is attained only by few.\n\nIn practising either of those methods of trailing or calling, great caution must be used by the operator to suppress and prevent the scent of his feet and body from being perceived; which is done by overpowering that scent, by other scents of a stronger nature. In order to do this, the feet are to be covered with cloths rubbed over with saltpetre, or other strong smelling substances; and even oil of rhodium is sometimes used for this purpose, but sparingly, on account of its high price, though it has a very alluring as well as disgusting effect. If this caution of avoiding the scent of the operators feet, near the track, and in the place where the rats are proposed to be collected, be not properly observed, it will very much obstruct the success of the attempt.\ntempt to take them; for they are very shy of coming where the scent of human feet lies very fresh, as it intimates to their sagacious instinct the presence of human creatures, whom they naturally dread. To the above-mentioned means of alluring by trailing, way-baiting and calling, is added another of very material efficacy, which is the use of oil of rhodium, which like the marum syriacum and valerian in the case of cats, has a very extraordinary fascinating power on these animals. This oil, as it is extremely dear, is therefore sparingly used. It is exalted in a small quantity in the place, and at the entrance of it, where the rats are intended to be taken, particularly at the time when they are to be last brought together, in order to their destruction; and it is used also by smearing it on the surface of some of the implements used in taking by the method below described; and the effect it has in taking off their caution and dread, by the delight they appear to have in it, is very extraordinary.\n\nIt is usual, likewise, for the operator to disguise his figure as well as scent, which is done by putting a sort of gown or cloak, of one colour, that hides the natural form, and makes him appear like a post, or some such inanimate thing, which habit must likewise be scented as above, to overpower the smell of his person; and besides this, he is to avoid all motion till he has secured his point of having all the rats in his power.\n\nWhen the rats are thus enticed and collected, where time is afforded, and the whole in any house and outbuildings are to be cleared away, they are suffered to regale on what they most like, which is ready prepared for them, and then to go away quietly for two or three nights; by which means those that are not allured the first night, are brought afterwards, either by their fellows, or the effects of the trailing, &c. and will not fail to come duly again, if they are not disturbed or molested. But many of the rat-catchers make shorter work, and content themselves with what can be brought together in one night; but this is never effectual, unless where the building is small and entire, and the rats but few in number.\n\nThe means of taking them when brought together are various. Some entice them into a very large bag, the mouth of which is sufficiently capacious to cover nearly the whole floor of the place where they are collected; which is done by smearing some vessel, placed in the middle of the bag, with oil of rhodium, and laying in the bag baits of food. This bag, which before lay flat on the ground with the mouth spread open, is to be suddenly closed when the rats are all in. Others drive or frighten them, by flight noises or motions into a bag of a long form, the mouth of which, after all the rats are come in, is drawn up to the opening of the place by which they entered, all other ways of retreat being secured. Others, again, intoxicate or poison them, by mixing with the repast prepared for them, the coccus indicus, or the nux vomica. They direct four ounces of coccus indicus, with 12 ounces of oatmeal, and two ounces of treacle or honey, made into a moist paste with strong beer; but if the nux vomica be used, a much less proportion will serve than is here given of the coccus. Any similar composition of these drugs, with that kind of food the rats are most fond of, and which has a strong flavour to lure that of the drugs, will equally answer the end. If indeed coccus indicus be well powdered, and infused in strong beer for some time, at least half the quantity here directed will serve as well as the quantity before mentioned. When the rats appear to be thoroughly intoxicated with the coccus, or sick with the nux vomica, they may be taken with the hand and put into a bag or cage, the door of the place being first shut, lest those who have strength and sense remaining should escape.\n\nIn destroying rats, advantage may be taken of that remarkable degree of instinct which they possess of departing on places, where they find themselves disturbed or harassed, and retiring to new haunts. It is well known, that after one or two rats are poisoned, or taken in traps, or wounded or otherwise injured, and afterwards permitted to escape, the whole colony immediately disappears. The practice, however, of destroying rats that frequent dwelling-houses, by poison, should be as much as possible avoided; for they retire to places behind the wainscot, &c. from which, after death, their putrid bodies emitting a most offensive smell cannot be removed. But it is far less difficult than is generally imagined to secure the different apartments of a dwelling-house, and even the cellars, from the inroads of rats and mice, and thus to prevent their unwelcome visits, by shutting up the passages through which they enter. Stone and lime, when they can be applied, are effectual; but common plaster, by introducing pieces of broken pottery ware or glass, along with it, will also answer the purpose; and even a piece of cork, with a pin or two stuck through it to prevent them from eating it away, is a complete barrier to mice entering through a hole in wood, and may even prevent the entrance of rats.\n\nWe have seen this method of shutting up the holes, as soon as they were opened by the industry of the enemy, readily pursued for some time, attended with the fullest success, even in an old house of considerable extent, and finished from top to bottom with wood, some of which was much decayed.\n\nOften for the sake of food, rats and mice frequent gardens, fields, and woods, in the summer season; but, on the approach of winter, they return to their former haunts in the habitations of man; and, accordingly, it is observed, that houses which are free from those vermin during the summer, swarm with them about the end of harvest. Attention to this circumstance in the habits of these animals, may be the means of securing us from their visits and depredations; for if, at the time alluded to, every hole and cranny through which rat or mouse can enter, be shut up, and carefully kept close and secure, the perseverance of the foe is exhausted and overcome by repeated and constant resistance, and thus he is forced to abandon the unequal contest, and to retire to other haunts where his motions are less interrupted.\n\nVarious other methods have been proposed for the destruction of rats; and although we have thrown out a hint against the use of arsenic for this purpose, in dwelling-houses; yet where it can be employed with perfect safety, and without risk of the nuisance alluded to, as in cellars and outhouses, it is undoubtedly one of the most effectual to which we can have recourse.\n\nSuffocating these vermin by means of the fumes of sulphur, as on board of ships, in granaries and other buildings which can be shut up, is sometimes also successfully\nVermin. Successfully practised. Rats and other vermin have also been effectually destroyed and eradicated by burning wood in close apartments, thus producing fixed air or carbonic acid gas, by which they are also suffocated.\n\nMoles.\u2014Various methods have been proposed for the destruction of these animals. But the following observations on this subject, which we shall give in the words of the author, seem to be more satisfactory than anything we have met with.\n\n\"The great damage (says he) which moles occasion in cultivated land, and particularly gardens, is well known; and the best means of remedying this evil is by destroying all those that make their appearance, as far as possible. The secrets which quacks sell for exterminating these destructive animals are of very little avail; and even poison produces no effect, as the mole does not drink, and lives only on roots and worms. In regard to gins and traps, the moles must be enticed to them by some kind of bait, which does not always produce the intended effect. Buffon advises a trench to be dug around the hills under which they conceal themselves, and thus to cut them off from all communication with the neighbouring ground. This method requires three or four people to dig trenches; and though it may prove effectual, it is attended with too much trouble. The other methods proposed by different naturalists are neither easier nor more certain.\n\n\"It is well known that this animal lives under the earth; and if at any time it comes forth from its holes, it is only when compelled to do so, in consequence of large quantities of water accumulated after the heavy rains which fall in summer, or when the earth is so much parched and dried by the continued drought, that it can no longer continue its labour; but it again creeps back into the earth when it finds a spot convenient for its purpose.\n\n\"This animal, as already remarked, feeds upon roots and worms, and for this reason is generally found in rich fertile soil; but never in that which is marly or stony. In the winter time it retires to elevated places, because it is there best secured from inundations. In summer, however, it descends to the low hillocks and flat land, and above all makes choice of meadows for the place of its residence; because it finds the earth there freer and softer for it to dig through. If the weather continues long dry, it repairs to the borders of ditches, the banks of rivers and streams, and to places contiguous to hedges.\n\n\"The mole breeds generally at the beginning of winter, and the months when they are found big with young are January and February. In the month of April a great many of their young may be seen. Among 122 caught in the month of May by my method, there were only four big with young. This animal cannot live without digging; it is obliged to find its nourishment in the bowels of the earth; and on that account is under the necessity of making those long subterranean passages which are found between one mole-hill and another. In general it begins to dig five or six inches under the surface; it scrapes the earth before it on one side till the quantity becomes too great for it to labour with ease; it then works towards the surface; and by pushing with its head, and the assistance of its nervous paws, gradually raises up the earth which inconveniences it, and which produces those small hills so common in fields. After getting rid of the earth in this manner, it proceeds forwards, and continues its labour as before. The farther it goes the more hills are produced. At each period of its labour it throws up four or five.\n\n\"In places overgrown with grass and shrubs, the mole is often contented with only forcing a passage through between the roots; and when the earth in gardens has been newly watered, it keeps itself at the depth of scarcely half an inch under the surface. This animal shews an equal aversion to great cold and violent heat; and in order to avoid both, it forces its way, when either prevail, to the greatest depth in the earth.\n\n\"It continues its labour at all times, because it is necessary for it to procure nourishment. It is absolutely false that it sleeps throughout the winter, as some naturalists have asserted; for it throws up the earth in the coldest season, as well as during the summer. It is most busily employed towards the end of winter, and at that period forms the greatest number of hills. To this it is impelled by more than one reason. In the first place, it must provide nourishment for its young; secondly, it finds it easiest at that time to dig its way through the earth; and lastly, as the air begins to be milder, the animal then recovers that strength which it had lost during the intense cold. At this season, therefore, it is most proper to pursue means for exterminating this animal, as it can be destroyed with greater ease while employed at its labour.\n\n\"The male is much stronger than the female, and the hills thrown up by the former are much larger as well as more numerous. The periods when the mole is most busily employed in digging are in the morning, at sunrise, at noon, and at sunset. In dry weather moles are observed to throw up the earth for the most part only at sunrise, and in winter when the earth has been somewhat heated by the sun's rays.\n\n\"A person may easily discover how many moles are contained in a certain space of ground, by counting the fresh raised mole-hills which have no communication with each other. I must remark also, that this animal has very bad sight, being almost totally blind; but its hearing, on the other hand, is so much the more acute.\n\n\"I shall now proceed to the method of destroying them. Immediately at day-break it will be necessary to make a tour round the garden or meadow, from which it is wished to exterminate the moles; for at that time they will be all found at work, as may be seen by the hills newly thrown up. If the person is then close to the hill, he must proceed as the gardeners do, and turn up with a spade the hill together with the digger. The passage is then cut through before the animal is aware of the attack, and therefore it has not power to escape. If the mole-hill be fresh, even though the animal may not be throwing up earth, the person ought not to lose his time in waiting, but should immediately proceed to the operation above mentioned.\n\n\"If you find a fresh hill standing by itself, which seems to shew by its situation that it has no communication with any other, which is always the case when the mole has worked from the surface downwards in endeavouring to procure a more convenient habitation, after the hill has been turned up with the spade, a bucket of water should be poured over the mouth of the passage. By these means the animal, which is at no great distance, will be obliged to come forth, and may be easily caught with the hand.\n\n\"You\n\"You may discover also whether a hill has any communication with another, if you apply your ear to it, and then cough or make a loud noise. If it has no communication with the neighbouring hills, you will hear the terrified animal make a noise by its motion. It will then be impossible for it to escape; and you may either pour water into the hole, or turn up the hill with a spade until the mole is found; for in general it never goes deeper into the earth than from fifteen to eighteen inches.\n\n\"When any of the beds in a garden have been newly watered, the mole, attracted by the coolness and moisture, readily repairs thither, and takes up its residence in them, making a passage at the depth of scarcely an inch below the surface. In that case it may be easily caught. When you see it at work, you need only tread behind the animal with your feet on the passage to prevent its retreat, and then turn up the hill with a spade; by which means you will be sure to catch it.\n\n\"When you dig after it with a spade, the animal forces its way downwards into the earth in a perpendicular direction, in order that it may better escape the threatened danger. In that case it will not be necessary to dig long, but to pour water over the place, which will soon make the animal return upwards.\n\n\"People in general are not aware of the great mischief occasioned in fields and gardens by these animals. We are, however, informed by Buffon, that in the year 1740 he planted 15 or 16 acres of land with acorns, and that the greater part of them were in a little time carried away by the moles to their subterranean retreats. In many of these there were found half a bushel, and in others a bushel. Buffon, after this circumstance, caused a great number of iron traps to be constructed, by which in less than three weeks he caught 1350. To this instance of the devastation occasioned by these animals, we may add the following: In the year 1742 they were so numerous in some parts of Holland, that one farmer alone caught between five and six thousand of them. The destruction occasioned by these animals is, however, no new phenomenon. We are informed by history, that the inhabitants of the island of Tenedos, the Trojans, and the \u00c6olians, were infested by them in the earliest ages. For this reason a temple was erected to Apollo Smythius, the destroyer of moles.\n\n\"Insects.\u2014Many insects, in the different states of existence through which they pass, are exceedingly troublesome and destructive. Sometimes they spread their devastations in the state of larva or grub, and sometimes in that of perfect insect.\n\n\"Of the coleopterous insects, the grub of the cockchafer, which is a brownish or chestnut-coloured beetle, commits the greatest ravages. This beetle appears during great part of the summer, the most plentiful in May or June, and hence called the May bug. It flies only in the evening, and lodges during the day under the leaves of trees, which it devours, and is sometimes in such numbers, as to defoliate whole woods. The beetle deposits its eggs in the earth, and from these are hatched white or bluish grubs, that feed on the roots of grass, corn, and other vegetables, during the whole summer. In the winter they lie deep in the earth; but in the spring, as vegetation advances, they rise to the surface, and renew their work of destruction. In this state they continue for four, five, or six years, before they change to the chrysalis state, in which they remain till the month of May, when the perfect insect appears. As these insects require so many years to assume the perfect form, they only appear occasionally sufficiently numerous to be extensively destructive to the crops of grain, or vegetables in general. Their numbers, however, have often produced great alarm, and even excited the attention of governments to offer rewards for an effectual method of destroying them.\n\n\"In the spring season, if the weather prove warm, when the land is ploughed up, these grubs are generally near the surface as to be turned up with the plough; and being thus exposed, they are picked up and devoured by various birds, which, it is suspected, should not be disturbed or driven away in this salutary labour. When these grubs infest meadow land, it has been proposed to drown them in their holes by overflowing it. But it is supposed that this plan would not be successful, even where it is practicable, unless there is a bed of clay immediately under the soil, to retain the water for a sufficient length of time. A more efficacious way is recommended to prevent the increase of the grubs, by destroying the flies in May or June, before they have deposited their eggs. This may be done by shaking and beating the trees and hedges in the middle of the day; and, as this is a work which may be performed by children, it is a less difficult task than would at first sight be imagined. Domestic fowls are remarkably fond of these beetles, so that a double object is thus gained, the destruction of the beetles and the procuring of food for the poultry.\n\n\"Some species of the dermestes, and also of the genus pinus, are exceedingly destructive in the cabinets of naturalists, and also to furniture. Various methods have been recommended to stop their ravages. We believe the most effectual is spirit of turpentine, when it can be properly applied. A solution of corrosive sublimate is sometimes employed, but it should be recollected that it seldom fails in time to produce some chemical change on animal and vegetable matters. Objects of natural history as birds, animals, &c., are sometimes exposed to the moderate heat of an oven, or before a fire, for several hours; but this method will also be attended with injurious effects, unless practised with great care. Insects which infect furniture have been destroyed by the application of oil, and allowing it to remain for a day or two, before the furniture is rubbed up. Japanned or varnished furniture may be secured from the effects of these insects, by re-coating it, when they are in the larva state, by which they are deprived of air. Railing, and other works out of doors, which are exposed to the weather, are sometimes eaten with insects, and particularly by some of the larvae of the genus curculio. The wood thus attacked may be prevented from farther ravages, by a fresh coat of paint.\n\n\"The earwig is a destructive insect in the flower, kitchen, and fruit garden. To prevent their depredations, it has been recommended to take them by the hand, when they come out during the night in search of food. They may be taken also by rolling up a piece of paper, and hanging it up on the plants which they infest; for in these places they take shelter through the day. Another method of destroying them has been mentioned, and that is to watch them towards morning with the view of discovering the haunts to which they...\nthey resort during the day; and this discovery being made, which may perhaps be a melon frame, dunghill, or heap of rubbish, the removing of which will destroy the greater number of these troublesome insects.\n\nThe small insect which commits such depredations among turnips, by eating the feeding leaves as soon as they appear, as frequently to destroy whole crops, is supposed to be a small black polished beetle, belonging to the genus *Chrysomela*. It does not seem to be well ascertained whether this small beetle, which is better known by the name of turnip fly, commits its ravages in the larva or in the beetle state. It is said that it prefers the leaves of the common radish to those of the turnip, and it is therefore recommended to sow radishes along with the turnips, to prevent the destruction of the latter.\n\nOf the insects belonging to the order hemiptera, there are some which are exceedingly destructive. The cockroach, a native of the warmer parts of America and the West Indies, is a very troublesome, and a very voracious insect. It has been introduced into this country, and particularly into the seaport towns, in consequence of commercial intercourse. It comes out to feed in the night-time, and eats almost of every thing that comes in its way. Cock-roaches are easily taken by the following method. Cover the outside of a deep glass or basin with paper; introduce some bits of bread or sugar into the basin or glass, and set it in a place frequented by the cock-roaches. They creep up by means of the paper on the outside, and drop into the vessel; but in consequence of its smooth polished surface, they cannot effect their escape. In the same way crickets and beetles may be taken and destroyed. It is quite unnecessary to speak of the means of destroying the myriads of locusts which not unfrequently infest eastern countries, and particularly Egypt and Syria; for no means are likely to be devised, which promise to resist the effects of such a host of foes, by whose ravages every green thing is consumed; but the insect itself becomes, among the poorer inhabitants of those countries, a partial substitute for the fruits of the earth which it has destroyed. The insects are taken, reduced to powder, and converted into a kind of meal.\n\nThe common or the bed-bug is a very troublesome, and a very common inmate in the crowded houses of many large towns in this country. Its usual haunts are the crevices of wood, and particularly those pieces of furniture which are usually kept in the warmest corners of the apartment. Cleanliness will perhaps be found the best preservative against the introduction and increase of these insects; but sometimes even the greatest care and attention are ineffectual in keeping houses entirely free from them. When it can be conveniently done, they are completely destroyed by immersing the furniture in boiling water, or by baking it in an oven; and by filling up the crevices or holes which were their haunts, with glaziers putty, their return and increase will thus be prevented. But a very effectual method of destroying bugs, is to wash the places which they frequent with spirit of turpentine, and then filling up the holes as already mentioned. It is a curious circumstance in the history of these insects, that some persons entirely escape from their attacks, while to others they are exceedingly troublesome and distressing. It is said that lavender-water, sprinkled over the bed-clothes, often prevents their approach. How far this is the vermin, we have had no opportunity of ascertaining.\n\nThe small moth, which in the caterpillar state commits such ravages on woollen cloths, furs, and other animal substances, which remain for any length of time in dark undisturbed places, may be destroyed with the greatest certainty and facility, by exposing the substances on which they are suspected to make their depredations, to the vapour of spirit of turpentine, or brushing them with a brush dipped into the same fluid. This should be done about the months of September or October; but their effects may be prevented by placing the cloths, furs, &c., which are likely to become their residence, in an airy situation, about the months of July and August.\n\nThe different kinds of lice are very numerous. Every animal has its peculiar species, and even mankind are not free from this pest. It is often the consequence of indolence and naughtiness, and it is observed that the lice which infest any animal increase prodigiously when that animal becomes languid and sickly. We believe that the application of spirits of turpentine, already so often recommended, would also be effectual in this case; but mercurial preparations afford a certain remedy against these insects. For this purpose a very small quantity of what is called mercurial ointment may be employed. At the same time it ought to be recollected, that cleanliness is the best preservative. A singular notion prevails in this country, and even among persons who are by no means in the lowest rank of life, that it is a good sign of health when children's heads are infested with these animals; and on this account they are not very anxious in having them entirely eradicated. A moment's reflection may show the absurdity of such an opinion, so that it would be a waste of time to adduce serious arguments against it.\n\nIt is perhaps more difficult for mankind to secure themselves and their habitations from the visits of the common flea. Cleanliness, however, may do much even in effecting this; and in particular it appears to us, that it would be extremely useful, frequently to rub up with a piece of cloth the more inaccessible parts of furniture or apartments, or perhaps it would answer better to employ a small hard brush. By the less accessible places we mean the corners and crevices of rooms and furniture where dust is apt to collect, and especially the canvas part of a bed. We are persuaded that spirits of turpentine might also be found useful for the destruction of these very troublesome insects. The Scotch myrtle (*Myrica gale*, Lim.) a plant very common in low and moist moorish places in this country, is said to be an excellent remedy, in consequence of its powerful aromatic odour, against the attacks of these animals. For this purpose, the plant is strewn about the apartment or bed which is infested with fleas.\n\nThe following method of destroying or driving away all kinds of noxious vermin from fields and gardens, it is said, has been proved by experience to be effectual. It is recommended by M. Scoloff, and the account of it is taken from the *Philosophical Transactions*. As the destructive power of quicklime (says the author), heightened by a fixed alkali, which corrodes, dissolves and destroys all the tender parts of animals, has been long known, I thought this mixture would be the best means for accomplishing the object I had in view. I took three\nthree parts, therefore, of quicklime, newly made, and two parts of a saturated solution of fixed alkali in water, and thence obtained a somewhat milky liquor sufficiently caustic, highly noxious and poisonous to earthworms and other small animals; for, as soon as it touched any part of their bodies, it occasioned in them violent symptoms of great uneasiness. If this liquor be poured into those holes in which the earthworms reside underground, they immediately throw themselves out as if driven by some force; and, after various contortions, either languish or die. If the leaves of plants or fruit-trees, frequented by the voracious caterpillars, which are so destructive to them, be sprinkled over with this liquor, these insects suddenly contract their bodies and drop to the ground. For, though nature has defended them tolerably well by their hairy skins from anything that might injure their delicate bodies, yet, as soon as they touch with their feet or mouths leaves which have been moistened by this liquor, they become as it were stupified, instantly contract themselves, and fall down.\n\n\"I had not an opportunity of trying a like experiment on locusts; yet we may conclude, and not without probability, from their nature and the general destructive qualities of the above liquor, that they, in like manner, may be driven from corn-fields, if it be possible to sprinkle the corn with the liquor by means of a machine.\n\n\"With regard to plants or corn, these sustain no injury from the liquor, because it has no power over the productions of the vegetable kingdom, as I have fully learned from experience; or, if any hurt be suspected, all the danger will be removed by the first shower that falls. This liquor may be procured in abundance in every place where lime is burnt. If the lime be fresh, one part of it infused in about seventy parts of common water will produce real lime-water. The want of the fixed alkali may be supplied by boiling wood ashes in water, and thickening the ley by evaporation.\n\n\"The liquor might be employed also to kill bugs and other domestic insects which are noxious and troublesome; but on account of its strong, lachrymatory smell, which offends the human body to putridity, I dare not recommend the use of it in houses that are inhabited. Besides, bugs may be easily got rid of, as I have repeatedly found from experience, by the oily pickle that remains in casks in which salted herrings have been packed. To this liquor they have a strong aversion; and, if they are moistened with it, they die in a very short time.\"\n\nFor deflouring insects and caterpillars, which infest fruit trees, the following method is recommended as having been successfully practised. The author observes that \"The present year, for instance, (1805), offers a singularity which I have not before perceived. In some districts the cherry-tree has experienced, at the time of its blossoming, colds and winds which have prevented it from setting; but another plague, not less disastrous, has attacked the cherry-trees and plum-trees over several districts in France. Great swarms of little animals resembling vine-frettters, but which are not so in reality, established their habitations at the extremity of the branches of the cherry-trees. As soon as a branch was attacked, the leaves curled, and the juice was dried up. On opening the leaf, a considerable number of ants was discovered, which, jointly with the insect which began the ravages, fucked the branch, and made it wither. What I have remarked is, that usually, when the vine-fretters attack any tree, the neighbouring tree very soon experiences the same fate; but the attack of this year is only partial. In an alley of cherry-trees which I polled seven trees have been attacked, but not those which are next each other. One tree was placed between two which were very much damaged by these insects, and yet this one was not hurt.\n\n\"On these vermin the smoke of tobacco had no effect at all: this convinces me that they are different from the ordinary kind.\n\n\"Plum-trees, when attacked by the same insect, do not lose their fruit like the cherry-trees; but the little animals cover them with more rapidity, so as to extinguish even the appearance of fruit.\n\n\"Having effectually watered a plum-tree, I covered it with ashes, in the manner we treat beans and cabbages, and the vermin were destroyed; but this is only practicable with a tree of low height.\n\n\"I made one remark, which I think is essential to communicate: it is, that plum-trees planted in ground which is not necessarily watered, are less attacked by these insects than those which have experienced a humidity communicated by the plants in their neighbourhood, to which watering is absolutely necessary. I had one planted in a bed of artichokes: we know very well that this plant requires plenty of water; and the tree was entirely covered with insects. Its leaves withered, and the fruit fell off; while two other plum-trees, in ground not watered at all, were much less attacked. This convinces me that these were not the ordinary vermin abundant in dry seasons.\n\n\"I was only able to protect my cherries a little, by cutting off the extremities of the damaged branches.\n\n\"Several people had recourse to sulphur; but I did not follow that method. The smoke of sulphur destroys the insect, I admit, but it is at least equally dangerous to the tree; I always prefer an asperion of the tree with soap-suds. This very year I experienced the good effects of it. I saw my plum-trees look green again, and the insects abandon them. The asperion is very easily managed, by means of watering-pots or small garden-engines. I have also employed a ley of wood-ashes with the same success as soap and water.\n\n\"An observation equally important which I have made is, the great damage done this season in all orchards by the caterpillar. As soon as they devoured the young leaves, they attacked the fruit. In spite of the great care taken in spring to get rid of them, the number of these insects is incredible. I have seen them unite on the large branches, fix their nests to them, and protect them by means of the downy matter which covers the buds of the ensuing season. Whatever precaution is taken, it is almost impossible not to destroy these buds. It is only necessary to take off these nests and burn them; and this is the only way of getting rid of the coves. I employed the same asperion for my apple-trees, and by that means got rid of their enemies also.\n\n\"The following methods are practised in Germany for freeing granaries from mites or weevils:\n\n\"I. Cover completely the walls and rafters, above and below, of the granaries which are infested by weevils.\"\nVermi. vils, with quicklime flaked in water in which trefoil, wormwood, and hyssop have been boiled. This composition ought to be applied as hot as possible.\n\n2. A very sagacious farmer has succeeded in destroying weevils by a very easy process. In the month of June, when his granaries were all empty, he collected great quantities of the largest-sized ants in sacks, and then scattered them about the places infested with the weevils. The ants immediately fell upon and devoured every one of them; nor have any weevils since that time been seen on his premises.\n\n3. Another method, not less efficacious, but which requires a great deal of care and attention in the application of it, is the following:\u2014Place in your granaries a number of chafing-dishes filled with lighted pieces of wood. Every aperture must then be carefully closed, in order to prevent any fresh air from entering. The carbonic acid gas, produced from the burning wood, proves fatal to the insects. Rats and mice, also, are so strongly affected by it, that they are seen running out of their holes, and dying in all directions. The persons employed to manage this process must take great care of their own safety, by keeping a current of air around them until the burning wood is properly placed. Another danger may arise from the premises taking fire; but this also may be avoided by proper caution, particularly if they are paved with brick or stone.*\n\n4. Grain, it is said, has been preserved from weevils and other destructive insects, by covering the heaps with pieces of hemp cloth dipped in water and wrung out. At the end of two hours the weevils are found adhering to the cloths, which are to be removed carefully and plunged in water for some time to drown. A plant of henbane placed in the middle of a heap of grain is said also to drive away the insects. They must then be watched and destroyed as they attempt to escape.\n\nSulphur or flower of brimstone is recommended as being an excellent remedy against the effects of insects on plants. It may be applied by dusting the leaves affected, either by tying it up in muslin cloth, or with a puff for hair powder, or with a dredging box. But the sulphur not only destroys the worms and insects which infest trees; it seems also to render the trees more healthy and vigorous. This was particularly the case with some peach trees on which it was sprinkled.\n\nThe following method, discovered by M. Cain, is proposed for destroying earth-flies, bugs, ants, &c.\n\nTake black soap, of the best kind, one pound three quarters, the same quantity of flowers of sulphur, mushrooms two pounds, and sixty measures of river or rain-water. Divide the water into two parts, one of which must be poured into a vessel destined for that purpose: suffer the soap to dissolve in it, and add the mushrooms after they have been a little pounded. Boil the other half of the water in a kettle, and tie up the sulphur in a bit of rag or piece of fine linen, and suspend from it a sufficient weight in order that it may sink in the water. During the time the water is kept boiling, which must be at least twenty minutes, stir it continually with a stick, and press the bag containing the sulphur, that the latter may be forced out into the water, and communicate to it the necessary fire, girth and colour.\n\nWhen the liquor is taken from the fire, pour it directly into the cask, and stir it round for a considerable time: the process of stirring must be repeated daily till it acquire a fetid smell. Experience has shown that the more fetid the mixture is, its activity is the greater. Each time that the mixture is stirred, the cask must be stopped immediately after. When you wish to use the liquid, nothing is necessary but to sprinkle a little of it on the plants which you are desirous of preserving, or to dip their branches in it. It will be better, however, to make use of a syringe, having at the end a head, an inch or an inch and a half in diameter, pierced with small holes. This instrument may be used for tender plants; when you apply the liquid to trees, a syringe with larger holes must be employed.\n\nCaterpillars, beetles, earth-fleas, bugs, and the tree-lice which infest orange trees, will be destroyed by the first application of the liquid. Insects which reside below the earth, such as wasps, hornets, ants, &c., require that the liquid should be squirted out gently, and without intermission, that it may better penetrate to their nests. Ants nests, according to their size, require from two to three measures of liquid, and in many cases it must be applied for twenty-four hours. When the ants assemble in another place, the process must be repeated. Two ounces of nux vomica may be added to the mixture, and boiled along with the sulphur. This sublimate, particularly when you wish to destroy ants, will be of great service. When the whole of the liquid in the cask has been used, the residue must be buried in the earth to prevent domestic animals from eating it.*\n\nThe use of elder as a preservative to vegetables against the depredations of insects is detailed in the following observations.\n\nCommon elder has appeared to me useful, 1st, For preventing cabbage plants from being devoured or damaged by caterpillars; 2d, To prevent blights, and their effects on fruit and other trees; 3d, To preserve corn from yellow flies and other insects; 4th, To secure turnips from the ravage of flies, &c.\n\n1st, The strong and fetid odour of a bunch of elder leaves induced me to think that different kinds of butterflies might be inconvenienced by it in proportion to their delicacy. I therefore took some young twigs of elder, at the period when butterflies began to appear, and whipped well with them some cabbage plants, but in such a manner as not to damage them. Since that time, during two summers, though the butterflies hovered round the plants, I never saw one of them settle on them; and I do not think that a single butterfly was hatched on the cabbages treated in this manner, though a neighbouring board was dirtied by them in the usual manner.\n\n2d, After a short reflection on the effects here mentioned, and on blights, which, in my opinion, are chiefly occasioned by small flies and small insects, whose organs are still more delicate than those of the former, I was induced to whip in the same manner with elder twigs, as high as I could reach, the branches of a plum-tree which grew in an espalier. The whipped leaves remained green and in a good condition, while from at least six inches above to the top of the tree the rest of the leaves were blighted, wrinkled, and full of worms. It is here to be observed that the tree was in full flower when I whipped it, therefore much too late for this operation, which ought to have been performed once or twice before flowering. But I am of opinion, that if trees were besprinkled with a strong infusion of elder every\nevery eight or 15 days, the success would be certain, and that there would be no danger of injuring either the flowers or the fruit.\n\n3rd. What the farmers call the yellows in corn, and which they consider as a kind of blight, is the effect, as every one knows, of a small yellow fly with blue wings, nearly of the size of a gnat. It lays its eggs in the ear of wheat, and produces a worm almost invisible to the naked eye, but which, when seen by a magnifying glass, is a large yellow larva, having the shining colour of amber. This fly is so productive, that I have counted upwards of forty worms in the chaff of one ear of wheat, which was a number sufficient to destroy it entirely. I therefore proposed to make my experiment as soon as possible; but the heat and drought of the season having advanced the wheat more than usual, it was in flower before I could attempt it. Next morning, however, at break of day, two servants having drawn bundles of elder over the ears of wheat on each side of the furrow, backwards and forwards, in places where the wheat was not so far advanced, I hoped that the fetid effluvia of the elder would prevent the flies from remaining on the ears that were covered with them: and, indeed, I was not entirely disappointed; for, on examining my wheat some time after, I found that the part which had been beaten with elder was much less damaged than that which had not been treated in the same manner. I have no doubt, that, had I employed this precaution sooner, the corn would have been completely preserved. Should this be the case, the process is simple; and I flatter myself that fine crops of corn may be saved by these means from this small insect, which is so destructive to them. One of these yellow flies laid on my thumb at least eight or ten eggs, of an oblong form, in the small interval of time which I employed in walking over two or three furrows, holding it by the wings, and which I could not observe without the assistance of a magnifying glass.\n\n4th. It often happens that whole crops of turnips are destroyed while young, in consequence of being pricked by certain insects. I have great reason to think that this evil may be prevented in an effectual manner, by causing a person to draw a bunch of elder, sufficiently large to cover about the breadth of a foot, over the young turnips, going backwards and forwards. What confirms me in this idea is, that, having drawn a bunch of elder over a bed of young cauliflowers which had begun to be pricked, they afterwards remained untouched by these insects.\n\nAnother fact which tends to support this idea is, that when my neighbourhood, about eight or nine years ago, was so infested with caterpillars that they devoured all the vegetables, leaving scarcely a green leaf untouched, they spared the elder trees amidst this general devastation, and never molested them. In reflecting on these circumstances, I am of opinion that the elder might be introduced with advantage into our gardens, as the means of preserving fruit-trees and various plants from the rapacity of insects.\n\nThe dwarf elder appears to me to exhale a much more fetid smell than the common elder, and therefore ought to be preferred in making experiments on this subject.*","sp":174,"ep":181},{"h":"VERNACULAR","t":"a word applied to something that is peculiar to any one country.","sp":181,"ep":181},{"h":"VERNAL","t":"something belonging to the spring-season.","sp":181,"ep":181},{"h":"VERNIER SCALE","t":"a scale excellently adapted for the graduation of mathematical instruments, thus called from its inventor Peter Vernier, a person of distinction in the Franche Comt\u00e9. See NONIUS.\n\nVernier's method is derived from the following principle. If two equal right lines, or circular arcs, A, B, are so divided, that the number of equal divisions in B is one less than the number of equal divisions of A, then will the excess of one division of B above one division of A be compounded of the ratios of one of A to A, and of one of B to B.\n\nFor let A contain 11 parts, then one of A to A is as 1 to 11, or \\(\\frac{1}{11}\\). Let B contain 10 parts, then one of B to B is as 1 to 10, or \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\). Now \\(\\frac{1}{10} - \\frac{1}{11} = \\frac{11-10}{10 \\times 11} = \\frac{1}{10 \\times 11} = \\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{1}{11}\\).\n\nOr if B contains \\(n\\) parts, and A contains \\(n+1\\) parts; then \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) is one part of B, and \\(\\frac{1}{n+1}\\) is one part of A.\n\nAnd \\(\\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{n+1} = \\frac{n+1-n}{n \\times n+1} = \\frac{1}{n} \\times \\frac{1}{n+1}\\).\n\nThe most commodious divisions, and their aliquot parts, into which the degrees on the circular limb of an instrument may be supposed to be divided, depend on the radius of that instrument.\n\nLet R be the radius of a circle in inches; and a degree to be divided into \\(n\\) parts, each being \\(\\frac{1}{p}\\)th part of an inch.\n\nNow the circumference of a circle, in parts of its diameter \\(2R\\) inches, is \\(3,1415926 \\times 2R : : 10 : \\frac{3,1415926}{360} \\times 2R\\) inches.\n\nOr, \\(0,01745329 \\times R\\) is the length of one degree in inches.\n\nOr, \\(0,01745329 \\times R \\times p\\) is the length of \\(1^\\circ\\), in \\(p\\)th parts of an inch.\n\nBut as every degree contains \\(n\\) times such parts, therefore \\(n = 0,01745329 \\times R \\times p\\).\n\nThe most commodious perceptible division is \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) or \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\) of an inch.\n\nExample. Suppose an instrument of 30 inches radius, into how many convenient parts may each degree be divided? how many of these parts are to go to the breadth of the vernier, and to what parts of a degree may an observation be made by that instrument?\n\nNow \\(0,01745 \\times 1 = 0,5236\\) inches, the length of each degree: and if \\(p\\) be supposed about \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) of an inch for one division; then \\(0,5236 \\times p = 4,188\\) shows the number of such parts in a degree. But as this number must be an integer, let it be 4, each being \\(1^\\circ\\): and let the breadth of the vernier contain 31 of those parts, or \\(7^\\circ\\), and be divided into 30 parts.\n\nHere \\(n = \\frac{1}{4}; m = \\frac{1}{30}\\); then \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{1}{120}\\) of a degree,\nVernier degree, or $30'$, which is the least part of a degree that instrument can show.\n\nIf $n = \\frac{1}{5}$ and $m = \\frac{1}{36}$; then $\\frac{1}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{60}{5 \\times 36}$ of a minute, or $20''$.\n\nThe following table, taken as examples in the instruments commonly made from 3 inches to 8 feet radius, shows the divisions of the limb to nearest tenths of inches, so as to be an aliquot of $60'$s, and what parts of a degree may be estimated by the vernier, it being divided into such equal parts, and containing such degrees as their columns show.\n\n| Rad. inches | Parts of a degree | Parts in vernier | Breadth of vernier | Parts observed |\n|------------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|\n| 3          | 1                | 15              | 1 5\u00bd               | 4' 0''        |\n| 6          | 1                | 20              | 20\u00bd                | 3' 0''        |\n| 9          | 2                | 20              | 10\u00bd                | 1' 30''       |\n| 12         | 2                | 24              | 12\u00bd                | 1' 15''       |\n| 15         | 3                | 20              | 6\u00bd                 | 1' 0''        |\n| 18         | 3                | 30              | 10\u00bd                | 0' 40''       |\n| 21         | 4                | 30              | 7\u00bd                 | 0' 30''       |\n| 24         | 4                | 36              | 9\u00bd                 | 0' 25''       |\n| 30         | 5                | 30              | 7\u00bd                 | 0' 20''       |\n| 36         | 6                | 30              | 5\u00bd                 | 0' 20''       |\n| 42         | 8                | 30              | 3\u00bd                 | 0' 15''       |\n| 48         | 9                | 40              | 4\u00bd                 | 0' 10''       |\n| 60         | 10               | 36              | 3\u00bd                 | 0' 10''       |\n| 72         | 12               | 30              | 2\u00bd                 | 0' 10''       |\n| 84         | 15               | 40              | 2\u00bd                 | 0' 6''        |\n| 96         | 15               | 60              | 4                  | 0' 4''        |\n\nBy altering the number of divisions, either in the degrees or in the vernier, or in both, an angle can be observed to a different degree of accuracy.

This mountain has two tops; one of which only goes by the name of Vesuvius, the other being now called Somma; but Sir William Hamilton is of opinion, that the latter is what the ancients called Vesuvius.\n\nThe perpendicular height of Vesuvius is only 3700 feet, though the ascent from the foot to the top is three Italian miles. One side of the mountain is well cultivated and fertile, producing great plenty of vines; but the south and west sides are entirely covered with cinders and ashes; while a sulphureous smoke constantly issues from the top, sometimes attended with the most violent explosions of stones, the emission of great streams of lava, and all the other attendants of a most formidable volcano. The first of these eruptions recorded in history took place in the year 79; at which time the two cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum were entirely buried under the stones and ashes thrown out. Incredible mischief was also done to the neighbouring country, and numbers of people lost their lives, among whom was Pliny the Elder.\n\nIt is the opinion of the best judges, however, that this eruption was by no means the first that had ever happened. The very streets of those cities which were at that time overwhelmed are said to be partly paved with lava. Since that time 30 different eruptions have been recorded, some of which have been extremely violent. In the year 1538, a mountain, three miles in circumference and a quarter of a mile in perpendicular height, was thrown up in the course of one night.\n\nThe first great eruption taken notice of by Sir William Hamilton was that of 1767, which, though very violent, was mild in comparison with that of 1538.\n\nFrom this time (1767) Vesuvius never ceased for ten years to send forth smoke, nor were there many months in which it did not throw out stones, scoriae, and cinders; which, increasing to a certain degree, were usually followed by lava; so that from the year 1767 to 1779 there were nine eruptions, some of them very considerable. In the month of August that year, however, an eruption took place, which, for its extraordinary and terrible appearance, may be reckoned among the most remarkable of any recorded concerning this or any other volcano.\n\nDuring the whole month of July the mountain continued in a state of fermentation. Subterraneous explosions and rumbling noises were heard; quantities of Vesuvian smoke were thrown up with great violence, sometimes with red-hot stones, scoriae, and ashes; and towards the end of the month these symptoms increased to such a degree as to exhibit, in the night-time, the most beautiful fireworks that can be imagined.\n\nOn Thursday 5th August the volcano appeared most violently agitated; a white and sulphureous smoke issued continually and impetuously from its crater, one puff seeming to impel another; so that a mass of them was soon accumulated, to appearance four times the height and size of the volcano itself. These clouds of smoke were exceedingly white, so that the whole resembled an immense accumulation of bales of the whitest cotton. In the midst of this very white smoke, vast quantities of stones, scoriae, and ashes, were thrown up to the height of 2000 feet; and a quantity of liquid lava, seemingly very heavy, was lifted up just high enough to clear the rim of the crater, and take its way down the sides of the mountains. This lava, having run violently for some hours, suddenly ceased, just before it had reached the cultivated parts of the mountain, near four miles from the spot whence it issued. The heat, all this day, was intolerable at the towns of Somma and Otaiano; and was sensibly felt at Palma and Lauri, which are much farther off. Reddish ashes fell so thick on the two former, that the air was darkened, and that objects could not be distinguished at the distance of ten feet. Long filaments of a vitrified matter, like spun glass, were mixed, and fell with these ashes; several birds in cages were suffocated, and the leaves of the trees in the neighbourhood of Somma were covered with white and very corrosive salt.\n\nAbout 12 at night, on the 7th, the fermentation of the mountain seemed greatly to increase. Our author, who was watching the motions of the volcano from the mole-fion of fire at Naples, which has a full view of it. Several picturesque effects had been observed from the approach of the deep red fire within the crater of Vesuvius-clouds, and which mounted high amongst those huge clouds on the top of it; when a summer storm, called in that country a *tropea*, came on suddenly, and blended its heavy watery clouds with the sulphureous and mineral ones, which were already like to many other mountains piled up on the top of the volcano. At this moment a fountain of fire was shot up to an incredible height, casting so bright a light, that the smallest objects were clearly distinguishable at any place within five miles or more of Vesuvius. The black stormy clouds, passing swiftly over, and at times covering the whole or a part of the bright column of fire, at other times clearing away and giving a full view of it, with the various tints produced by its reverberated light on the white clouds above in contrast with the pale flashes of forked lightning that attended the tropea, formed such a scene as no power of art can express. One of his Sicilian majesty's gamekeepers, who was out in the fields near Otaiano whilst this storm was at its height, was surprized to find the drops of rain scald his face and hands; a phenomenon probably occasioned by the clouds having acquired a great degree of heat in passing through the above-mentioned column of fire.\n\nOn the 8th, the mountain was quiet till towards six o'clock in the evening, when a great smoke began to gather over its crater; and about an hour after a rumbling\nblazing subterraneous noise was heard in the neighborhood of the volcano; the usual throws of red-hot stones and scoriae began and increased every instant. The crater, viewed through a telescope, seemed much enlarged by the violence of last night's explosions, and the little mountain on the top was entirely gone. About nine o'clock a most violent report was heard at Portici and its neighborhood, which shook the houses to such a degree as made the inhabitants run out into the streets. Many windows were broken, and walls cracked by the concussion of the air on this occasion, though the noise was but faintly heard at Naples. In an instant a fountain of liquid transparent fire began to rise, and gradually increasing, arrived at last at the amazing height of ten thousand feet and upwards. Puffs of smoke, as black as can possibly be imagined, succeeded another hastily, and accompanied the red-hot, transparent, and liquid lava, interrupting its splendid brightness here and there by patches of the darkest hue. Within these puffs of smoke, at the very moment of emission, a bright but pale electrical fire was observed playing briskly about in zig-zag lines. The wind was south-west, and, though gentle, was sufficient to carry these puffs of smoke out of the column of fire; and a collection of them by degrees formed a black and extensive curtain behind it; in other parts, of the sky it was perfectly clear, and the stars bright. The fiery fountain, of such immense magnitude, on the dark ground just mentioned, made the finest contrast imaginable; and the blaze of it reflected from the surface of the sea, which was at that time perfectly smooth, added greatly to this sublime view.\n\nThe lava, mixed with stones and scoriae, having risen to the amazing height already mentioned, was partly directed by the wind towards Otaiano, and partly falling, still red hot and liquid, upon the top of Vesuvius, covered its whole cone, part of that of the summit of Somma, and the valley between them. The falling matter, being nearly as inflamed and vivid as that which was continually issuing fresh from the crater, formed with it one complete body of fire, which could not be less than two miles and a half in breadth, and of the extraordinary height above mentioned, and cast a heat to the distance of at least five miles round. The breathwork on the mountain of Somma was soon in a blaze, and the flame of it being of a different colour from the deep red of the matter thrown out by the volcano, and from the silvery blue of the electrical fire, still added to the contrast of this most extraordinary scene.\n\nThe black cloud, increasing greatly, once bent towards Naples, and threatened the city with speedy destruction; for it was charged with electrical fire, which kept constantly darting about in bright zig-zag lines. This fire, however, rarely quitted the cloud, but usually returned to the great column of fire whence it proceeded; though once or twice it was seen to fall on the top of Somma, and set fire to some dry grass and bushes. Fortunately the wind carried back the cloud just as it reached the city, and had begun to occasion great alarm. The column of fire, however, still continued, and diffused such a strong light, that the most minute objects could be discerned at the distance of ten miles or more from the mountain. Mr Morris informed our author, that at Sorrento, which is 12 miles distant from Vesuvius, he read the title-page of a book by that volume Vesuvius.\n\nAll this time the miserable inhabitants of Otaiano and Distretti were involved in the utmost distress and danger by the inhabiting flowers of stones which fell upon them, and which, had they continued for a longer time, would most certainly have reduced their town to the same situation with Herculaneum and Pompeii. The mountain of Somma, at the foot of which the town of Otaiano is situated, hides Vesuvius from the view of its inhabitants; so that till the eruption became considerable it was not visible to them. On Sunday night, when the noise increased, and the fire began to appear above the mountain of Somma, many of the inhabitants flew to the churches, and others were preparing to quit the town, when a sudden and violent report was heard; soon after which they found themselves involved in a thick cloud of smoke and ashes; a horrid crashing noise was heard in the air, and presently fell a vast shower of stones and large pieces of scoriae, some of which were of the diameter of seven or eight feet, which must have weighed more than 1000 pounds before they were broken, as some of the fragments which Sir William Hamilton found in the streets still weighed upwards of 60 pounds. When these large vitrified masses either struck against one another in the air, or fell on the ground, they broke in many pieces, and covered a large space of ground with vivid sparks of fire, which communicated their heat to every thing that was combustible. These masses were formed of the liquid lava; the exterior parts of which were become black and porous by cooling in their fall through such a vast space; whilst the interior parts, less exposed, retained an extreme heat, and were perfectly red.\n\nIn an instant the town and country about it was on fire in many parts, for there were several straw huts in the vineyards, which had been erected for the watchmen of the grapes; all of which were burnt. A great magazine of wood in the heart of the town was all in a blaze; and had there been much wind, the flames must have spread universally, and all the inhabitants would have been burnt in their houses; for it was impossible for them to stir out. Some, who attempted it with pillows, tables, chairs, the tops of wine casks, &c., on their heads, were either knocked down or soon driven back to their close quarters under arches and in the cellars of their houses. Many were wounded, but only two persons died of their wounds.\n\nTo add to the horror of the scene, incessant volcanic lightning was whizzing about the black cloud that surrounded them, and the sulphureous smell and heat would scarcely allow them to draw their breath. In this dreadful situation they remained about 25 minutes, when the volcanic storm ceased all at once, and Vesuvius remained full of silence.\n\nSome time after the eruption had ceased, the air continued greatly impregnated with electrical matter. The Duke of Cottolengo told our author, that having, about thirty minutes after the great eruption had ceased, held after in the Leyden bottle, armed with a pointed wire, out at his window at Naples, it soon became considerably charged. But whilst the eruption was in force, its appearance was too alarming to allow one to think of such experiments. He was informed also by the prince of Monte Mileto,\nVesuvius. that his son, the duke of Popoli, who was at Monte Miletto the 8th of August, had been alarmed by the shower of cinders that fell there; some of which he had sent to Naples weighing two ounces; and that stones of an ounce weight had fallen upon an estate of his ten miles farther off. Monte Miletto is about 30 miles from the volcano. The abbe Caglioni also related, that his sister, a nun in a convent at Manfredonia, had written to inquire after him, imagining that Naples must have been destroyed, when they, at so great a distance, had been alarmed by a shower of ashes which fell on the city at 11 o'clock at night, so much as to open all the churches, and go to prayers. As the great eruption happened at nine o'clock, these ashes must have traveled 100 miles in the space of two hours.\n\nNothing could be more dismal than the appearance of Ottaiano after this eruption. The houses were unroofed, half buried under the black scoriae and ashes; all the windows towards the mountain were broken, and some of the houses themselves burnt; the streets choked up with ashes, in some narrow places not less than four feet thick; and a few of the inhabitants who had just returned, were employed in clearing them away, and piling them up in hillocks, to get at their ruined houses. The palace of the prince of Ottaiano is situated on an eminence above the town, and nearer the mountain. The steps leading up to it were deeply covered with volcanic matter; the roof was totally destroyed, and the windows broken, but the house itself, being strongly built, had not suffered much.\n\nAn incredible number of fragments of lava were thrown out during the eruption, some of which were of immense magnitude. The largest measured by Sir William Hamilton was 108 feet in circumference and 17 in height. This was thrown at least a quarter of a mile clear of the mouth of the volcano. Another, 66 feet in circumference and 19 in height, being nearly of a spherical figure, was thrown out at the same time, and lay near the former. This last had the marks of being rounded, nay almost polished, by continual rolling in torrents or on the sea-shore. Our author conjectures that it might be a spherical volcanic salt, such as that of 45 feet in circumference mentioned by M. de St Fond, in his Treatise of Extinguished Volcanoes. A third of 16 feet in height and 92 in circumference was thrown much farther, and lay in the valley between Vesuvius and the Hermitage. It appeared also, from the large fragments that surrounded this mass, that it had been much larger while in the air.\n\nVesuvius continued to emit smoke for a considerable time after this great eruption, so that our author was apprehensive that another would soon ensue; but from that time nothing comparable to the above has taken place. From the time of this great eruption to the year 1784 our author kept an exact diary of the operations of Vesuvius, with drawings, showing, by the quantity of smoke, the degree of fermentation within the volcano. The operations of the subterraneous fire, however, appear to be very capricious and uncertain. One day there is the appearance of a violent fermentation, and the next every thing is tranquil; but whenever there has been a considerable ejection of scoriae and cinders, it has been a constant observation, that the lava soon made its appearance, either by boiling over the crater, or forcing its way through the crevices in the conical part of the mountain. An eruption took place in the month of November 1784, and continued for some time, but without any remarkable circumstance.\n\nVetch. See Vicia.

Having distinguished himself by his learning and taste for literature, he was made bishop of Alva in 1552. After continuing two years with Pope Clement VII. at Rome, he went to reside upon his fee; where, for 30 years, he performed all the offices of a good bishop and a good man; and though he was mild, gentle, and full of goodness, he was far from wanting spirit, that when the city of Alva was besieged by the French, he used all possible means to prevent its being given up, by strenuously exhorting the people, and, when provisions were scarce, by supplying them at his own expense. His Poetics, and poem on the silk-worm, pass for his masterpiece; his poem on the game of chess is also greatly admired.

The city itself is not of very great extent; nor can it be enlarged, it being limited by a very strong fortification; but it is very populous. The streets, in general, are narrow, and the houses built high. Some of the public buildings are magnificent; but they appear externally to no great advantage, on account of the narrowness of the streets. The chief of them are the imperial palace, the library, and the museum; the palaces of the princes Lichtenstein, Eugene, &c. Vienna was twice ineffectually besieged by the Turks; namely, in 1589 and 1683. At the latter period, the siege was raised by John Sobieski, king of Poland, who totally defeated the Turkish army before the walls of this place. There is no great danger that Vienna will ever again be subjected to the inconveniences of a siege. Yet, in case that should happen, a measure has been taken, which will prevent the necessity of destroying the suburbs; namely, no houses without the walls are allowed to be built nearer to the glacis than 600 yards; so that there is a circular field of that breadth all round the town, which, exclusive of the advantage above-mentioned, has a very beautiful and salutary effect. These magnificent suburbs, and the town together, are said to contain above 300,000 inhabitants; yet the former are not near so populous, in proportion to their size, as the town; because many houses in the suburbs have extensive gardens belonging to them, and many families, who live during the winter within the fortifications, spend the summer in the suburbs. The cathedral is built of free-stone, is 114 yards long, and 48 broad, and the steeple is 447 feet high. Instead of a weathercock there was a Turkish crescent, in memory of the siege in 1589; but, after the second siege in 1683, it was changed for a golden cross, which three months after was thrown down by a storm. At present there is a black spread eagle, over which is a gilded cross. Joining to this church is the archbishop's palace, the front of which is very fine. The university had several thousand students, who, when this city was besieged, mounted guard, as they did also in 1741. Beside this, there is the academy of Lower Austria; and the archducal library is much frequented by foreigners, as it contains above 100,000 printed books, and 10,000 manuscripts. The academy of painting is remarkable for the fine pictures it produces. The archducal treasury, and a cabinet of curiosities of the house of Austria, are great rarities. The inhabitants, in general, live in a splendid manner; and people of distinction have all sorts of wines at their tables, which they are very free with to foreigners. There is a port of harbour on the Danube, where there are magazines of naval stores, and ships have been fitted out to serve on that river against the Turks. Vienna is an archbishop's see. It is seated at the place where the river Vienna or Wein, falls into the Danube, 30 miles west of Presburgh, 350 north-north-east of Rome, 520 south-east by south of Amsterdam, 565 east of Paris, and 680 east-south-east of London.

Some open in the morning, as the lip flowers, and compound flowers with flat spreading petals; others at noon, as the mallows; and a third set in the evening, or after sunset, as some geraniums and opuntias: the hour of shutting is equally determined. Of those which open in the morning, some shut soon after, while others remain expanded till night.\n\nThe hours of opening, like the time of flowering, seem to vary, according to the species of the plant, the temperature of the climate, and that of the season. Flowers, whose extreme delicacy would be hurt by the strong impressions of an ardent sun, do not open till night; those which require a moderate degree of heat to elevate their juices; in other words, whose juices do not rise but in\nthe morning or evening, do not expand till then; whilst those which need a more lively heat for the same purpose, expand at noon, when the sun is in his meridian strength. Hence it is, that the heat of the air being greater between the tropics than elsewhere, plants which are transported from those climates into the cold or temperate climates of Europe, expand their flowers much later than in their native soil. Thus, a flower which opens in summer at six o'clock in the morning at Senegal, will not open at the same season in France and England till eight or nine, nor in Sweden till ten.\n\nLinnaeus distinguishes by the general name of solar (flores solares) all those flowers which observe a determinate time in opening and shutting. These flowers are again divided, from certain circumstances, into three species, or kinds:\n\nEquinoctial flowers (flores aquinoctiales) are such as open and shut at all seasons, at a certain fixed or determinate hour.\n\nTropical flowers (flores tropici) are such whose hour of opening is not fixed at all seasons, but accelerated or retarded according as the length of the day is increased or diminished.\n\nMeteorous flowers (flores meteorici) are such whose hour of expansion depends upon the dry or humid state of the air, and the greater or less pressure of the atmosphere. Of this kind is the Siberian fox-thistle, which shuts at night if the ensuing day is to be clear and serene, and opens if it is to be cloudy and rainy. In like manner the African marigold, which in dry serene weather opens at six or seven in the morning, and shuts at four o'clock in the afternoon, is a sure indication that rain will fall during the course of the day, when it continues shut after seven.","sp":187,"ep":188},{"h":"VIGO","t":"a sea port town of Galicia in Spain, with an old castle and a fort.

The folk-land or estates held in villenage, was a species of tenure neither strictly feudal, Norman, or Saxon; but mixed and compounded of them all; and which also, on account of the heriots Villenage, that usually attend it, may seem to have somewhat Danish in its composition. Under the Saxon government there were, as Sir William Temple speaks, a sort of people in a condition of downright servitude, used and employed in the most servile works, and belonging, both they, their children, and effects, to the lord of the soil, like the rest of the cattle or stock upon it. They seem to have been those who held what was called the folk-land, from which they were removable at the lord's pleasure. On the arrival of the Normans here, it seems not improbable, that they, who were strangers to any other than a feudal state, might give some sparks of enfranchisement to such wretched persons as fell to their share, by admitting them, as well as others, to the oath of fealty; which conferred a right of protection, and raised the tenant to a kind of estate superior to downright slavery, but inferior to every other condition. This they called villenage, and the tenants villeins.\n\nThese villeins, belonging principally to lords of manors, were either villeins regardant, that is, annexed to the manor or land; or else they were in gross, or at large, that is, annexed to the person of the lord, and transferable by deed from one owner to another. They could not leave their lord without his permission; but, if they ran away, or were purloined from him, might be claimed and recovered by action, like beasts or other chattels. They held indeed small portions of land by way of sustaining themselves and families; but it was at the mere will of the lord, who might disfranchise them whenever he pleased; and it was upon villain services, that is, to carry out dungs, to hedge and ditch the lord's demesnes, and any other the meanest offices; and their services were not only base, but uncertain both as to their time and quantity.\n\nA villain could acquire no property either in lands or goods; if he purchased either, the lord might seize them to his own use; unless he contrived to disfranchise them again before the lord had seized them, for the lord had then lost his opportunity.\n\nIn many places also a fine was payable to the lord, if the villain presumed to marry his daughter to any one with leave from the lord; and, by the common law, the lord might also bring an action against the husband for damages in thus purloining his property. For the children of villeins were also in the same state of bondage with their parents; whence they were called in Latin nativi, which gave rise to the female appellation of a villein, who was called a neife. In case of a marriage between a freeman and a neife, or a villein and a free-woman, the issue followed the condition of the father, being free if he was free, and a villein if he was villein, contrary to the maxim of the civil law, that partus sequitur ventrem. But no bastard could be born a villein, because by another maxim of our law he is nullius filius; and as he can gain nothing by inheritance, it were hard that he should lose his natural freedom by it. The law, however, protected the persons of villeins against atrocious injuries of the lord: for he might not kill or maim his villein; though he might beat him with impunity.\n\nVilleins might be enfranchised by manumission. In process of time they gained considerable ground on their lords; and in particular strengthened the tenure of their estates to that degree, that they came to have in them an interest in many places full as good, in others better than\nVillenage, than their lords. For the good nature and benevolence of many lords of manors having, time out of mind, permitted their villeins and their children to enjoy their possessions without interruption, in a regular course of descent, the common law, of which custom is the life, now gave them title to prescribe against their lords; and, on performance of the same services, to hold their lands, in spite of any determination of the lord's will. For though in general they are still said to hold their estates at the will of the lord, yet it is such a will as is agreeable to the custom of the manor; which customs are preserved and evidenced by the rolls of the several courts-baron in which they are entered, or kept on foot by the constant immemorial usage of the several manors in which the lands lie. And as such tenants had nothing to show for their estates but those customs, and admissions in pursuance of them, entered on these rolls, or the copies of such entries witnessed by the steward, they now began to be called tenants by copy of court-roll, and their tenure itself a copyhold.\n\nPrivileged Villenage, a species of tenure otherwise called villein-seignory. See Tenure.\n\nAncient demesne consists of those lands or manors which, though now perhaps granted out to private subjects, were actually in the hands of the crown in the time of Edward the Confessor, or William the Conqueror; and so appear to have been, by the great survey in the exchequer, called the Domesday-book. The tenants of these lands, under the crown, were not all of the same order or degree. Some of them, as Britton testifies, continued for a long time pure and absolute villeins, dependent on the will of the lord; and common copyholders in only a few points. Others were in a great measure enfranchised by the royal favour; being only bound in respect of their lands to perform some of the better sort of villein-services, but those determinate and certain; as, to plough the king's land for so many days; to supply his court with such a quantity of provisions; and the like; all of which are now changed into pecuniary rents; and in consideration hereof they had many immunities and privileges granted to them; as, to try the right of their property in a peculiar court of their own, called a court of ancient demesne, by a peculiar process denominated a writ of right close; not to pay toll or taxes; not to contribute to the expenses of knights of the shire; not to be put on juries, and the like.\n\nThese tenants therefore, though their tenure be absolutely copyhold, yet have an interest equivalent to a freehold: for though their services were of a base and villainous original, yet the tenants were esteemed in all others respects to be highly privileged villeins; and especially for that their services were fixed and determinate, and that they could not be compelled (like pure villeins) to relinquish those tenements at the lord's will, or to hold them against their own: et idem (says Bracton) dieuntur liberi.\n\nLands holding by this tenure are therefore a species of copyhold, and as such preserved and exempted from the operation of the statute of Charles II. Yet they differ from common copyholds, principally in the privileges before mentioned: as also they differ from freeholders by one especial mark and tincture of villenage, noted by Bracton, and remaining to this day; viz. that they cannot be conveyed from man to man by the general common-law conveyances of seffoment, and the rest; but must pass by surrender to the lord or his steward, in the manner of common copyholds: yet with the difference, that, in the surrenders of these lands in ancient demesne, it is not used to say, \"to hold at the will of their lord,\" in their copies; but only, \"to hold according to the custom of the manor.\"","sp":188,"ep":189},{"h":"VILLI","t":"among botanists, a kind of down like short hair, with which lyme trees abound.","sp":189,"ep":189},{"h":"VILLOSE","t":"or VILLOUS, something abounding with villi or fibres like short hair; such is one of the coats of the stomack.","sp":189,"ep":189},{"h":"VINCA","t":"a genus of plants of the clas pentandra; and in the natural system arranged under the 30th order, Conortae.

It is inhabited by a race of people, of whom Dr Robertson gives this account: \"There is a great distinction in character between the Caribbees and the inhabitants of the larger islands. The former appear manifestly to be a separate race. Their language is totally different from that of their neighbours in the large islands. They themselves have a tradition that their ancestors came originally from some part of the continent, and having conquered and exterminated the ancient inhabitants, took possession of their lands and of their women. Hence they call themselves Banaree, which signifies a man come from beyond sea. Accordingly, the Caribbees still use two distinct languages, one peculiar to the men, and the other to the women. The language of the men has nothing common with that spoken in the large islands. The dialect of the women considerably resembles it. This strongly confirms the tradition which I have mentioned. The Caribbees themselves imagine that they were a colony from the Galibis, a powerful nation of Guiana in South America. But as their fierce manners approach nearer to those of the people in the northern continent, than to those of the natives of South America, and as their language has likewise some affinity to that spoken in Florida, their origin should be deduced rather from the former than from the latter. In their wars they still preserve their ancient practice of destroying all the males, and preserving the women either for servitude or for breeding.\"\n\nIt remained a long time after it was discovered inhabited by these people, and by another race improperly styled Black Caribs, who are in reality negroes descended, as is generally believed, from some who escaped out of a Guinea ship wrecked upon the coast, and gradually augmented by such as from time to time fled thither from Barbadoes. These nations were often at war; but when their quarrels were composed, they had a strength sufficient to prevent strangers from settling by force. The French, about half a century ago, at the request of the Caribs, made a descent from Martinico, and attacked the negroes, but were repulsed with loss; and found it their interest to conciliate a friendship with both nations by means of presents, and furnishing them with arms and ammunition.\n\nSt Vincent was long a neutral island; but, at the peace of 1763, the French agreed that the right to it should be vested in the English; who, in the sequel, at the instance of some rapacious planters, engaged in an unjust war against the Caribbees, who inhabited the windward\nSt Vincent, windward side of the island, and who were obliged to content to a peace, by which they ceded a very large tract of valuable land to the crown. The consequence of this was, that in the next war, in 1779, they greatly contributed to the reduction of this island by the French, who, however, restored it by the peace of 1783. Since that time it has continued in the possession of Great Britain. During the French revolutionary war, the Caribs revolted; and, assisted by the French, spread devastation over the whole island; but by the exertions of the governor and the British forces in the West Indies, the revolt was quelled.\n\nSt Vincent is in length about 24 miles, and about 18 in breadth. The climate is very warm. The country is in generally hilly, in some places mountainous; but interspersed with a variety of pleasant valleys, and some luxuriant plains, the soil being everywhere very fertile, and the high grounds are at least in general easy of ascent. Few islands are so well watered with rivers and springs. The inhabitants raise all kinds of ground provisions in plenty. The rivers supply them with variety of fish. W. Long, 61\u00b0 N.

He was placed under Andrea Verrocchio, a celebrated painter in that city; but soon surpassed him and all his predecessors so much, as to be reputed the master of the third or golden age of modern painting. But his studies were far from terminating here; no man's genius was more universal: he applied himself to arts, to literature, and to the accomplishments of the body; and he excelled in every thing which he attempted. Lewis Sforza duke of Milan prevailed on him to be director of the academy for architecture he had just established; where Leonardo soon banished all the Gothic fashions, and reduced every thing to the happy simplicity of the Greek and Roman style. By the duke's order he constructed the famous aqueduct that supplies the city of Milan with water: this canal goes by the name of Morteiana, being above 200 miles in length, and conducts the water of the river Adda quite to the walls of the city. In 1479, he was desired to construct some new device for the entertainment of Louis XII. of France, who was then to make his entrance into Milan. Leonardo accordingly made a very curious automaton in the form of a lion, which marched out to meet the king, reared up on its hinder legs before him, and opening its breast, displayed an escutcheon with fleurs de lys quartered on it. The disorders of Lombardy, with the misfortunes of his patrons the Sforzi, obliging Leonardo to quit Milan, he retired to Florence, where he flourished under the Medici: here he raised the envy of Michael Angelo, who was his contemporary; and Raphael, from the study of his works, acquired his best manner of designing. At length, on the invitation of Francis I., he removed to France when above 70 years of age; where the journey and change of climate threw him into his last sickness: he languished for some months at Fontainebleau, where the king came frequently to see him; and one day rising up in his bed to acknowledge the honour done him, he fainted, and Francis supporting him, Leonardo died in his arms. His death happened in 1520. Some of his paintings are to be seen in England and other countries, but the greatest part of them are in Florence and France.

He studied first at Mantua; then at Cremona, Milan, and Naples; whence going to Rome, he acquired the esteem of the greatest wits and most illustrious persons of his time; and among others of the emperor Augustus, Mecenas, and Pollio. He was well skilled not only in polite literature and poetry, but also in philosophy,\nVirgil, the mathematics, geography, medicine, and natural history. Though one of the greatest geniuses of his age, and the admiration of the Romans, he always preferred a singular mode, and lived chastely at a time when the manners of the people were extremely corrupt. He carried Latin poetry to such an high perfection, that he was justly esteemed the prince of Latin poets. He first turned himself to pastoral; and being captivated with the beauty and sweetness of Theocritus, was ambitious to introduce this new species of poetry among the Romans. His first performance in this way supposed to have been written U. C. 907, the year before the death of Julius Caesar, when the poet was in his 25th year: it is intitled Alexis. Possibly Palaeemon was his second: it is a close imitation of the fourth and fifth Idylls of Theocritus. Mr Wharton places Silenus next; which is said to have been publicly recited on the stage by Cytheris, a celebrated comedian. Virgil's fifth eclogue is composed in allusion to the death and deification of Caesar. The battle of Philippi in 712 having put an end to the Roman liberty, the veteran soldiers began to murmur for their pay; and Augustus, to reward them, distributed among them the lands of Mantua and Cremona. Virgil was involved in this common calamity; and applied to Varus and Pollio, who warmly recommended him to Augustus, and procured for him his patrimony again. Full of gratitude to Augustus, he composed the Thyrsus, in which he introduces two shepherds; one of them complaining of the distraction of the times, and of the havoc the soldiers made among the Mantuan farmers; the other rejoicing for the recovery of his estate, and promising to honour as a god the person who restored it to him. But our poet's joy was not of long continuance; for we are told, that when he returned to take possession of his farm, he was violently assaulted by the intruder, and would certainly have been killed by him if he had not escaped by swimming hastily over the Mincio. Upon this unexpected disappointment, he returned to Rome to renew his petition; and during his journey seems to have composed his ninth eclogue. The celebrated eclogue, intitled Pollio, was composed U. C. 714, upon the following occasion: The confid Pollio on the part of Antony, and Macenas on the part of Caesar, had made up the differences between them; by agreeing, that Octavia, half-sister to Caesar, should be given in marriage to Antony. This agreement caused an universal joy; and Virgil, in his eclogue, testified his. Octavia was with child by her late husband Marcellus at the time of this marriage; and whereas the Sibylline oracles had foretold, that a child was to be born about this time, who should rule the world, and establish perpetual peace, the poet ingeniously supposes the child in Octavia's womb to be the glorious infant, under whose reign mankind was to be happy, the golden age to return from heaven, and fraud and violence to be no more. In this celebrated poem, the author, with great delicacy at the same time, pays his court to both the chiefs, to his patron Pollio, to Octavia, and to the unborn infant. In 715, Pollio was sent against the Parthians, a people of Illyricum; and during this expedition, Virgil addressed to him a beautiful eclogue, called Pharsacneutria. His tenth and last eclogue was addressed to Gallus.\n\nIn his 34th year, he retired to Naples, and laid the plan of his Georgics; which he undertook at the intreates of Maecenas, to whom he dedicated them. This wife and able minister resolved, if possible, to revive the decayed spirit of husbandry; to introduce a taste for agriculture, even among the great; and could not think of a better method to effect this, than to recommend it by the infatuating charms of poetry. Virgil fully answered the expectations of his patron by his Georgics. They are divided into four books. Corn and ploughing are the subject of the first, vines of the second, cattle of the third, and bees of the fourth.\n\nHe is supposed to have been in his 45th year when he began to write the Aeneid; the design of which was to reconcile the Romans to the government of Augustus. Augustus was eager to peruse this poem before it was finished; and intreated him by letters to communicate it. Macrobius has preserved to us part of one of Virgil's answers to the emperor, in which the poet excuses himself: who, however, at length complied, and read himself the sixth book to the emperor; when Octavia, who had just lost her son Marcellus, the darling of Rome, and adopted son of Augustus, made one of the audience. \"Virgil had artfully interlaid that beautiful lamentation for the death of young Marcellus, beginning with\u2014O nate, ingentem luculum ne quere tuorum\u2014but suppressed his name till he came to the line\u2014Tu Marcellus eris: upon hearing which, Octavia could bear no more, but fainted away, overcome with surprize and sorrow. When she recovered, she made the poet a present of ten sestertii for every line, which amounted in the whole to above 2000L.\n\nThe Aeneid being brought to a conclusion, but not to the perfection our author intended to give it, he resolved to travel into Greece, to correct and polish it at leisure. It was probably on this occasion that Horace addressed that affectionate ode to him, Sic te Divo potens Cypri, &c. Augustus returning victorious from the east, met with Virgil at Athens, who thought himself obliged to attend the emperor to Italy; but the poet was suddenly seized with a fatal distemper, which being increased by the agitation of the vessel, put an end to his life as soon as he landed at Brundusium, in his 52d year. He had ordered in his will, that the Aeneid should be burnt as an unfinished poem; but Augustus forbade it, and had it delivered to Varius and Tucca, with the strictest charge to make no additions, but only to publish it correctly. He died with such steadiness and tranquillity, as to be able to dictate his own epitaph in the following words:\n\nMantua me genuit: Calabri rapuere, tenet nunc\nParthenope: cecini Pafcua, Rara, Duces.\n\nHis bones were carried to Naples, according to his earnest request; and a monument was erected at a small distance from the city.\n\nVirgil was of a lankish complexion, tall, of a sickly constitution, and afflicted with frequent headaches and spitting of blood. He was so very bashful, that he often ran into the shops to prevent being gazed at in the streets; yet was so honoured by the Roman people, that once coming into the theatre, the whole audience rose up out of respect to him. He was of a thoughtful and melancholy temper; he spoke little, and loved retirement and contemplation. His fortune was affluent; he had a fine house and well furnished library near Maecenas's gardens, on the Esquiline mount at Rome, and al-\nso a delightful villa in Sicily. He was so benevolent and inoffensive, that most of his contemporary poets, though they envied each other, agreed in loving and esteeming him. He revised his verses with prodigious fervency; and used to compare himself to a she bear, which licked her cubs into shape.\n\nThe best edition of Virgil's works are those of Mof- vicus, with the notes of Servius, printed at Leiden in 1717, two vols 4to; and that of Burman, at Amsterdam, 1746, in four vols 4to. There are several English translations, which are well known.\n\nVirgil, Polydore, an English historian, born at Urbino in Italy, was sent in the beginning of the 16th century, by Pope Alexander VI, as sub-collector of the Papal tax, called Peter-pence, in this kingdom. He had not been long in England before he obtained preferment in the church; for in 1503 he was presented to the rectory of Church-Langton in the archdeaconry of Leicester. In 1507 he was collated to the prebend of Scamlerby in the church of Lincoln; and in the same year was made archdeacon of Wells, and prebendary of Hereford. In 1513, he resigned his prebend of Lincoln, and was collated to that of Osgate in St Paul's, London. We are told, that on his preferment to the archdeaconry of Wells, he resigned the office of sub-collector to the pope, and determined to spend the remainder of his life in England, the History of which kingdom he began in the year 1505, at the command of Henry VII. That work cost him 12 years labour. In 1526, he finished his treatise on Prodigies. Polydore continued in England during the whole reign of Henry VIII, and part of that of Edward VI, whence it is concluded that he was a moderate Papist. In 1550, being now an old man, he requested leave to revisit his native country. He was accordingly dismissed with a present of 300 crowns, together with the privilege of holding his preferments to the end of his life. He died at Urbino in the year 1555. As an historian, he is accused by some as a malignant flatterer of the English nation; yet Jovius remarks, that the French and Scotch accuse him of having flattered that nation too much: (See his Elog. cap. 135. p. 179.)

This state is therefore one third larger than the islands of Great Britain and Ireland, which are reckoned at 88,357 square miles.\n\nThe principal rivers in Virginia are, Roanoke, James river, which receives the Rivanna, Appamattox, Chicahominy, Nansemond, and Elizabeth rivers; York river, which is formed by the junction of Pamunky and Mattaponi rivers; Rappahannock, and Potomack.\n\nThe mountains are not solitary and scattered confusedly over the face of the country; they commence at about 150 miles from the sea coast, and are disposed in ridges one behind another, running nearly parallel with the coast, though rather approaching it as they advance north-eastwardly. To the south-west, as the tract of country between the sea-coast and the Mississippi becomes narrower, the mountains converge into a single ridge, which, as it approaches the gulf of Mexico, subsides into plain country, and gives rise to some of the waters of that gulf.\n\nFrom the great extent of Virginia, it may be expected that the climate is not the same in all its parts. It is remarkable that, proceeding on the same parallel of latitude westwardly, the climate becomes colder in like manner as when you proceed northwardly. This continues to be the case till you attain the summit of the Alleghany, which is the highest land between the ocean and the Mississippi. From thence, descending in the same latitude to the Mississippi, the change reverses; and, if we may believe travellers, it becomes warmer there than it is in the same latitude on the sea side. Their testimony is strengthened by the vegetables and animals which subsist and multiply there naturally, and do not on the sea-coast. Thus catalpas grow spontaneously on the Mississippi as far as the latitude of 37\u00b0, and reeds as far as 38\u00b0 degrees. Perroquets even winter on the Soto in the 39th degree of latitude. In the summer of 1779, when the thermometer was at 90 degrees at Monticello, and 96 degrees at Williamsburg, it was 110 degrees at Kalkaska. Perhaps the mountain, which overhangs this village on the north side, may by its reflection have contributed somewhat to produce this heat.\n\nThe number of free inhabitants in this state in 1790 was 454,983, and of slaves 292,627. The whole imports of the state of Virginia amounted in 1796 to 5,268,615 dollars.\n\nThe college of William and Mary is the only public seminary of learning in Virginia. It was founded in the time of King William and Queen Mary, who granted it to 20,000 acres of land, and a penny a pound duty on certain tobaccos exported from Virginia and Maryland. The assembly also gave it by temporary law a duty on liquors imported, and skins and furs exported. From these resources it received upwards of 3000l. communiens annis. The buildings are of brick, sufficient for an indifferent accommodation of perhaps 100 students. By its charter it was to be under the government of 20 visitors, who were to be its legislators; and to have a president and six professorships, which at present stand thus.\u2014A professorship for Law and Police; Anatomy and Medicine; Natural Philosophy and Mathematics; Moral Philosophy, the Law of Nature and Nations, the Fine Arts; Modern Languages; and a fifth, called the professorship of Brafferton, for the instruction of the Indians. In 1787, there were about 30 young gentlemen members of this college, a large proportion of which were law students. There are some flourishing academies in Virginia; one in Prince Edward county, one at Alexandria, one at Norfolk, one at Hanover, and others in other places.\n\nThe present denominations of Christians in Virginia are Presbyterians, who are the most numerous, and in-\nhabit the western parts of the state; Episcopalians, who are the most ancient settlers, and occupy the eastern and first settled parts of the state. Intermingled with these are great numbers of Baptists and Methodists. The bulk of these last mentioned religious sects are of the poorer sort of people, and many of them are very ignorant (as is indeed the case with the other denominations), but they are generally a virtuous well-meaning set of people.\n\nVirginia has produced some of the most distinguished men that have been active in effecting the two late important revolutions in America, whose political and military character will rank among the first in the pages of history. The great body of the people do not concern themselves with politics; so that their government, though nominally republican, is in fact oligarchical or aristocratical. The Virginians who are rich, are in general sensible, polite, and hospitable, and of an independent spirit. The poor are ignorant and abject; all are of an inquisitive turn, and in many other respects very much resemble the people in the eastern states. There is a much greater disparity between the rich and the poor in Virginia than in any of the northern states. A spirit for literary inquiries, if not altogether confined to a few, is, among the body of the people, evidently subordinate to a spirit of gaming and barbarous sports. At almost every tavern or ordinary on the public road there is a billiard table, a backgammon table, cards, and other implements for various games. To these public houses the gambling gentry in the neighborhood resort to kill time which hangs heavily upon them; and at these businesses they are extremely expert, having been accustomed to it from their earliest youth. The passion for cock-fighting, a diversion not only inhumanly barbarous, but infinitely beneath the dignity of a man of sense, is so predominant, that they even advertise their matches in the public newspapers.\n\nThe executive powers are lodged in the hands of a governor chosen annually, and incapable of acting more than three years in seven. He is assisted by a council of eight members. The judiciary powers are divided among several courts. Legislation is exercised by two houses of assembly; one called the House of Delegates, composed of two members from each county, chosen annually by the citizens possessing an estate for life in 100 acres of uninhabited land, or 25 acres with a house on it, or in a house or lot in town. The other called the Senate, consisting of 24 members, chosen quadrennially by the same electors, who for this purpose are distributed into 24 districts. The concurrence of both houses is necessary to the passage of a law. They have the appointment of the governor and council, the judges of the superior courts, auditors, attorney-general, treasurer, register of the land office, and delegates to Congress.\n\nBefore the war, there was exported from this state, communibus annis, to the amount of 850,000l. Virginia money, or 697,142 guineas.\n\nThe whole country before it was planted was one continued forest interspersed with marshes. No country now produces greater quantities of excellent tobacco; and the soil is generally so sandy and shallow, that after they have cleared a fresh piece of ground out of the woods, it will not bear tobacco after two or three years unless well manured. The forests yield oaks, poplars, pines, cedars, cypresses, sweet myrtles, chestnuts, hickory, live oak, walnut, dogwood, alder, hazel, chinquapins, locust-trees, salalfras, elm, ash, beech, with a great variety of sweet gums and incense, which distill from several trees; pitch, tar, rosin, turpentine, plank timber, masts, and yards. Virginia yields also rice, hemp, Indian corn, plenty of pasture, with coal, quarries of stone, and lead and iron ore.","sp":192,"ep":193},{"h":"VIRGO","t":"in Astronomy, one of the signs or constellations of the zodiac.","sp":193,"ep":193},{"h":"VIRGULA DIVINATORIA","t":"divining rod.

His father, Francis Arquet, was ancien notaire au Chatelet, and treasurer of the chamber of accounts; his mother, Mary-Margaret Draumart. At the birth of this extraordinary man, who lived to the age of 85 years and some months, there was little probability of his being reared, and for a considerable time he continued remarkably feeble. In his earliest years he displayed a ready wit and a sprightly imagination; and, as he said of himself made verses before he was out of his cradle. He was educated, under Father Por\u00e9, in the college of Louis the Great; and such was his proficiency, that many of his essays are now existing, which, though written when he was between 12 and 14, show no marks of infancy. The famous Ninon de l'Enclos, to whom this ingenious boy was introduced, left him a legacy of 2000 livres to buy him a library. Having been sent to the equity schools on quitting college, he was so disgusted with the dryness of the law, that he devoted himself entirely to the muses. He was admitted into the company of the abbe Cheauleu, the marquis de la Fare, the duke de Sully, the grand prior of Vendome, marshal Villars, and the chevalier du Bouillon; and caught from them that easy taste and delicate humour which distinguished the court of Louis XIV. Voltaire had early imbibed a turn for satire; and, for some philippics against the government, was imprisoned almost a year in the Bastille. He had before this period produced the tragedy of Oedipus, which was represented in 1718 with great success; and the duke of Orleans happening to see it performed, was so delighted, that he obtained his release from prison. The poet waiting on the duke to return thanks; \"Be wise (said the duke), and I will take care of you.\" \"I am infinitely obliged (replied the young man); but I intreat your royal highness not to trouble yourself any farther about my lodging or board.\"\n\nHe began his Henriade before he was 18. Having one day read several cantos of this poem when on a visit to his intimate friend, the young president de Maifons, he was so teased with objections, that he lost patience, and threw his manuscript into the fire. The president Henaut with difficulty rescued it. \"Remember (said Mr Henaut to him, in one of his letters) it was I that saved the Henriade, and that it cost me a handsome pair of ruffles.\" Some years after, several copies of this poem having got abroad, while it was only a sketch, an edition of it was published, with many charms, under the title of The League. Instead of fame and friends, the author gained only enemies and mortification, by this first edition. The bigots took fire at it, and the poet was considered as highly criminal for praising Admiral Coligny and Queen Elizabeth. Endeavours were even used to get the piece suppressed; but this strange design proved abortive. His chagrin, on this occasion, first inspired him with the thought of visiting England, in order to finish the work, and republish it in a land of liberty. He was right; for King George I, and more particularly the princess of Wales, afterwards queen of England, raised an immense subscription for him. Their liberality laid the foundation of his fortune; for on his return to France in 1728, he put his money into a lottery established by M. Desfortes, comptroller-general of the finances. The adventurers received a rent charge on the Hotel-de-Ville for their tickets; and the prizes were paid in ready money; so that if a society had taken all the tickets, it would have gained a million of livres. He joined with a numerous company of adventurers, and was fortunate.\n\nHis Lettres Philosophiques, abounding in bold expressions and indecent witticisms against religion, having been burnt by a decree of the parliament of Paris, and a warrant being issued for apprehending the author in 1733, Voltaire prudently withdrew; and was sheltered by the marchioness du Chatelet, in her castle of Cirey, on the borders of Champagne and Lorraine, who entered with him on the study of the system of Leibnitz, and the Principia of Newton. A gallery was built, in which Voltaire formed a good collection of natural history, and made an infinite number of experiments on light and electricity. He laboured in the mean time on his Elements of the Newtonian Philosophy, then totally unknown in France, and which the numerous admirers of Descartes were little desirous should be known. In the midst of these philosophic pursuits he produced the tragedy of Alzira. He was now in the meridian of his age and genius, as was evident from the tragedy of Mahomet, first acted in 1741; but it was represented to the procureur-general as a performance offensive to religion; and the author, by order of Cardinal Fleury, withdrew it from the stage. Merope, played two years after, 1743, gave an idea of a species of tragedy, of which few models had existed. It was at the representation of this tragedy, that the pit and boxes were clamorous for a sight of the author; yet it was severely criticised when it came from the press. He now became a favourite at court, through the interest of Madame d'Epinay, afterwards marchioness of Pompadour. He was appointed a gentleman of the bed-chamber in ordinary, and historiographer of France. He had frequently attempted to gain admittance into the Academy of Sciences, but could not obtain his wish till 1746, when he was the first who broke through the absurd custom of filling an inaugural speech with the fulsome adulation of Richelieu; an example soon followed by other academicians. From the satires occasioned by this innovation he felt so much uneasiness, that he was glad to retire with the marchioness du Chatelet to Lunville, in the neighbourhood of King Stanislaus. The marchioness dying in 1749, Voltaire returned to Paris, where his stay was but short. The king of Prussia now gave Voltaire an invitation to live with him, which he accepted towards the end of August.\nVoltaire. gust 1753. On his arrival at Berlin, he was immediately presented with the Order of Merit, the key of chamberlain, and a pension of 20,000 livres. From the particular respect that was paid to him, his time was now spent in the most agreeable manner; his apartments were under those of the king, whom he was allowed to visit at stated hours, to read with him the best works of either ancient or modern authors, and to assist his majesty in the literary productions by which he relieved the cares of government. But a dispute which arose between him and Maupeutus soon brought on his disgrace. Maupeutus was at some pains to have it reported at court, that one day while General Maintenue happened to be in the apartments of M. de Voltaire, who was then translating into French the Memoirs of Russia, composed by that officer, the king, in his usual manner, sent a copy of verses to be examined, when Voltaire said to Maintenue, \"Let us leave off for the present, my friend; you see the king has lent me his dirty linen to wash, I will wash yours another time.\" A single word is sometimes sufficient to ruin a man at court; Maupeutus imputed such a word to Voltaire, and succeeded. It was about this very time that Maupeutus published his very strange Philosophical Letters; and M. de Voltaire did not fail to heighten, with his utmost powers of raillery, everything which he found, or could make, ridiculous, in the projects of M. Maupeutus, who was careful to unite his own cause with that of the king; Voltaire was considered as having failed in respect to his majesty; and therefore, in the most respectful manner, he returned to the king his chamberlain's key, and the cross of his Order of Merit: accompanied with four lines of verse; in which he, with great delicacy, compares his situation to that of a jealous lover, who lends back the picture of his mistress. The king returned the key and the ribbon; but they were not followed by an immediate reconciliation. Voltaire set out to pay a visit to her highness the duchess of Gotha, who honoured him with her friendship as long as she lived. While he remained at Gotha, Maupeutus employed all his batteries against him: Voltaire was arrested by the king's orders, but afterwards released.\n\nHe now settled near Geneva; but afterward being obliged to quit that republic, he purchased the castle of Ferney in France, about a league from the lake of Geneva. It was here that he undertook the defence of the celebrated family of Calas; and it was not long before he had a second opportunity of vindicating the innocence of another condemned family of the name of Sirven. It is somewhat remarkable, that in the year 1774, he had the third time a singular opportunity of employing that same zeal which he had the good fortune to display in the fatal catastrophe of the families of Calas and Sirven.\n\nIn this retreat M. Voltaire continued long to enjoy the pleasures of a rural life, accompanied with the admiration of a vast number of wits and philosophers throughout all Europe. Wearied at length, however, with his situation, or yielding to the importunities of friends, he came to Paris about the beginning of the year 1778, where he wrote a new tragedy called Irene. By this time his understanding seems to have been impaired, either through the infirmities of age, or continued intoxication by the flattery of others; and he ridiculously suffered himself to be crowned in public with laurel, in testimony of his great poetical merit. He did not long survive this farce; for having overheated himself with receiving visits, and exhausted his spirits by supplying a perpetual fund of conversation, he was first seized with a spitting of blood; and at last becoming restless in the night-time, he was obliged to use a soporific medicine. Of this he unluckily one night took too large a dose, that he slept 36 hours, and expired a very short time after awakening from it.","sp":208,"ep":209},{"h":"VOLUME","t":"in matters of literature, a book or writing of a just bulk to be bound by itself.

They make up a considerable part of the Pagan worship, being made either in consequence of some deliverance, under some pressing necessity, or for the success of some enterprise. Among the Jews, all vows were to be voluntary, and made by persons wholly in their own power; and if such person made a vow in any thing lawful and possible, he was obliged to fulfil it. If he appointed no particular time for accomplishing his vow, he was bound to do it instantly, lest by delay he should prove useless, or be unwilling, to execute his promise.

Josephus, and several others, maintain, that it meant the precious stones set in the high-priest's breast-plate, which by extraordinary lustre made known the will of God to those who consulted him. Spencer believes that the urim and thummim were two little golden figures shut up in the pectoral as in a purse, which gave responses with an articulate voice. In short, there are as many opinions concerning the urim and thummim as there are particular authors that wrote about them. The safest opinion, according to Broughton, seems to be, that the words urim and thummim signify some divine virtue and power annexed to the breast-plate of the high-priest, by which an oracular answer was obtained from God when he was consulted by the high-priest; and that this was called urim and thummim, to express the clearness and perfection which these oracular answers always carried with them; for urim signifies \"light,\" and thummim \"perfection;\" these answers not being imperfect and ambiguous, like the heathen oracles, but clear and evident.\n\nThe use made of the urim and thummim was to consult God in difficult cases relating to the whole state of Israel; and sometimes in cases relating to the king, the sanhedrim, the general of the army, or some other great personage.\n\nUrinal, in Medicine, a vessel fit to receive and hold urine, and used accordingly for the convenience of sick persons.

He observes, that every church at its consecration received the name of some particular saint: this custom was practised among the Roman Britons, and continued among the Saxons; and in the council of Cealchylde, in 816, the name of the denominating saint was expressly required to be inscribed on the altars, and also on the walls of the church, or a tablet within it. The feast of this saint became of course the festival of the church. Thus Christian festivals were substituted in the room of the idolatrous anniversaries of heathenism: accordingly, at the first introduction of Christianity among the Jutes of Kent, Pope Gregory the Great advised, what had been previously done among the Britons, viz. Christian festivals to be instituted in the room of the idolatrous, and the suffering day of the martyr whose relics were reposited in the church, or the day on which the building was actually dedicated, to be the established feast of the parish. Both were appointed and observed; and they were clearly distinguished at first among the Saxons, as appears from the laws of the Confessor, where the dies dedicationis, or dedicatio, is repeatedly discriminated from the propria festivitas sancti, or celebratio sancti. They remained equally distinct to the Reformation; the dedication-day in 1536 being ordered for the future to be kept on the first Sunday in October, and the festival of the patron saint to be celebrated no longer. The latter was, by way of pre-eminence, denominated the church's holiday, or its peculiar festival; and while this remains in many parishes at present, the other is so utterly annihilated in all, that Bishop Kennet (says Mr Whitaker) knew nothing of its distinct existence, and has attributed to the day of dedication what is true only concerning the saint's day. Thus instituted at first, the day of the tutelar saint was observed, most probably by the Britons, and certainly by the Saxons, with great devotion. And the evening before every saint's day, in the Saxon Jewish method of reckoning the hours, being an actual hour of the day,\nand therefore like that appropriated to the duties of public religion, as they reckoned Sunday from the first to commence at the sunset of Saturday; the evening preceding the church's holyday would be observed with all the devotion of the festival. The people actually repaired to the church, and joined in the services of it; and they thus spent the evening of their greater festivities in the monasteries of the North, as early as the conclusion of the seventh century.\n\nThese services were naturally denominated from their late hours wecan or wakes, and vigils or eves. That of the anniversary at Rippon, as early as the commencement of the eighth century, is expressly denominated the vigil. But that of the church's holyday was named cyrie wecan, or church-wake, the church-vigil, or church eve. And it was this commencement of both with a wake, which has now caused the days to be generally preceded with vigils, and the church-holiday particularly to be denominated the church-wake. So religiously was the eve and festival of the patron saint observed for many ages by the Saxons, even as late as the reign of Edgar, the former being spent in the church, and employed in prayer. And the wakes, and all the other holidays in the year, were put upon the same footing with the Octaves of Christmas, Easter, and of Pentecost. When Gregory recommended the festival of the patron saint, he advised the people to erect booths of branches about the church on the day of the festival, and to fealt and be merry in them with innocence. Accordingly, in every parish, on the returning anniversary of the saint, little pavilions were constructed of boughs, and the people indulged in them to hospitality and mirth. The feasting of the saint's day, however, was soon abused; and even in the body of the church, when the people were assembled for devotion, they began to mind diversions, and to introduce drinking. The growing intemperance gradually stained the service of the vigil, till the festivity of it was converted, as it now is, into the rigour of a fast. At length they too justly scandalized the Puritans of the last century, and numbers of the wakes were disfused entirely, especially in the east and some western parts of England; but they are commonly observed in the north, and in the midland counties.\n\nThis custom of celebrity in the neighbourhood of the church, on the days of particular saints, was introduced into England from the continent, and must have been familiar equally to the Britons and Saxons; being observed among the churches of Asia in the fifth century, and by those of the west of Europe in the seventh. And equally in Asia and Europe, on the continent and in the islands, these celebrities were the causes of those commercial marts which we denominate fairs. The people resorted in crowds to the festival, and a considerable provision would be wanted for their entertainment. The prospect of interest invited the little traders of the country to come and offer their wares; and thus, among the many pavilions for hospitality in the neighbourhood of the church, various booths were erected for the sale of different commodities. In larger towns, surrounded with populous districts, the resort of the people to the wakes would be great, and the attendance of traders numerous; and this resort and attendance constitute a fair.\u2014Baili expressly mentions the numerous appearance of traders at these festivals in Asia, and Gregory notes the same custom to be common in Europe. And as the festival was observed on a feria or holiday, it naturally assumed to itself, and as naturally communicated to the mart, the appellation of feria or fair. Indeed several of our most ancient fairs appear to have been usually held, and have been continued to our time, on the original church-holidays of the places; besides, it is observable, that fairs were generally kept in church-yards, and even in the churches, and also on Sundays, till the indelicacy and scandal were so great as to need reformation.\n\n**Wake-Robin.** See ARUM, BOTANY Index.\n\n**Walachia,** a province of Turkey in Europe, bounded on the north by Moldavia and Transylvania, on the east and south by the river Danube, and on the west by Transylvania. It is 225 miles in length, and 125 in breadth; and was ceded to the Turks by the treaty of Belgrade, in 1739. It abounds in good horses and cattle; and there are mines of several kinds. The soil is so fertile, that it is capable of producing anything; and there are good pastures, with wine, oil, and all manner of European fruits. The inhabitants are chiefly of the Greek church.\n\n**Walcheren,** an island of the Low Countries, and one of the principal of those of Zealand; separated from Dutch Flanders by the mouth of the Scheldt. It is about nine miles in length, and eight in breadth; and though it lies low, has good arable and pasture land. The chief town of this island and the whole province is Middleburgh. But the principal sea port is Flushing, which is strongly fortified. Walcheren was taken by the British forces in August 1809; but it soon after was abandoned, the troops having suffered severely by sickness.\n\n**Walden,** a town of Essex, commonly called Saffron Walden, with a market on Saturdays, and two fairs on Midlent Saturday for horses, and November 1st for cows.

His followers, who from him were called Waldenses, being chased from Lyons, spread over Dauphin\u00e9 and Provence; upon which Philip II. is said to have razed 300 gentlemen's seats, and destroyed several walled towns to stop their growth: but this, instead of suppressing, spread them over a great part of Europe. The articles of their faith, which they drew up and dedicated to the king of France, agreed in most points with those of the present Protestants. In the year 1200, those of them who dwelt in the province of Albigeois in Languedoc, from whence they were called Albigenesi, stood upon their defence; upon which Philip drove them into Bohemia, Savoy, and England. The crusade against them is said to have consisted of 500,000 men, who wore their crosses on their breasts, to distinguish themselves from those who went to the Holy Land, and wore them on their shoulders.\n\n**Wales,** a country situated in the south-west part of\nof Britain, into which the ancient Britons retired from the persecution of the Saxons. Anciently it was of greater extent than it is at present, and comprehended all the country beyond the Severn, that is, besides the 12 counties included in it at present, those of Herefordshire and Monmouthshire, which now are reckoned a part of England, were then inhabited by three different tribes of the Britons, namely, the Silures, the Demet\u00e6, and the Ordovices. The Romans were never able to subdue them, till the reign of Vespasian, when they were reduced by Julius Frontinus, who placed garrisons in their country to keep them in awe. Though the Saxons made themselves masters of all England, they never could get possession of Wales, except the counties of Monmouthshire and Herefordshire, formerly a part of Wales. About the year 870, Roderic king of Wales divided it among his three sons; and the names of these divisions were, Demetia, or South-Wales; Powefa, or Powys-Land; and Venedotia, or North Wales. Another division is mentioned afterwards in the records, viz. North Wales, South Wales, and West Wales; the last comprehending the counties of Monmouth and Hereford. The country derived the name of Wales, and the inhabitants that of Welsh, from the Saxons, who by those terms denote a country and people to which they are strangers; for the Welsh, in their own language, call their country Cymru, and their language Cymraeg. They continued under their own princes and laws from the above-mentioned period, and were never entirely subjected to the crown of England till the reign of Edward I., when Llewellyn ap Gryffith, prince of Wales, lost both his life and dominions. Edward, the better to secure his conquest, and to reconcile the Welsh to a foreign yoke, sent his queen to lie in at Caernarvon, where she was delivered of a prince; to whom the Welsh, on that account, the more readily submitted. Ever since that time, the eldest sons of the kings of England have commonly been created princes of Wales, and as such enjoy certain revenues from that country.\n\nAs to the character of the Welsh, they are said to be a brave, hospitable people; and though very jealous of affronts, paffionate, and hafty, yet are easily reconciled. The common people look with a suspicious eye on strangers, and bear a hereditary grudge to the English nation, by whom their ancestors were expelled from the finest parts of the island. The gentlemen are apt to value themselves upon the antiquity of their families; and with some reason, as they can generally trace them much higher than the inhabitants of most other countries.\n\nAll the better sort, both in town and country, can speak English, especially in the counties bordering upon England. The common people, in general, only speak their own language, which is the ancient British; and not only differs entirely from the English, but has very little affinity with any of the western tongues, unless we should except the Gaelic, Erse, or Irish. It is said to be a dialect of the ancient Celtic, and in many respects to resemble the Hebrew. Most of the clergy are natives of the country, and understand English so well, that they could exercise their functions in any part of Britain. The public worship, however, is as often performed in Welsh as in English, excepting in the towns, where the latter is the prevailing language. The inhabitants are computed at about 300,000.\n\nThe country, though mountainous, especially in North Wales, is far from being barren or unfruitful; the hills, besides the metals and minerals they contain, feeding vast herds of small black cattle, deer, sheep, and goats, and their valleys abounding in corn, as their seas and rivers do in fish. Here are also wood, coal, and turf for fuel, in abundance.\n\nWales is bounded on all sides by the sea and the Severn; except on the east, where it joins to the counties of Chester, Salop, Hereford, and Monmouth. Its length, from the southernmost part of Glamorganshire to the extremity of Flintshire north, is computed at about 113 miles; and its greatest breadth, from the river Wye east to St David's in Pembrokeshire west, is nearly of the same dimensions, being about 90 miles.\n\nAfter the conquest of Wales by Edward I., very material alterations were made in their laws, so as to reduce them nearer to the English standard, especially in the forms of their judicial proceedings; but they still retained very much of their original polity, particularly their rule of inheritance, viz. that their lands were divided equally among all the issue male, and did not descend to the eldest son alone. By other subsequent statutes their provincial immunities were still further abridged; but the finishing stroke to their dependency was given by the statute 27 Hen. VIII. c. 26, which at the same time gave the utmost advancement to their civil prosperity, by admitting them to a thorough communication of laws with the subjects of England.\u2014Thus were this brave people gradually conquered into the enjoyment of true liberty; being infensibly put upon the same footing, and made fellow-citizens, with their conquerors.\n\nIt is enacted by the 27 Hen. VIII. c. 1. That the dominion of Wales shall be for ever united to the kingdom of England. 2. That all Welshmen born shall have the same liberties as other king's subjects. 3. That lands in Wales shall be inheritable according to the English tenures and rules of descent. 4. That the laws of England, and no other, shall be used in Wales: besides many other regulations of the police of this principality. And the 34 and 35 Hen. VIII. c. 26, confirms the same, adds further regulations, divides it into 12 shires, and, in short, reduces it into the same order in which it stands at this day; differing from the kingdom of England in only a few particulars, and those too of the nature of privileges (such as having courts within itself, independent of the process of Westminster-hall), and some other immaterial peculiarities, hardly more than are to be found in many counties of England itself.\n\nNew WALES.

He was born in 1605; and his father dying when he was very young, the care of his education fell to his mother, who sent him to Eton school. He was afterwards sent to King's college in Cambridge, where he must have been very affilious in his studies, since, at fifteen or seventeen years of age, he was chosen into the last parliament of King James I. and served as burgess for Agmondesham. He began to exercise his poetical talent so early as the year 1623; as appears from his verses \"upon the danger his majesty (being prince) escaped in the road of St Andero;\" for there Prince Charles, returning from Spain that year, had like to have been cast away. It was not, however, Mr Waller's wit, his fine parts, or his poetry, that so much occasioned him to be first publicly known, as his carrying off the daughter and sole heiress of a rich citizen, against a rival whose interest was espoused by the court. It is not known at what time he married his first lady; but he was a widower before he was 25, when he began to have a passion for Sacharissa, which was a fictitious name for the lady Dorothy Sidney, daughter to the earl of Leicester, and afterwards wife to the earl of Sunderland. He was now known at court, cared for by all who had any relish for wit and polite literature; and was one of the famous club of which Lord Falkland, Mr Chillingworth, and other eminent men, were members. He was returned burgess for Agmondesham in the parliament which met in April 1640. An intermission of parliaments having disquieted the nation, and raised jealousies against the designs of the court, which would be sure to discover themselves whenever the king came to ask for a supply, Mr Waller was one of the first who condemned the preceding measures. He showed himself in opposition to the court, and made a speech in the house on this occasion; from which we may gather some notion of his general principles in government; wherein, however, he afterwards proved very variable and inconsistent. He opposed the court also in the long parliament which met in November following, and was chosen to impeach Judge Crawley, which he did in a warm and eloquent speech, July 16th 1641.\n\nThis speech was so highly applauded, that 20,000 copies of it were sold in one day. In 1642, he was one of the commissioners appointed by the parliament to present their propositions of peace to the king at Oxford. In 1643, he was deeply engaged in a design to reduce the city of London and the tower to the service of the king; for which he was tried and condemned, together with Mr Tomkins his brother-in-law, and Mr Challoner. The two latter suffered death; but Mr Waller obtained a reprieve: he was, however, sentenced to suffer a year's imprisonment, and to pay a fine of 10,000l. After this, he became particularly attached to Oliver Cromwell, upon whom he wrote a very handsome panegyric. He also wrote a noble poem on the death of that great man.\n\nAt the Restoration, he was treated with great civility by Charles II. who always made him one of the party in his diversions at the duke of Buckingham's and other places. He wrote a panegyric upon his majesty's return; which being thought to fall much short of that he had before written on Oliver Cromwell, the king one day asked him in raillery, \"How is it, Waller, that you wrote a better encomium on Cromwell than on me?\" \"May it please your majesty,\" answered he, \"we poets generally succeed best in fiction.\" He sat in several parliaments after the Restoration, and continued in the full vigour of his genius to the end of his life, his natural vivacity bearing him up, and making his company agreeable to the last. He died of a dropy in 1687, and was interred in the churchyard of Beaconsfield, where a monument is erected to his memory. Mr Waller has been honoured as the most elegant and harmonious versifier of his time, and a great refiner of the English language.

While he lived in this family, he cultivated the art of deciphering; and it is said, that the elector of Brandenburg, for whom he explained several letters written in ciphers, sent him a gold chain and medal. In 1643 he published, \"Truth tried; or Animadversions on the Lord Brooke's treatise, called The Nature of Truth, &c.\" The next year he was chosen one of the secretaries or secretaries to the assembly of divines at Westminster. Dr Peter Turner, Savilian professor of geometry in Oxford, being ejected by the parliament-visitors in 1649, Mr Wallis was appointed to succeed him in that place. In 1633 he published at Oxford a Grammar of the English Tongue in Latin. In 1655 he entered the lists with Mr Hobbes; and their controversy lasted a considerable time. In 1657 the Doctor published his Mathematical Works. Upon the death of Dr Langbaine, he was chosen custos archivorum of the university. After the Restoration he met with great respect, the king himself entertaining a favourable opinion of him on account of some services he had done both to his royal father and himself. He was therefore confirmed in his places, admitted one of the king's chaplains in ordinary, and appointed one of the divines empowered to review the book of common prayer. He complied with the terms\nterms of the act of uniformity, and continued a steady conformity till his death. He was one of the first members of the Royal Society, and corresponded with many learned men. In 1697, the curators of the university press at Oxford thought it for the honour of the university to collect the mathematical works of the Doctor, which had been printed separately, some in Latin, some in English, and published them all together in the Latin tongue, in three vols., folio. He died in 1703. He speaks of himself thus: \"It hath been my endeavour all along to act by moderate principles, being willing whatever side was uppermost, to promote any good design for the true interest of religion, of learning, and of the public good.\" Besides the works above-mentioned, he published many others.","sp":216,"ep":217},{"h":"WALLOONS","t":"a name for the inhabitants of a considerable part of the Netherlands, viz.

In 1705, he was nominated one of the council to Prince George of Denmark, lord high admiral of England; in 1707, appointed secretary at war; and, in 1709, treasurer of the navy. In 1710, upon the change of the ministry, he was removed from all his posts, and held no place afterwards during the queen's reign. In 1711 he was expelled from the house of commons for what they called notorious corruption in his office as secretary at war. The borough of Lynn, however, re-elected him; and, though the house declared the election void, yet they persisted in the choice. In the well-known debate relating to Steele for publishing the Crisis, he greatly distinguished himself in behalf of liberty, and added to the popularity he had before acquired.\n\nOn the death of the queen, a revolution of politics took place, and the Whig party prevailed both at court and in the senate. Walpole had before recommended himself to the house of Hanover by his zeal for its cause, when the commons considered the state of the nation with regard to the Protestant succession; and he had now the honour to procure the assurance of the house to the new king (which attended the address of condolence and congratulation), \"That the commons would make good all parliamentary funds.\" It is therefore not to be wondered at, that his promotion soon took place after the king's arrival; and that in a few days he was appointed receiver and pay-master general of all the guards and garrisons, and of all other the land forces in Great Britain, paymaster of the royal hospital at Chelsea, and likewise a privy counsellor. On the opening of a new parliament, a committee of secrecy was chosen to inquire into the conduct of the late ministry, of which Walpole was appointed chairman; and, by his management, articles of impeachment were read against the earl of Oxford, Lord Bolingbroke, the duke of Ormond, and the earl of Strafford. The eminent service he was thought to have Walpole done the crown, by the vigorous prosecution of those ministers who were deemed the chief instruments of the peace, was soon rewarded by the extraordinary promotions to the offices of first commissioner of the treasury, and chancellor and under treasurer of the exchequer.\n\nIn two years time he resigned all his offices, on account of a misunderstanding which took place between him and the rest of the ministry about certain supplies demanded for the support of his majesty's German dominions. On the day of his resignation he brought in the famous sinking-fund bill, which he presented as a country gentleman, saying, that he hoped it would not fare the worse for having two fathers; and that his successor Mr Stanhope would bring it to perfection. His calling himself the father of a project, which hath since been so often employed to other purposes than were at first declared, gave his enemies frequent opportunity for satire and ridicule; and it hath been sarcastically observed, that the father of this fund appeared in a very bad light when viewed in the capacity of a nurse. In the next session of parliament, Walpole opposed the ministry in every thing; and even Wyndham or Shippen did not exceed him in patriotism. Upon a motion in the house for continuing the army, he made a speech of above an hour long, and displayed the danger of a standing army in a free country, with all the powers of eloquence. Early in 1720 the rigour of the patriot began to soften, and the complaisance of the courtier to appear; and he was again appointed paymaster of the forces, and several of his friends were found soon after in the list of promotions. No doubt now remained of his entire conversion to court measures; for, before the end of the year, we find him pleading as strongly for the forces required by the war-office as he had before declaimed against them, even though at this time the same pretences for keeping them on foot did not exist.\n\nIt was not long before he acquired full ministerial power, being appointed first lord commissioner of the treasury, and chancellor of the exchequer; and, when the king went abroad in 1723, he was nominated one of the lords justices for the administration of government, and was sworn sole secretary of state. About this time he received another distinguished mark of the royal favour; his eldest son then on his travels being created a peer, by the title of Baron Walpole of Walpole. In 1725 he was made knight of the Bath, and the year after knight of the Garter. The measures of his administration, during the long time he remained prime or rather sole minister, have been often canvassed with all the severity of critical inquiry. It is difficult to discern the truth through the exaggerations and misrepresentations of party. He has indeed been accused of employing the sinking fund for the purposes of corruption, of which it was long the fashion to call him the father; but the man who reflects on the transactions of Charles II. and his infamous cabal, will acquit him of the latter part of this charge. He was an enemy to war, and the friend of commerce; and because he did not resent some petty insults of the court of Spain so suddenly as the fiery part of the nation thought he should have done, a formidable opposition was formed against him in the house, which had influence enough to\nto employ in its cause almost all the wit of the nation. Pulteney and Pitt were the great leaders of the party in the house of commons; while Bolingbroke and Pope and Johnson, and almost every man of genius, exerted themselves without doors to enlighten, by pamphlets in prose and verse, the minds of the people, and throw the necessity of a Spanish war. This he strenuously opposed, because he knew that the foreign settlements of that power are very remote, and in a climate destructive to Englishmen; and that such of them as we might be able to take, we could not possibly retain. The opposition however prevailed. The nation was indulged in a war, of which it surely had no cause to boast of the success; and it is now universally known, that the greater part of those who with honest intentions had, either in parliament or out of it, been engaged to pull down the minister, lived to repent of their conduct, and do justice to the man whom they had so pertinaciously vilified.\n\nIn order to encourage commerce and improve the revenue, Sir Robert projected a scheme for an extension of the excise, as the only means of putting a stop to the frauds of merchants and illicit traders. This was another ground of clamour to the orators within, and the wits without, doors; and while the opposition represented it as a measure big with public mischief, Swift and Pope occasionally alluded to it as an oppression calculated to deprive private life of all its comforts. The minister was therefore obliged to abandon the scheme; but in a succeeding administration it was partly carried into execution, at the express solicitation of the principal persons concerned in that article of trade which it was suggested would be most affected by it; and afterwards the most popular minister that ever directed the councils of this country declared in full senate, that if a time should ever arrive which was likely to render the project feasible, he would himself recommend an extension of the excise laws as a measure of the greatest advantage to commerce, to the revenue, and to the general interests of the kingdom.\n\nIn 1742 the opposition prevailed; and Sir Robert being no longer able to carry a majority in the house of commons, resigned all his places, and fled for shelter behind the throne. He was soon afterwards created earl of Orford; and the king, in consideration of his long and faithful services, granted him a pension of \u00a34000 per annum. The remainder of his life he spent in tranquillity and retirement, and died, in 1745, in the 71st year of his age.\n\nHe has been severely, and not unjustly, censured for that system of corruption by which he almost avowed that he governed the nation; but the objects which he had in view are now acknowledged to have been in a high degree praiseworthy. Johnson, who in the earlier part of his life had joined the other wits in writing against his measures, afterwards honoured his memory for the placability of his temper, and for keeping this country in peace for so many years; and Mr Burke has declared, that his only defect as a minister was the want of sufficient firmness to treat with contempt that popular clamour, which, by his yielding to it, hurried the nation into an expensive and unjust war. But his rancorous prosecution of Atterbury bishop of Rochester (see Atterbury), by a bill of pains and penalties, may be considered as something worse than a defect: it was a fault for which no apology can be made; because, whether that prelate was innocent or guilty, of his guilt no legal proof ever appeared. In that instance the conduct of the minister was the more extraordinary, that on other occasions he chose to gain over the disaffected by mildness and benevolence, even when he had sufficient proofs of their guilt. Of this the following anecdote, communicated by Lord North to Dr Johnson, is a sufficient proof, Sir Robert having got into his hands some treasonable papers of his inveterate enemy Shippen, sent for him, and burnt them before his eyes. Some time afterwards, while Shippen was taking the oaths to the government in the house of commons, Sir Robert, who stood next to him, and knew his principles to be the same as ever, smiled; upon which Shippen, who had observed him, said \"Egad, Robin, that's hardly fair.\"\n\nTo whatever objections his ministerial conduct may be liable, in his private character he is universally allowed to have had amiable and benevolent qualities. That he was a tender parent, a kind master, a benevolent patron, a firm friend, an agreeable companion, are points that have been seldom disputed; and so calm and equal was his temper, that Pulteney, his great rival and opponent, said, he was sure that Sir Robert Walpole never felt the bitterest invectives against him for half an hour.\n\nAbout the end of Queen Anne's reign, and the beginning of George I's, he wrote the following pamphlets. 1. The Sovereign's Answer to the Gloucestershire Address. The Sovereign meant Charles duke of Somerset, so nicknamed by the Whigs. 2. Answer to the Representation of the House of Lords on the State of the Navy, 1729. 3. The Debts of the Nation stated and considered, in four Papers, 1710. 4. The Thirty-five Millions accounted for, 1710. 5. A Letter from a foreign Minister in England to Monseigneur Pettecum, 1710. 6.

Sir Francis was undoubtedly one of the most refined politicians and most penetrating statesman that any age ever produced. He had an admirable talent, both in discovering and managing the secret recesses of the heart. He had his spies in most courts in Christendom, and allowed them a liberal maintenance; for it was his maxim, That knowledge cannot be bought too dear. In 1587 the king of Spain having made vast preparations, which surprised, and kept all Europe in suspense, Walsingham employed his utmost endeavours for the discovery of that important secret; and accordingly procured intelligence from Madrid, that the king had informed his council of his having dispatched an express to Rome, with a letter written with his own hand to the pope, acquainting him with the true design of his preparations, and begging his blessings upon him; which for some reasons he could not disclose till the return of the courier. The secret being thus lodged with the pope, Walsingham, by means of a Venetian priest, whom he retained at Rome as a spy, got a copy of the original letter, which was stolen out of the pope's cabinet by a gentleman of the bed-chamber, who took the key out of the pope's pocket while he slept. After this, by his dexterous management, he caused the Spaniards bills to be protested at Genoa, which should have supplied them with money for their extraordinary preparations and by this means he happily retarded this formidable invasion for a whole year. In short, he spent his whole time and faculties in the service of Queen Elizabeth; on which account her majesty was heard to say, \"That in diligence and sagacity he exceeded her expectations.\"\n\nHowever, after all his eminent services to his country, this man gave a remarkable proof at his death, which happened on the 6th of April 1590, how far he preferred the public interest to his own; he being so poor, that excepting his library, which was a very fine one, he had scarcely effects enough to defray the expense of his funeral.

Part II.\npreferve that due and equable balance of power among neighbouring states, which has of late been considered as an essential point in the political economy of civilized nations. We say that these are usually the objects of war; for though it will scarcely be denied that ambition, avarice, religious bigotry, a desire of dominion, and a thirst of military fame, have been the real causes of many of those long and bloody wars which have desolated the face of nature, and heaped misery and wretchedness on millions of human beings, we believe few heroes and conquerors, either of ancient or modern times, have had the honesty or effrontery to avow these as the real motives of their military expeditions. Yet, if we examine the pages of history, we shall scarcely find a war, from the Battle of the Kings recorded by the sacred historian, to the present contest which has for 17 years involved all Europe in confusion and bloodshed, and reduced many of its fairest states and provinces under the subjection of a single monarch, in which one or other of these latter motives has not, at least to one party, been a principal inducement.\n\nAmong the political objects of war, we must not omit to mention one which, though perhaps less openly avowed than any other, has, in monarchical and aristocratical governments, always formed a material part of the state policy;\u2014we mean the object of preventing tumults and commotions among the people, by engaging them in a foreign war. It was long ago observed by a good judge of human nature*, \"that no body can be healthful without exercise, neither natural body nor politic;\" and that \"to a kingdom or a state, a just and honourable war is the true exercise.\" That politicians have often acted on these principles, is certain. On the justice of the principles themselves, we presume not to decide, though we may safely express a doubt whether the remedy be not worse than the disease, and whether these popular commotions might not be prevented with equal ease, and with more advantage to the nation, by employing the populace in such works of improvement as may advance the manufactures, commerce, or internal comforts of the state.\n\nAn able and ingenious writer considers a redundancy of population as one of the chief primary causes of war. \"One of its first causes and most powerful impulses, was undoubtedly an insufficiency of room and food; and, greatly as the circumstances of mankind have changed since it first began, the same cause still continues to operate, and to produce, though in a smaller degree, the same effects. The ambition of princes would want instruments of destruction, if the distresses of the lower classes did not drive them under their standards. A recruiting sergeant always prays for a bad harvest, and a want of employment, or, in other words, a redundant population\u2020.\" This redundancy he proposes to obviate, and thus to counteract one of the principal causes of war, by throwing obstacles in the way of marriage. Without calling in question the justness of his position, we do not see the necessity of the remedy which he proposes. We must acknowledge ourselves such friends to the increase of population as to think that every encouragement ought to be given to it, instead of throwing obstacles in its way. There are few countries so populous, or so completely cultivated, as to render it necessary to plunge them into wars, in order to diminish the number of inhabitants, which might be abundantly supported, were agriculture encouraged, and gluttony repressed.\n\nWhatever may be the objects for which a nation goes to war; whatever the causes which have induced her impolicy of having recourse to such an expedient, we may venture, from history and experience, to affirm that she will gain little solid advantage by the con-\u2020. She may drive an invading enemy from her dominions, and pursue him to his own; she may acquire plunder and territory, and may raise her name among the neighbouring states by her victories and prowess; but all these, except the first, will scarcely compensate for the blood and treasure which she has expended, and for the check given to her agriculture, manufactures and commerce, by drawing off many of the labouring part of the community to supply the fleets and armies of the state. These are the inevitable consequences even of a successful war; and should it prove otherwise, the calamities and distresses of the vanquished may readily be conceived. Even to the established government of a state, war, while it appears to strengthen their hands and increase their influence, is fraught with difficulty and danger. No situation of affairs is so well calculated to show the abilities or insufficiency of a cabinet as this, and melancholy is the fate of that nation whose administration is then conducted by a weak, inexperienced, or profligate ministry; but be they ever so able or so upright, still the want of success, or a reverse of fortune, will lower them in the opinion of the people, and will compel them at last to conclude a disadvantageous, perhaps a dishonourable peace, or quit their polls and leave the task to a more popular or successful administration.\n\nThe evils of war do not terminate on the return of peace. Many of the burdens which it had imposed on the people must still continue, to discharge the debt contracted by the state; while the sudden disbudding of the fleets and armies pours into the community numbers of idle and dissipated men, adverse to labour, and accustomed to scenes of confusion, slaughter and rapine. At no time are robberies, murders, or seditions so frequent as on the termination of a long protracted war; at none are the internal peace and quiet of a nation in so much danger.\n\nOn the moral evils of war we surely need not enlarge. In itself, when undertaken without necessity, it is an act of the most criminal and atrocious nature; and the aggressors are accountable for all the horrid consequences which may attend it. \"The pomp and circumstance of glorious war?\" may form a desirable subject for the poet and the historian; but the Christian and the philosopher must regard it with horror and detestation, as the greatest evil with which providence has been pleased to arm the hands of its ministers to punish and afflict mankind. A late amiable and learned prelate has laboured to prove that \"the frequency, duration, and cruelty of wars (in Christendom) are less now than formerly; but we think that neither his reasoning nor his examples are capable of establishing the first part of this position. If we take the last 700 years, and compare it with an equal period of ancient history; if we recollect the cruelties, the almost continual struggles between France and Britain, the civil dissensions in both these mighty empires, the wars between the Russians and their neighbours, the Turks, the Poles, and the Swedes; if we advert to the reigns of Edward...\nEdward III. of England, Charles V. and Philip II. of Spain, Louis XIV. of France, Gustavus Adolphus and Charles XII. of Sweden, Frederick II. of Prussia, and Catherine II. of Russia; and lastly, if we turn our attention to the long and ruinous contests which distinguish our own times, we shall find little cause to boast of having profited by the pacific lessons of our Saviour, whose great object was to promote \"peace on earth,\" and good will and brotherly love among the children of men.\n\nThere is indeed one consolatory circumstance with respect to the modern system of warfare, that our wars are now less sanguinary than those of ancient times. The immense slaughter which attended some of the battles in the Greek and Roman wars, where the greater part of the vanquished army was frequently put to the sword, is familiar to our classical readers; but in modern warfare, even of the large armies that have appeared in the field on the continent of Europe, we seldom find so many as 30,000 killed and wounded on both sides, a number vastly inferior to what fell of the Romans at Cannae, and by no means equal to the loss of the Carthaginians at the battle of Zama. This diminished slaughter is attributed, and we believe with justice, to the use of firearms; and it is computed that in this mode of fighting not more than one musket ball in 40 takes effect, and not more than one in 400 proves fatal. The introduction of these weapons, therefore, however it may be declaimed against by theorists, must be considered as a real improvement in the art of war; and it is sincerely to be regretted that the use of them should be laid aside. If, however, the present practice of deciding battles by the bayonet and the sabre be continued, it is to be feared that we shall soon rival the ancients as much in the sanguinary nature of our wars as in their frequency.\n\nAfter what we have said on the impolicy of war, and the moral evils which attend it, it will scarcely be expected that we should allow it to be justifiable, except in cases of necessity. Indeed we think that war can be justified only on the principles of self-defence. When a nation is invaded, or attacked in relation to her undoubted rights and principles, it is then, and then only, that she has a pretence for war. We will not, indeed, go so far as to assert, that she ought to await the attack. While she takes the best methods for defending her territories at home, it is doubtless proper, especially for a maritime state, to meet the enemy half-way, and by a timely and spirited resistance, endeavour to avert those greater evils which would attend a system of pusillanimity and neglect.\n\nIn the present state of human nature, war must be regarded as a necessary evil, and as it is sometimes unavoidable, the principles and practice of it must be studied by those who are to superintend or conduct its operations. It is this necessity that has given occasion to the art of war, the practice of which is to form the subject of the present article.\n\nBefore we enter on the immediate object of this essay, however, it may not be improper to enumerate those branches of knowledge which constitute the principles of the military art, and of which no officer who expects to have a principal command in military operations should be ignorant. We shall first mention those sciences which should form a part of the education of every command-\n\ning officer, whether military or naval; and we shall then distinguish between those which are most applicable to the land and the sea service.\n\nAmong the first branches of a military education must be enumerated the modern languages of French and German; geography, by which we would understand, not merely the description of countries, states, and kingdoms, but a knowledge of their political constitution, resources, and productions, and of the manners, customs, and character of their inhabitants; history, especially that of modern Europe, and of the Greeks and Romans. Among particular histories we would recommend those of Polybius, Xenophon, Tacitus, with the Commentaries of Caesar, in ancient history; and Davila's account of the civil wars of France, Guicciardini's history of the Italian wars, the history of the seven years war by Frederick the Great, with a particular attention to the best histories of his own country, and of the wars in which he has been engaged. After these preliminary branches follow the rudiments of mathematics, including common and logarithmic arithmetic, the elements of theoretical and practical geometry, plane and spherical trigonometry, the principles of surveying, conic sections, and their application to projectiles; certain parts of natural philosophy, especially mechanics; and the principles of drawing plans, maps, and charts.\n\nBesides these, a military officer should be instructed in fortification and gunnery, the nature of military exercises, and the duties of the various officers attached to an army; while the naval officer should particularly attend to astronomy, hydrodynamics, navigation, the principles of seamanship, and of shipbuilding.\n\nThere is perhaps no art or profession, in the practice of which the superiority of example over precept is more apparent than in war, inasmuch that we may lay it down as an axiom, that no man can be a soldier or a sailor from theory alone. It is not from books that we are to learn the art of war, though there is no doubt that they may greatly assist and improve the skill and experience acquired in the field or on the ocean. In these active scenes have been formed the great commanders, whose lives and actions are perused with so much avidity; and the only method of successfully imitating their exploits, and emulating their fame, is to encounter the dangers and the hardships to which they were exposed, and to learn how to command, by first learning to obey. A considerable share of the mechanical part of war may be acquired in a well-regulated military or naval school; but the experience necessary for a commander is to be gained only in actual service.\n\nThe practical part of war is usually divided into military tactics, and naval tactics; a division which we shall here adopt, though we have thought proper to bring the whole under one article. As the space, which we had originally allotted to these subjects, has unavoidably been reduced one half, we shall be able to give little more than a general outline, especially of military tactics, reserving the fuller discussion for naval tactics, which, to a nation whose chief dependence is on her fleets, must be the most useful and the most interesting part of the subject.\n\nIt would be vain for us to attempt any historical ac-\ncount of the progressive improvements that have been made in the art of war. Indeed this would be to repeat much of what has already been detailed under the principal historical articles of this work; for the history of nations, as it is commonly treated, is little more than a history of their wars. We might, no doubt, bring forward much curious information reflecting the offensive and defensive weapons of different ages and countries, and the character and organization of their armies; but for those and other matters of a similar nature, we may refer our readers to the following respectable authorities: Vegetius De re militari; Polybius's History, with the Commentaries of Polard; Salmatus De re militari Romanorum; Tacitus's Vita Agricola; Rollin's Ancient History; Potter's Grecian Antiquities; Kennet's and Adam's Roman Antiquities; Goguet's Origin of Laws, Arts, &c.; Daniel Histoire de la Milice Fran\u00e7oise; Gough's Sepulchral Monuments; Ashmole's Toxophilus, and Grose's History of the English Army, and Essay on Ancient Armour.\n\nAt a period like the present, when the two greatest powers of Europe are struggling for glory and dominion, it will not be thought uninteresting, or irrelevant to the subject of the present article, if we offer a comparative statement of the present military and naval establishments of these two mighty empires, with a sketch of the military character of their armies; and with these we shall conclude our preliminary observations.\n\nAccording to a statement made to the French government at the commencement of 1805, the grand total of the French armies consisted of 570,964 men; viz., infantry of the line, 341,412; light infantry, 100,130; cavalry, 77,488; artillery, 46,489; engineers, 5445. Since that time, more than 100,000 have been added, and, according to the best authority, the present total does not fall short of 700,000 men*. This vast body is divided into companies for both cavalry and infantry; a certain number of companies forming a battalion of infantry, or a squadron of cavalry. The denomination of regiment is appropriated to the cavalry and artillery, while a similar body of infantry is called a half brigade. The commanding officer of a regiment is called colonel; but the commander of a large body of infantry is called chief of brigade. The names of lieutenant-colonel and major are charged for those of chief of a battalion and chief of a squadron. Those general officers which in other armies are called major-generals, are, in the French service, denominated generals of brigade, and lieutenant-generals are there generals of division.\n\nThe corps of engineers has for its officers 8 inspectors general, 34 directors, 124 captains of the first class, 117 captains of the second class, 33 lieutenants of the first class, 21 of the second class, and 20 pupils under the lieutenants. Attached to this corps are 6 companies of miners, commanded by a chief of battalion. Each company is officered by a captain-commandant, a second captain, first and second lieutenant. Twelve battalions of miners; each battalion, containing 8 companies, forming in all 1606 men, including officers. The battalion staff is composed of a chief of battalion, an adjutant major, and an adjutant. Each company is officered by a captain, a lieutenant, and sub-lieutenant.\n\nTo raise and recruit this great military force, the French government has, since the year 1798, had recourse to one of the most tyrannical measures which was ever adopted by a despotic monarchy, we mean that of conscription, by which every man within a certain age, is made liable, under circumstances of the greatest rigour, to serve in the armies of the state. This system of conscription is exceedingly complex; but we are enabled, from a respectable periodical publication, to present such a summary of it as will be readily understood. France is divided into about 30 military governments, subject to a general of division and his staff, to which commissaries are attached as executive officers. The civil division consists of 122 departments; 24 of which have been acquired since the overthrow of the monarchy, exclusive of Tuscany, not included in any part of this statement. The departments are divided into districts or arrondissements, from three to five in number; the arrondissements into cantons, and the cantons into municipalities, amounting to about 55,000. Each department is governed by a prefect and his council, composed of a commissary of police, a mayor, and certain inspectors, denominated counsellors of prefecture; the district or arrondissement, by a subprefect and his council, of a similar formation. The cantons and municipalities are under the supervision of an administration, composed of the civil authorities, with a president at their head. A mayor, a commissary of police, and two officers of the government, styled adjoints, are allotted to each division having a population above 5000 souls. These several authorities are in strict subordination to each other, and at the control of the prefects and sub-prefects, who, themselves, are charged with a weighty and inflexible responsibility as to the military levies.\n\nBy the code de la conscription, all Frenchmen, between the ages of 20 and 25, are liable to serve. They are divided into five classes, from which the municipal administration draws up the lists for the ballot. These are transmitted to the prefects, by whom they are sent to the war minister, and when properly adjusted, the subprefect proceeds to the drawing of the quota imposed on each district. The conscripts drawn are formed into three divisions, the first called conscripts for actual service, the second the reserve, and the third supplementary conscripts. They are marched in companies of 100 men, to the places which are established as depots, where they are furnished with their arms and clothes. After this they are trained and exercised, so as to be insured of unremitting labour and fatigue.\n\nWhat gives peculiar energy to the French military system, is the circumstance that their officers rise by merit and experience, and not by interest. By a law of the directory, no person (with the exception of engineers) could become officers, who had not served three years in a subordinate capacity. The revolution naturally opened the way to merit; and, seconded by this admirable policy, has filled all the posts of their army with men, who unite in themselves the qualities of the folder, with the excellencies that qualify for command. It is not hazarding too much to assert, that nine-tenths of the present French officers have sprung from the ranks. Educated in distant camps, they know no other country, and, habituated by long devotion to the trade of war, it has become their element and their passion. Their whole fortune is staked on the sword; and their attachment is therefore necessarily secured, under the auspicious\nauipicious influence of a leader, whose indefatigable ambition occupies them in their favourite pursuits, and whose liberal impartiality feeds the hope of preferment, and divides the fruits of conquest. To their credit and example is due much of that spirit, which, notwithstanding the causes of alienation hitherto observed, seems to animate the whole frame of the army; and no small share of that potentate success which has attended the course of the French arms. Of the eighteen marechaux d'empire, fourteen have either emerged from the ranks, or ascended from the lowest employments. Most of the generals of division, and others who hold the principal commands, have the same origin, and sufficiently prove, that war is an experimental science, and that military renown is not the prerogative of birth, but the harvest of toil, or the bounty of fortune.\n\nWe have no certain means of ascertaining the present naval establishment of the French empire, though, as it may be said to have the command of the navies of Holland, Russia, and the remains of that of Denmark, it must still be regarded as of no trifling strength. The principal fleets are indeed kept blockaded by those of Britain, in the harbours of Brest, Rochefort, Toulon, the Scheldt, and the Texel; but the escape of any of these might be the means of conveying a considerable military force to the remaining colonies, or to the less powerful allies of France. In 1791, the French fleet consisted of 73 ships of the line, 67 frigates, 19 corvettes, and 67 small craft, making a total of 226. Since that time, however, have taken place the great naval victories of Howe, St Vincent, Duncan, and Nelfont, by which the greater part of that navy has been carried into British ports.\n\nIn estimating the military establishment of Britain, we shall, for the sake of more accurate comparison, first take the same period of 1805. The British land forces then consisted of 21,223 cavalry, 124,878 infantry (including 20,747 men for limited service, and 21,268 belonging to foreign and provincial corps in British pay), 89,809 militia, 8,559 artillery, besides about 430,000 volunteers, making a total of 674,469. To these must be added the royal artillery, the horse brigade, the brigade of gunners and drivers, and companies of foreign artillery, amounting to 16,670, and the corps of artificers and labourers, including 704 men. Thus the whole military force of Britain, in 1805, amounted to 769,843.\n\nSince the passing of Mr Windham's act, this number is somewhat diminished, though our military force is now probably more effective. At the end of 1808 it stood as follows. Two regiments of life-guards, one regiment of royal horse-guards, 7 of dragoon guards, 25 of dragoons, 3 battalions of riflemen, 7 battalions of foot-guards, 5 of light infantry, 176 battalions of infantry, a corps of royal horse artillery, a regiment of royal foot artillery, a corps of royal engineers, a brigade of artillery drivers, and a waggon train. The dragoons, independent of the royal life and horse guards, amounted to 19,200; the battalions of riflemen and light infantry to 8000; the infantry of the line to 149,600; the king's German legion to about 20,000; exclusive of about 96,000 regular militia, 250,000 local militia, and about 50,000 volunteers; making an effective force of about 580,000 men.\n\nEach regiment of not more than 500 men is officered by a colonel, a lieutenant-colonel, a major, 10 captains, 10 lieutenants, 8 ensigns, an adjutant, quartermaster, paymaster, a surgeon and assistant surgeon; a sergeant-major, a quartermaster-sergeant, with 30 ordinary sergeants, 30 corporals, a drum-major and 20 drummers. If the regiment amount to 750 men, it has usually an addition of second lieutenant-colonel, a second major, 10 sergeants, and 10 corporals.\n\nThe gradation of rank among the officers of the British army is as follows. Under the king, who commands the whole as captain-general, is the commander-in-chief; then follow the field-marshal, generals, lieutenant-generals, major-generals, brigadier-generals, colonels, lieutenant-colonels, majors, captains, and subalterns. The different departments of the army are under the superintendence of an adjutant-general, a quartermaster-general, a barrack-master-general, a commissary-general, a paymaster-general, a board of ordnance, and a medical board. See ADJUTANT, QUARtermaster, &c.\n\nThe army of the line is recruited by enlistment; the recruits receive a bounty, and are engaged to serve for a limited period, or for life. The militia is filled up by ballot, in the several counties to which it belongs, and also receives recruits by enlistment or by proxy. Hence the British soldier, while he considers himself as the servant of the king and the state, justly boasts of partaking in the general liberty of the subject. He is protected by fixed and definite laws, against the discretionary power of his commanding officer, and is encouraged to perform his duty by the liberality of his country; and not, as in France, compelled to it by the fear of punishment. His discipline indeed is strict; but he feels none of that severe and tyrannical coercion which seems to be the first principle of motion in the armies of Napoleon.\n\nIn its naval establishment, Britain justly boasts of being superior to every nation in the world. The number of her fleets, and the courage and discipline of her seamen, have given her the unrivalled dominion of the seas, of which it would be difficult for the whole combined navy of Europe to deprive her. In 1809, the naval force of Britain consisted of 157 ships of the line, 19 from 50 to 44, 184 frigates, 181 sloops, 308 brigs, making a total of 849 in commission; besides 56 of the line, 12 50's, 56 frigates, 44 sloops, 24 brigs, total 192 in ordinary and refitting; and 50 ships of the line, 20 frigates, 20 sloops, 10 brigs, total 100, building: making a grand total of 1141.\n\nThe progressive advance of our navy will appear by attending to the following recital of its tonnage at different periods, from the reign of Henry VIII. to the present time.\n\n| Year | Tons about |\n|------|------------|\n| At the death of Henry VIII. | 1547 | 12,400 |\n| Edward VI. | 1553 | 11,000 |\n| Mary | 1558 | 7000 |\n| Elizabeth | 1603 | 17,000 |\n| James I. | 1625 | 19,000 |\n| Rebellion | 1641 | 22,400 |\n| At the death of Charles I. | 1649 | uncertain |\n| At the Restoration | 1660 | 57,400 |\n| At the death of Charles II. | 1685 | 103,558 |\n| Abdication of James II. | 1688 | 141,900 |\n\nAt:","sp":219,"ep":223},{"h":"WAR","t":"At the death of William III. 1702 159,000\nAnne, 1714 167,170\nGeorge I. 1727 170,865\nGeorge II. 1760 321,200\n31st December, 1788 413,660\n1806 776,000\n1809 800,000\n\nIt appears, however, that notwithstanding the vast increase of our navy, not a single dockyard has been added to it since the reign of William III. about 109 years ago, at which time the tonnage of the naval force of this kingdom amounted to nearly 160,000 tons; it is now nearly 800,000 tons, or about five times as large.\n\nIn sketching the military character of the French and British armies at the commencement of the 19th century, we shall avail ourselves of the observations of an anonymous, but able and apparently impartial publication, which appeared soon after the peace of Amiens, entitled The Military Character of the European Armies at the Peace of Amiens.\n\nThe astonishing success which has attended the French arms on the continent of Europe, is to be attributed partly to the regular organization and severe discipline established by the Code de la Conscription, but it is still more to be ascribed to the skill, experience, and activity of their officers. The French generals early discovered the advantages resulting from dispatch. The alertness of the soldiers, the lightness of their baggage, and their attention to regularity in time of action, enabled them to execute their movements with a celerity which has frequently ensured success. In an open country, lines could not be preserved without difficulty. The French armies were therefore formed in columns. Brigade succeeded brigade, and when one division was repulsed, and fell back on the columns in the rear, those in their turn attacked the enemy, or sustained his shock, and fresh troops perpetually came forward, to supply the place of those which had been defeated.\n\nThe French battalions have no field-pieces attached to them; but this want is amply compensated by their flying artillery, which is composed of the flower of the French soldiers, and by its boldness and rapidity of movement, supplies the place of that large train of artillery with which the other European armies are usually burdened. It is a constant maxim in the French armies to have a body of reserve, composed of their best troops, and under the command of an able general. If the main body should be beaten, the reserve covers their retreat, and on more than one occasion it has snatched the victory from the hands of the enemy.\n\nThe French generals, like rich and bold gamblers, are incessantly tempting fortune. They look upon their losses as nothing, provided they succeed in the end. The little value at which they estimate their men, the certainty of being able to replace them, the personal ambition of their chief, and the customary superiority of their numbers, afford them an advantage which cannot be counteracted but by great skill, conduct and activity.\n\nThe soldiers of Britain are as intrepid by land as her sailors by sea. Their want of success on the continent cannot be ascribed to their want of bravery, but rather to the organization of the British armies, their inferiority of numbers, or the inexperience of the officers by whom they are commanded. Most of their commanding officers, instead of conforming to general regulations, follow their own particular plans and ideas, according to their several genius, acquirements, and prejudices. In a nation, which from the spirit of its constitution and the habits of its people, is formed rather for naval than military operations, a ministry, however enlightened, scarcely possesses that authority which is necessary to give uniformity to the different departments of the army, to constitute a regular and corresponding whole, and to surmount those obstacles which are thrown in the way of all uniformity of military system, by the distance and distribution of the troops. The small numbers in which British troops are generally compelled to act on the continent, and their mixture with those of other nations, to which they are sometimes even subservient, are circumstances extremely disadvantageous.\n\nIn a military life, good faith, honour, and courage, are the principal qualifications, and these are eminently conspicuous in the British army. Their military ardour is greater than what is seen in any other service, but this is in a great measure damped among the officers by the difficulty of promotion. Interest with ministers, and the necessity of raising money to defray the expenses of the different departments of the state, though far from being the most equitable, are here unhappily among the first means of military promotion.\n\nThe soldiers of the British army are possessed of elements to enable them, under a commander of abilities and officers of experience, to be the best troops in the world. They require neither brandy nor self-conceit to make them brave; their courage is innate; it is a national instinct. Their officers too usually possess much greater information on general topics than those of all other European nations, as education is more cultivated in Britain than elsewhere. They are attached to their profession, and follow it rather from generous motives and military spirit, than like mercenaries from a view of interest and profit.\n\nOn the political and moral principles of war, see Cicero De Officiis, Grotius De Jure Belli et Pacis, Puffendorf's Law of Nature and Nations, and Machiavel's Discorsi; and on the principles of war considered as a science, see a memoir by Maizeroy, in the 40th volume of Histoire de l'Academie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres, and Polard's Commentaries on Polybius.\n\nPART I. MILITARY TACTICS.\n\nSOME writers on the military art distinguish tactics from what they call strategy; understanding by the latter the science of military movements when not in fight of the enemy, or at least out of the range of their shot; while they describe the former to be the science of military movements in sight of an enemy, or within the range.\nrange of cannon shot. We do not see the necessity of this distinction; and under the head of military tactics we shall consider whatever relates to military operations on land.\n\nIt is not possible for us, within the very scanty limits to which we are now reduced, to give anything like a regular treatise on the military art. We shall therefore endeavour to select the most useful and interesting topics, and supply the place of disquisition by numerous plates with appropriate explanations.\n\nThe science of military tactics comprehends the disposition and arrangement of troops, whether on marches, in camps, or in line of battle; the attack and defence of posts; the construction and superintendence of the works by which they are to be defended; the conducting of sieges; and the defence of besieged places. These are the principal operations of a field army, and these we shall briefly consider nearly in the order in which we have enumerated them.\n\nTo direct the march of an army is not one of the least difficult parts of a general's duty. To do this with ability, he must be well acquainted with the nature of the country through which his troops are to pass, with the obstacles which are likely to oppose them in their progress, and with the disposition of the inhabitants. Our buffets here is only with the first of these considerations. There are three descriptions of countries which may become the theatre of war; an open country intersected by rivers, a mountainous, and a woody country. The march of an army through the first, as far as respects the face of the country alone, is seldom difficult, except in the passage of rivers, which we shall consider by and bye; and the last description of country is now so uncommon in Europe, that we need not dwell on it. A mountainous country, however, presents numerous difficulties to call forth the abilities and experience of a commander, as in such a country, not only are the roads winding and difficult of access, but the unevenness of the ground, and the intervals between the hills render it very easy for an enemy with a small force, to oppose and distress a numerous army.\n\nThe plan in Plate DXLIV. is intended to illustrate the march of an army through a mountainous country. At A is shown the position of the army previous to its march, with the artillery and baggage P, drawn up under their proper escorts, in front of the camp. At B are parties of hussars constituting the advanced guard of the army on its march; and at C are parties of infantry forming the advanced guard of the columns in which the army is disposed. D represents the infantry forming the head of the columns; E the park of artillery and waggons attached to it; F, battalions of artillery, G the cavalry, H the baggage of the army, and I their escort. At K are parties of hussars, and at L, parties of dragoons. M represents the infantry of the reserve forming the rear guard, and N platoons of infantry sent forward upon the heights, to cover the flanks of the principal columns. At O are villages in front of the position where the army is to encamp, and which have been taken possession of by the light infantry.\n\nThe number of columns into which the marching army is to be divided, will depend on the number of roads or accessible approaches that lead to the position which it is to take up. In the present case there are only two principal roads, each leading across the river, and winding through the valleys to the principal heights, so that the army must march in two divisions. The usual disposition of the columns is as follows. Four or five brigades of infantry, according to the number which composes the army, should be placed at the head of each column; the same partition should be made with regard to the artillery, which must follow the infantry; the cavalry must march next, and the baggage of each column, well escorted by infantry, must follow the cavalry, then the rest of the corps of light horse which are not detached; and the dragoons are placed the last, in order to dismount, and sustain the rear guard in case it shall be attacked.\n\nAn army seldom proceeds far without encountering a river in its march, and as it commonly happens in a country which has become the seat of war, that the bridges are destroyed or rendered impassable, the army must cross the river, either by swimming, at some ford, or by temporary bridges thrown over for the purpose. It is most advantageous to cross a river at some part where the stream is divided by small islands, unless the river be so shallow that it may be easily forded. If it be necessary to construct a bridge, this is best done by means of boats or pontoons, and all the necessary apparatus should be ready at the place of crossing at an appointed hour, and every measure should be taken to avoid confusion, and to be prepared for the enemy, who will probably dispute the passage. The two heads of the bridge when constructed should be entrenched, and well furnished with troops, and if possible, the islands in the neighbourhood should be fortified by proper works, to prevent the enemy from destroying the bridge, or accommodating the labourers employed in its construction.\n\nIf the river be narrow, it is best to cross at some place where it makes an angle, especially if, as commonly happens, one of its banks be higher than the opposite bank, so that the higher ground may be defended by a battery. If the river be fordable by infantry, care should be taken beforehand to clear the bed at the ford, and render the banks easy of access.\n\nThe lower figure of Plate DXLIV. illustrates the passage of a river. AAA represent bridges of boats; B, redoubts by which the bridges are protected; C, a battery, under cover of which the infantry work at the construction of the redoubts; D, a battery to prevent the enemy from annoying the army on its march; E, the march of the army; F, the artillery distributed among the brigades of infantry; G, infantry forming in columns to open on the opposite side through the intervals of the redoubts; H, march of the columns in the front of the redoubts, where they halt to give time for a part of the cavalry to form upon its flanks; I, a battery erected to facilitate the forming of the cavalry; K, cavalry, which, in gaining the opposite shore, forms in order of battle, and posts itself upon the flanks of the infantry; L, eight battalions in columns upon the right wing of the army, to go and examine the village, and attack the enemy in it, in case he should be posted off it; M, hussars and dragoons, who have taken possession of the height which is on the left wing of the army; N, a brigade of infantry posted next the height, covering the left wing of the cavalry; O, the disposition of the army marching up to the enemy.\n\nIt is in general a very difficult task to defend the passage.\nPage of a river against an army that is determined on crossing it. Indeed, if the river be of such a nature as to present several points by which an enemy can cross, and if the defending army be not of such strength as to meet their opponents in the field, such a defence will be almost impracticable. Where it can be attempted, however, and where sufficient notice can be procured of the enemy's approach, all the boats and barks found on the river should be removed or destroyed, to prevent the enemy from using them in constructing his bridges. Both banks of the river should be carefully reconnoitred, that the fords and other accessible points of passage may be sufficiently obstructed; and the ground which might protect the enemy's passage, should in particular be attended to. Roads sufficiently wide to admit of many columns, should be made along the side of the river to be defended, that a great number of troops may be advantageously disposed. It must be confessed, however, that if the accessible points extend along a considerable tract of country, and if the bank of the river next the enemy overhangs that on the opposite side, a defence will be nearly impossible.\n\nThe upper figure of Plate DXLV shows the manner of disposing the troops to defend the passage of the river. A, the march of the main army in three parts to defend the river; B, the camp of the light horse, infantry, and dragoons, on the wings of the army; C, castle and village, guarded by light infantry; D, a town occupied by the infantry belonging to the army; E, bridge broken down; F, islands occupied by infantry; G, posts of infantry distributed along the side of the river; H, batteries established along the side of the river; I, posts of cavalry, to keep the communication between the camps; K, bridges constructed to preserve the communication of the islands; L, bridges for the communication of the camps.\n\nModern warfare is distinguished from that of the ancients, not more with respect to the arms which it employs, than the multitude of stores, ammunition, and provisions necessary for a campaign. The number of horses now employed for drawing the artillery, and the ammunition wagons, as well as to mount the great increase of cavalry, considerably adds to the quantity of military stores required by the troops. This has produced the necessity for magazines, established in such number, and at such distances from each other, as may most expedite the operations of the campaign; and these magazines require not only to be fortified themselves, but to be strengthened by forts or redoubts in their vicinity. To these magazines modern writers on the art of war have appropriated the term of basins of military operations, and the roads by which an army receives its subsistence from the magazines, are called lines of operation. The situation of the principal magazine, and the length and direction of the lines of operation, are considered as of the highest importance. With respect to the first and second of these, we must refer to Templehoff's History of the Seven Years War, where the question is considered with great minuteness and scientific accuracy. The direction of a line of operations may be illustrated by the first seven figures of Plate DXLVI. Fig. 1 represents a line of operation forming the segment of a circle, having a line of posts ACB towards the enemy's country, and two principal fortresses DE within the segment. As this circular segment is supposed to surround a part of the enemy's territory, and is strengthened by the two fortresses AB, at the extremities of the basin, it is deemed the most advantageous form. On the other hand, if the segment had its circumference directed towards the enemy, as in fig. 2, it would form the worst possible direction for a basin; for here the fortresses CD, placed in the circumference, are very much exposed, and might be easily taken by detachments from the columns E and F. The only way of preventing this would be to detach troops from A and B laterally, to inconvenience the columns E and F, and to take up a strong position either at g or h. The more the segment approaches to the elliptical form, as in fig. 3, it is the least susceptible of defence, as is evident from the relative position of the three fortresses A, C, and B.\n\nThe line of operation represented by fig. 4, consisting of salient and obtuse angles, such as A c B, B d G, constitutes an excellent form, as it resembles the outworks of a fortress, and it is as impracticable for an enemy to enter into the interior of this basin, as to carry a curtain between two flanks. The two fortresses c d are not nearly so much exposed as C in fig. 3, as if one of them were attacked, it would be easy to make a diversion from the other into the enemy's country. If the points which terminate the basin advance as in fig. 5, it will be a favourable circumstance, especially if the most advanced post were bounded by the sea, or by a large river.\n\nThe basin which we have been considering consists of curved or angular lines. Now, let us suppose two basins, the one A h B, fig. 6, forming merely a straight line, while the other c e g d f, has two of its lines e c and d f advanced towards the enemy. This latter is the more advantageous, as it exposes so much more of the enemy's country. In general, it is a good rule to construct fortresses opposite to those of the enemy, as here the fortress g, if moderately strong, is capable of protecting the whole line from e to d, against the three opposite forts A h B. It is a great fault for any part of a basin to recede, as d c from the line of the enemy AB fig. 7, so as to form an angle with it, as here all the country between A and c is exposed to the hostile attacks of A and B; but, if the line were parallel to that of the enemy, as d e, it would be a good position.\n\nNext to the establishing of magazines, and providing for their security, and that of the lines by which they are connected, it is of the highest importance for a general when he takes the field, to select the proper positions where he may encamp his army, so as to be readily defended against the attacks of a superior enemy, and have an easy communication with his own posts. In selecting such a situation he must be guided partly by the nature of the country, and partly by the situation of the enemy; but if possible, he should choose a position which is rather elevated, and which may be protected on the flanks or rear, either by the natural situation of the ground, or by works thrown up for that purpose. It should not be too near the bank of a river, though it may be of advantage to have such an object in front. The encampment of an army in such a situation is pointed out by Plate DXLVII.; where A is the camp of the main body of the army; B, an advanced camp, composed of dragoons and hussars, in order to cover the right of the army, to guard the passes by which the enemy might make incursions upon the flanks and rear of the army, molest the convoys, and cut off the communications.\nnications; C, villages and bridges, guarded by the light infantry; D, posts of dismounted dragoons in the front of their camp; E, posts of dragoons on horseback, to secure the communication between their camp and that of the main body of the army; F, bridges built to keep up the communication between the grand and the advanced camp; G, bridges and villages guarded by detachments of infantry; H, grand guards of horse; I, guards of infantry; K, bridge, village, and mill, guarded by the infantry belonging to the army; L, camp of dragoons and hussars, covering the left of the army, and supporting the light infantry; M, villages and bridges guarded by the light infantry; N, posts of dismounted dragoons in the front and on the flanks of their camp; O, posts of dragoons on horseback; P, posts and detachments of hussars, to patrol in front and on the flanks of the army and their camp.\n\nIt often becomes necessary, either from an inferiority of numbers, or from the nature of the ground, to intrench or fortify a camp. In general this is done by digging deep ditches round the most defenceless part; driving palliades in front of this ditch; forming an embankment of felled trees, with their unopped branches pointing towards the enemy; or, where there is time for such an operation, and where the proper materials can be obtained, constructing redoubts or regular outworks, capable of being defended by artillery.\n\nPlate DXLVIII. represents a camp intrenched in an open country, without any peculiar advantages of defense. A, the main body of the army encamped behind its intrenchments; B, the camp of the troops of reserve; C, camp of the dragoons, to secure the rear of the army; D, camp of hussars, to cover the ground on the right of the army; E, villages and redoubts guarded by the light infantry, to secure the camp of the hussars; F, bridges built to secure the communication of the army with the ground on the right, and to favour the retreat of the troops posted on the opposite side; G, brigades of artillery distributed on the flanks, and along the whole front of the army; H, the park of artillery; I, a bridge intrenched, to secure the communication between the army and the ground on the left; K, villages and farm houses, guarded by detachments of hussars and light infantry, to patrol in front of the army.\n\nIn Plate DXLIX, are shown other methods of intrenching a camp in the neighbourhood of a town or village, and in situations where the camp can be protected by inundations. Fig. 1. represents an intrenched camp in the neighbourhood of a town. A, a deep marshy valley, with an unfordable rivulet across it. B, a redoubt constructed on a mountain, by which the right wing is appuyed. C, a small wood in front of the mountain. D, a line which connects two fleches together at the foot of the mountain, where the village of Weilheim is situated.

Q, a redoubt on a small eminence, constructed for the purpose of covering the opening behind the left wing of the camp. R, a line of communication from the last redoubt to the left of the intrenchment. S, several passages 30 feet broad and closed in by chevaux-de-frise, to afford an opportunity for the cavalry to advance, should the enemy be foiled in his attack against any part of the works.

Camp, with the several dykes in front, which are calculated to produce inundations. The spaces between these dykes are called coffins, viz. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nWe have mentioned the works by which field posts are fortified, and which are usually called redoubts. As the construction of redoubts is generally a work of the moment, and falls within the province of the commanding officer of a detachment, it is proper that we should here describe the most useful and expeditious methods of raising such works. These methods are illustrated by the plans in the upper part of Plate DL.\n\nFig. 1. shows the plan of the ordinary square redoubt which is constructed in the following manner: When a proper spot has been chosen, a line AE is drawn of sufficient length, and at one extremity a is drawn AC perpendicular to it. Then from a towards C and E are set off the dimensions proposed for each side of the parapet within the fort, allowing 2 or 2\u00bd fathoms for 30 men, 4 fathoms for 50, and so in proportion for a greater number. These lines being ascertained, a picket is placed at C, with a cord attached to it, and with the length AC described an arch, and from the point E, with the same distance, another arch is described, intersecting the former in F. Then joining EF and CF, the square forming the inner parapet is completed. Within this square, at the distance of 2 or 3 feet, is described another square I, L, M, N, having its sides parallel to those of the former. This marks the breadth of the banquette, where the men are to be drawn up. Again, on the outside of the first square at about 8 or 9 feet distance is drawn a third square O, P, Q, R, determining the outer side and thickness of the parapet. This thickness is only calculated to resist musket balls; as, if it is to stand against cannon, it should be at least 18 feet. Lastly, at rather a greater distance from this third square is drawn a fourth S, T, V, X, marking the breadth of a ditch that is to surround the redoubt.\nThe lines being finished, fascines or faggots of brushwood are to be laid between the two innermost squares, as a foundation to support the earth of the banquette; a second range is laid on the lines AB, GH, to support the inside of the parapet, and a third on the square O, P, Q, R, to strengthen the outside of the parapet, leaving a space through all the fascines to the ditch, on the side least exposed to the enemy, as at B, for an entrance. It is sometimes convenient to make this entrance take a winding direction, as is shown at T, fig. 2.\n\nFig. 3. exhibits a section of these works, where AB is the breadth of the ditch at the top; MN its breadth at the bottom; FN its slope, on a line with the outside of the parapet, called the scarp, and GM its slope towards the open country called the counter-scarp. AL and ID represent the fascines forming the outer and inner slopes of the parapet, the interval between them being filled with earth trodden down hard. At E is the banquette. DC is the thickness of the parapet below, and IL its thickness above, which forms a slope for the more convenient firing of musketry.\n\nIn this square redoubt it is evident that the men must fire straight forward in lines perpendicular to the sides of the squares, as in fig. 4. As it is often of great consequence that the directions of firing should cross each other, the better to flank the enemy, the banquette is sometimes formed with angles, as in fig. 5, so that the men may stand two together in little redans. As, however, such a construction takes up too much time and labour for ordinary occasions, M. Le Cointe prefers a circular redoubt, such as is represented at fig. 6, where the men may fire from every part of the circumference. The construction of such a redoubt is extremely simple, and differs only in its first step, viz. describing the concentric circles, which is done with a cord fastened at one end by a picket at a central point C.\n\nThe strength of the redoubt will be much increased, if the ditch can be filled with water, as by turning into it the stream of a rivulet. See Q, fig. 7. If the ground be uneven, so that the water will not run equally into every part of the ditch, dams must be raised, as C, to keep up the water in the higher parts, whence it may run to the lower, after the former are full.\n\nFig. 7. represents a plan of the square redoubt, with a wet ditch, when completed. A, the inner ground of the redoubt; B, the bottom of the ditch; CDE, the dam of earth; F a dam of boards, planks or fascines; G the upper part of the redoubt, made with fascines or with earth thrown out of the ditch; H, the lower part of the redoubt cut into the earth; I, the berme or space left at the outer bottom of the parapet, to keep up the earth; L, the entrance of the redoubt; M, the inside of the parapet; N, the outside of the parapet; O, the banquette; P, the glacis; Q, the river introduced to fill the ditch with water.\n\nThe attack and defence of posts are among the most important departments of what the French call la petite-guerre, and in a country where fortified towns are rare, constitute a considerable part of field operations. We shall consider them rather more at large than we have the preceding parts of military tactics.\n\nWhen an officer is detached either to attack or to guard a post, he should provide himself with a cord regularly divided, for the purpose of describing lines, and raising temporary works, and should procure a skilful and confidential guide, from whom he may derive the requisite information respecting the nature of the country, and the breadth and goodness of the roads. He should dispose his party in such a manner that an advanced guard of cavalry, as A, fig. 8. Plate DL, should set out first, preceded by a small detachment of about six horsemen, headed by a corporal, as B, C, C; two horsemen in the middle, and two on each side. While the main body is moving along the principal road, as from H to F, a detachment of about 8 or 12 horsemen, according to the strength of the corps, should be sent about 50 paces on each side, by way of wings, as DD; and from each of these wings 2 men should keep 50 paces farther out, as at EE, by which means the country will be properly examined, and surprises from the enemy prevented. On coming near a wood, as at NN, the cavalry should spread, the better to scour the outskirts and the wood itself. When the corps is numerous, the cavalry should be formed into squadrons, as G, G, G, and the infantry into platoons, as F, F, F, marching alternately along the road.\n\nIf, on the march, the advanced guard come to a cross road, or the entrance of a hollow way, as at I, I, where it is likely they may be met by a party of the enemy, they should immediately prepare for an attack; and if the commander of the main body observe his advanced guard in action, he should immediately draw off his platoons of infantry, and form them on the side of the road, as at L, L, L, or on some neighbouring height, as at M, M, that they may be out of the way of the enemy's cavalry, and ready to engage if occasion should require it.\n\nOn the march the party should carefully avoid villages, and rather halt or refresh his men in a wood, or some other concealed spot.\n\nThe commander of a detached party must take the safest and most effectual methods to reconnoitre the country through which he is to pass, without being observed or suspected by the enemy. The method of doing this recommended by M. Jeney will frequently succeed, and is as follows: He supposes himself with his party at Soest in Westphalia A (fig. 2. Plate DLL), and the enemy posted at Berwick B, two leagues from him. To know the situation of this place without flinging from Soest, he takes the map of the country; and from Soest as the centre, he draws a circle, whose circumference passes half a league beyond Berwick. He draws a circle of the same size upon a leaf of paper, to make his plan, as in fig. 2. and then places Soest in the centre A, and marks all the villages which he finds in the map near the circumference upon his plan, with the distances and bearings as they are represented in the map, making use of a pencil to mark the places DDD, so as to correct the errors more easily which the map may have led him to make.\n\nHaving thus formed his plan, with a scale of two leagues, he goes to the burgomaster of the town of Soest, where he causes some of the most intelligent inhabitants to come, and speaking to them freely and openly, induces them to communicate all the information for which he has occasion.\n\nThe better to conceal his designs, he begins his reconnoitring by Brockhoven, a village distant from the enemy. He asks the distance from Soest to Brockhoven;\nfen; if they say it is a league and three-fourths, he corrects the distance of his plan, which made it two leagues; then he informs himself of all that is to be found on the road from Soest to Brockhufen, chapels, housetops, woods, fields, orchards, rivers, rivulets, bridges, mills, &c. If they say that a league from Soest they pass the village of Kinderking, he marks that place upon his plan. He asks if the road from Soest to Kinderking be crossed by any other road; if there be any morals or heath; if the road be inclosed, paved, or straight; if there be any bridges to pass, and at what distance. He takes care to mark every thing on his plan, forgetting nothing, even to mills, butties, gibbets, gullies, fords, and every thing that can be got from their information; which will probably be perfect, because one always knows more than another. He continues his questions from Kinderking to Brockhufen, and advancing by little and little, observes the same method on the roads of the other villages round, marked DDD. In this manner he cannot fail to acquire an entire knowledge of all the places; besides, he finds himself imperceptibly instructed in the position of the enemy, by seeing the different routes by which he can approach with the greatest security.\n\nFor the attack of an enemy's post, such men should be selected as are brave, cool, and experienced; or if the affair require a considerable number, the detachment should be divided into platoons, some composed of picked men for the real attack, and others of ordinary soldiers for feints. The men should be provided, besides their arms, with such instruments as may be necessary for pulling down or scaling the enemy's works, such as shovels and pickaxes for fascine parapets; hatchets or pallifades, for chevaux de frise, and scaling ladders for stone or brick work. Having made the proper disposition for his attack, and procured the necessary guides, the commander of the detachment should set out in the night, so as to be at the place of attack two or three hours before daybreak, taking care to march with as little noise or parade as possible.\n\nIf the post to be attacked be an ordinary redoubt, such as we have described in No. 25, on hearing the signal previously agreed on, all the divisions are to rise at once from the place where they should have lain concealed; the first ranks should leap into the ditch, and soon after the second should follow, and both together assist in undermining the angles of the escarp, or cutting away the stakes which may impede their progress. If the parapet be faced with stone or brick work, care should be taken that the ladders be not too short, and great expedition should be used in mounting them, and especially in following the leading men in the assault, if they should be knocked down by the fire of the enemy.\n\nShould the ditch be filled with water, and too deep to be waded, it may be crossed on temporary bridges made of planks, supported on empty casks, or the ditch may be filled up with casks full of earth. If, as often happens, the ground be obstructed with caltrops, these must be swept away by dragging trees with their leaves and branches over the ground (A).\n\nIn attacking posts of considerable magnitude, such as villages, it is best to divide the attack, and to make a feint on those parts which seem best defended, while the true attacks are reserved for those situations which seem most difficult of access, and where consequently, the enemy is least upon his guard. As soon as part of the village has been carried, some divisions of the detachment should hasten to strengthen their position, by posting themselves of some church, or high ground, from which they annoy the enemy.\n\nWhen a post is once occupied, if it be thought of sufficient consequence to retain it, the best methods should immediately be taken to protect it against an attack of the enemy. The infantry to remain under arms in the middle of the place, the cavalry to patrol without, while the commanding officer, escorted by a dozen horsemen, goes to examine the environs to make his arrangements; having sent several small detachments before, to cover him in time of reconnoitring.\n\nHaving remarked the places proper for his guard, defence and retreat, as well as the dangerous ones by which the enemy can make approaches secretly to surprise him, he should choose the most convenient in the front of his post to fix his grand guard D, (fig. 1, Plate DLI.), which must face the enemy. He must mark the heights for this guard to place their vedettes EEEE, and regulate the number according to the exigencies of the situation. In a covered country you must not be sparing of them, and must reinforce every guard. At 50 paces from the front of the grand guard a non-commissioned officer with eight horsemen should be always ready to set out at K, to go and reconnoitre, when the vedettes have observed any party.\n\nIf the post to be defended be merely a redoubt, it will be proper to keep in readiness a number of trees cut down with their branches, to stop up any breaches made by the enemy's shot. The men employed in the defence should stand in three ranks, the front and centre ranks with fixed bayonets, and the third rank provided with long pikes, so as to project as far as the bayonets of the front rank. On the enemy's approach, the men should reserve their fire till the enemy come up to the glacis, and the rear rank should be furnished with hand grenades, or lighted faggots, to throw among the enemy, when they attempt to scale the parapet.\n\nIn the defence of a village or small town, guards should be posted at the entrance of the principal streets; trenches should be cut across the streets, and cannon planted behind them, while a detachment of cavalry should occupy the market place, or broadest street, to attack the enemy, if they force an entrance. If the advanced guards are driven in, they should retire with coolness and deliberation, defending their posts from house to house, till proper support can be given them from the body of the detachment.\n\nIf there be any dangerous place capable of covering the approaches of the enemy in the environs of the post,\n\n(A) The principal engines employed in the attack of posts, are represented in Plate DLV., to which we shall presently refer.\nand out of the circuit of the patroles, there should be a guard placed there, more or less strong according to the importance of the place, and care should be taken to preserve the communication. The guards and picquets being placed, the detachment that was sent out on the roads must be called in, and then go to work to lodge the party in the gardens that open upon the country, and the commanding officer's quarters; beating down hedges, filling up ditches, and levelling a piece of ground large enough to draw up the whole corps. The horses to be put under cover in barns contiguous to the gardens; but in case there are no barns, they may substitute sheds open on one side, that the horses may go out together in case of an alarm. The officers should occupy the houses in the neighbourhood of the sheds, and one of each company remain day and night with the company, to prevent any of the men from entering the village without leave, upon any pretence. The commanding officer must acquaint the officers of his having chosen the place M for the rendezvous in case of a retreat; which ought to be at some distance from the village, and on the side he judges most convenient for retiring to the army. At sunset the grand guard are to return to the post and join the picquet, the half of each to mount alternately till daybreak, and then the grand guard to return to the place which they posted the day before. The sentries and vedettes should be doubled, and all the pavilions shut up with wagons placed in two rows, except one for falling out at in case of a retreat, made wide enough for the passage of the patrols or the whole cavalry.\n\nThe corporals of the ordinary guard should lead the relief of the vedettes every hour, setting off together; but when they come to the passage of the post A, they must separate into two parties, the one to the right to relieve the vedettes BBB, the other to the left for the vedettes CCC; then each of them with the parties they have relieved should go on at their head a quarter of a league by the two routes pointed out in the plan, to examine the environs, supposing an hour to each. Besides this reconnoitring, the captain of the grand guard should send two patroles in the night. To fill up the intervals, they should set one about half an hour after the corporals, and make the same round.\n\nIn defensive operations in an open country, the fortifying of a village or a church-yard may often prove of importance, as such posts well defended may obstruct the movements of the enemy, and give time for a sufficient force to collect to meet them in the field. We shall therefore describe the most approved mode of strengthening these positions.\n\nWhen it is proposed to fortify a village, inquiry should first be made respecting the surrounding country, whether there are woods, hills, or rivers near the village, whether the roads be accessible, whether provisions can be easily obtained, &c. If the village is to be occupied as a post of defence merely, the woods, rivers, ravines, or heights, may afford advantageous outposts or situations for batteries or ambuscades; but if it is to be posted as an advanced post on the eve of a battle, the woods next the army should be cut down, the hollows filled up, and everything removed which may obstruct the free communication between the village and the main army; while on the side of the enemy, every obstruction by works, trees, &c., should be thrown in the way of his approach. The roads should be broken up or intersected with deep ditches.\n\nIf there be good hedges or deep roads parallel to the village, or in such a situation as to front the enemy, these will serve as breastworks, and for shelter. The hedges should be cut down to within four feet of the bottom, their tops sloping towards the country, and deep ditches should be dug in front. If the roads are deep, banqueting or flaps must be thrown up next the hedge to raise the men to the proper height for firing. For want of such natural means of defence, it will be necessary to throw up intrenchments on the side next the enemy and on the flanks.\n\nFig. I, Plate DLII, will explain the method of doing this in a village, under ordinary circumstances. The village stands in a plain, and in front of the army, which is distant from it about 600 paces, a. The front of the intrenchment consists of three fleches or arrows, b, c, d, joined together by lines. There are wolf-holes before the works that cover the left flank e; the line g, which crosses some swampy grounds, is broken in several places i; and the grove of wood l, is cut down, to prevent the enemy from approaching under cover of it. As the right flank, consisting of a level plain, is more exposed than any other quarter, in addition to the works made of earth, which are thrown up at m, trees are collected, and heaped up in the form of an abattis, n. These are defended by a discharge of musketry from the intrenchments, whose lines are raised as high as possible behind the growing hedges o, which inclose the gardens. It has however been judged necessary to throw the works up in a forward position p, and to have an interval between them and the hedges, lest the houses should be set on fire by the enemy, and the troops be exposed to it. Every thing is left clear and open at the back of the village, in order to secure a free intercourse with head-quarters.\n\nOther measures, however, must be adopted in the fortifying of villages which lie at so great a distance from the camp, that the enemy might surprise and take possession of them before any succours could be sent; for in that case, intrenchments must be thrown up throughout the whole of their circumference. If, on the contrary, one of the wings of the army should be supported by such a post, it would be more judicious to put the flank in a state of defence, and to lengthen the works in that quarter, to prevent the enemy from turning it.\n\nIf it should be judged expedient, under the circumstances of the army being cantoned, to fortify a village which lies in a plain, other means must be used; for in that case there would not be troops enough to defend it. Should there be a sufficiency of men, intrenchments must be thrown up in the manner we have described, and fleches must be adopted to cover them behind, with lines to connect the vacant intervals; but if there be a scarcity of soldiers, nothing but what is absolutely necessary must be done; for it is highly impolitic to attempt more than can be easily defended. Under these circumstances you must be satisfied with erecting small works, or using barricadoes to mask the entrances; here and there likewise fleches must be constructed, whose communication will be kept up by the garden hedges. If the village should stand on an eminence, it may...\nmay be fortified with more facility, and many things may be omitted, as the natural situation is itself a respectable post.\n\nShould there be a very great disproportion between the extent of the village, and the number of men intended for its defence, and the latter should be too small, a part only must be fortified, and the remainder of the houses must be secured by lines. Sometimes indeed it is found necessary to burn or destroy them, to prevent the enemy from approaching the fortified parts, under cover of the buildings.\n\nBut if the garrison should not be sufficiently strong even to defend a part of the village, you must be contented with fortifying the church and church-yard, or the cattle, if there be one. If any of these posts be thought defensible, troops must occupy them on the first alarm; but this must be done in perfect safety, and without the soldiers being exposed to be cut off on their march. This precaution is above all others necessary where villages are so long and open that the cavalry may enter them at every opening. On this account the ordinary roads and avenues must not only be obstructed, but the garden hedges must be repaired, and every opening must be closed, which may be easily done by driving stakes into the earth, and nailing boards across them, which will prevent any sudden irruption of the cavalry, from which alone any danger is to be apprehended on occasions of this sort; for the infantry would scarcely advance, except by surprise, before the garrison could occupy its station. If any apprehensions are formed of an attack, the soldiers must not be absent from their post, either in the dark of the evening, or at night; they must, on the contrary, be assembled in the intrenchments during that period, to be ready in the neighbouring houses, always clothed and accoutred.\n\nA church and church-yard afford an admirable post of defence, especially if, as usually happens, they are seated on an elevation. In fortifying such a post, we should first block up every road and byway leading to it, by means of waggons or carts, with their wheels taken off and loaded with dung or earth; trees laid across, or chevaux de frise. The narrow paths may be barricaded with rails, with their points standing upwards, and a little outwards, having behind them thick branches of trees, or logs of wood, with a ditch in front. These previous precautions being taken, the doors of the church should be pierced in several places, about eight feet from the bottom, with holes large enough to admit the muzzle of the musket, and platforms should be raised with steps within for the men to fire from. Other loop holes should be made at the bottom of the doors, just above the level of the ground, and a ditch must be dug within, about three feet deep, so as to admit of men firing from thence through these lower loop-holes. See fig. 2. The doors must also be secured by barricades, consisting of palliades driven several feet into the ground, and set extremely thick, some being deeper than others, so as to leave spaces between them and the top for loop-holes. See a, fig. 3. This barricade is technically called tambour. The walls of the church must also be pierced in various places as directed for the doors, see fig. 3, and ditches must be dug within them, and scaffolding erected as before.\n\nAgain, on the outside of the church, a ditch is to be dug as close to the walls as is consistent with safety to the foundation, about 12 feet in breadth at the top, and four in depth; and from the further side of this ditch the ground should be gradually sloped towards the open country. Through the main door of the church an opening should be made about two feet above the ground, sufficiently large to admit of one man passing through without much difficulty, so that when the churchyard becomes untenable, the garrison may retreat into the church.\n\nIt must not be forgotten to secure the means of a cross fire. If the church be built in the form of a cross, cross firings may be easily procured through the proper loop-holes; but when this is not the case, loop-holes should be made through every salient angle of the building, or tambours, such as represented in fig. 3, must be formed wherever it can be conveniently done.\n\nMen must be distributed in the upper part of the building. These men will take out the tiles or slates in different places, in order to observe the approaches of the enemy, and to fire upon him when he comes within musket-shot. The lower windows of the tower or steeple must likewise be barricaded, and have loop-holes made in them. The pavement of the church must be taken up, and the stones or bricks be carried to the top of the building, to enable the besieged to let them drop upon the enemy, when he gets sufficiently near. In order to render the defence as practicable as possible, you must also collect some large barrels or tubs, and keep them constantly at hand filled with water, for the purpose of extinguishing any fire which might break out in the church, or be effected by the enemy's shells.\n\nFig. 4 shows a plan of the church and church-yard thus fortified. a, a, a, a, the wall of the church-yard; b, c, tambour work in front of the entrances; d, the church; e, f, tambour work constructed opposite the doors; g, the sacrificial or vestry.\n\nConnected with the attack and defence of posts is the subject of ambuscades, which we must now briefly consider.\n\nAmbuscades may be formed in any place where a party may lie concealed, to surprise the enemy in passing. They are easily carried into execution in woods, hollow places, and large deserted buildings; but the placing of an ambuscade in any situation requires previous accurate information with respect to the movements of the enemy. When the commander of a party has been directed to form an ambuscade, to surprise a convoy of artillery, baggage, or provisions, or a body of recruits going to reinforce the enemy, he should first make every necessary inquiry respecting the route which the enemy is to take; the situation of the places near which he is to pass, and the post to which he is about to march. He must also inquire with seeming anxiety about the roads which lead in an opposite direction, on which he should seem more intent than on his main object. Having concerted his plan, he should set out at the head of his detachment if possible, and leaving his post on the side opposite to his true route, the better to conceal his design. If the place where he intends to plant his ambuscade be not far distant, he should come into his true route about half way, and there place half his infantry in ambush to favour his retreat. But where the country where he proposes going is distant, and the march...\nmarch requires at least two nights, he must conduct his party by meandering from wood to wood, if there be any. He must not forget to provide necessary refreshments for the day, which must be passed in some concealed place where he may not be perceived, and must cause three rations of oats to be carried for each horse.\n\nProper precautions having been taken to guard any cross road or bridge that may lie near the place of ambuscade, the commanding officer should take care to be at least two hours before the enemy, and to place the ambuscade on that side, by which, if worsted, he may retire with the greatest safety.\n\nPlate DLIII. fig. 2 will illustrate the proper method of laying an ambuscade. A represents the infantry of the surprising party, which ought to be placed at least 600 paces behind B, the cavalry, so that, if pursued, they may both fall back to A, and make good their retreat to the guard at the bridge or cross road; or to another party of infantry placed in ambush half way. If the ambuscade be placed in a wood, an intelligent non-commissioned officer should be chosen to get upon a high tree C, from which he can see the march of the enemy, and give notice of the most essential circumstances. The first of these is the seeing the advanced guard; the second is the approach of the corps, and the third is the time when their front is advanced as far as the ambuscade B; for which the commanding officer should instruct the observer what signals he is to make from the top of the tree, to communicate the necessary information without speaking, which may be done by means of a small cord D, of a brown or green colour, so as to be least perceptible. Let this cord be placed as in the plan, so that no branch interrupt it, with one end in the hand of the observer, and the other in the commanding officer's hand in the ambuscade B.\n\nAs soon as the advanced guard appears, the observer must pull the cord, and the commanding officer cause the party to mount and remain in deep silence. If by a stratagem, which is practised for particular reasons, the advanced guard is immediately followed by the corps, which may be easily known by their being more numerous than ordinary, and not followed by any other corps, that the commander may not be deceived by the enemy, the cord should be drawn a second time, and a third time when their front is advanced as high as the ambuscade. At that instant the party must rush out, and furiously attack the flanks of their centre in the following manner.\n\nIf the advanced guard E is formed only of an ordinary number, they should be allowed to pass; and at the approach of the principal part or convoy F, the chief to be informed by the second pulling of the cord. At the moment the head of the convoy shall be advanced as high as B, the cord must be pulled the third and last time; and at this signal the party must rush out without being perceived, and suddenly attack the centre on the flank, engaging only with their swords, and making such a noise as to prevent the enemy from hearing the orders of their officers. They must disarm all whom their bravery shall throw in their way, taking care not to scatter or pursue too far, unless it be certain that they are so far from their army or parties, on account of which they cannot be affected; for in either of these cases they will not fail to run at the noise, and disturb the retreat.\n\nIn all secret expeditions, great circumspection should be used, that the party be not seen or betrayed; as if they be discovered by the advanced guard before the blow be struck, the enterprise must be immediately abandoned, and the party retire. When the guide, or any one of the party deserts, and cannot be caught, a retreat must immediately be thought of, or the ambuscade must be placed somewhere else; but to prevent such a misfortune, the officers should be charged to examine frequently whether they have all their men.\n\nAn ambuscade should never be formed for cutting off the enemy's retreat, as this will drive him to despair, and make him rally and attack the party with desperate resolution. There may be an exception to this, when it is pretty certain that the whole party of the enemy may be cut off or taken prisoners, either from the smallness of their number, or from the peculiar situation of the place of ambuscade.\n\nSeveral ambuscades should not be formed at once, except for the purpose of seizing foragers, in which case they should be disposed so that the sentinels may see from one to another. Then the first guard which sees the foragers, should commence the attack, and can soon be assisted by the rest of the party.\n\nIn all ambuscades, no sentinels should be placed but officers or non-commissioned officers. On downs, behind mountains, or in gullies, the sentinels should lie with their bellies on the ground, and their feet towards the ambuscade, the body covered with a gray or green cloak, according to the colour of the ground, with their heads a little raised and wrapped in a handkerchief of straw green colour, or white in time of snow, so as not to be easily perceived. The number of sentinels cannot be determined, but they should be disposed so as to watch on all sides of the ambuscade, and stop every one who may inadvertently approach too near. The sentinels should give notice of what they discover by gestures, to which all the officers should be very attentive. In countries where there are no woods, vineyards, or hedges, an ambuscade may be placed in a field of hemp or corn, or some sort of grain, provided it be high enough to cover the men, at least with the help of art. When the stalks of the corn is not high enough, some of the infantry must be set to work with spades and pickaxes, which they must have brought along with them, for the purpose of digging holes in the field deep enough to make up for the defective height of the corn.\n\nAn ambuscade often forms part of a stratagem for bringing on an action with a party of the enemy which would be superior, were it not for some advantage of this kind, as in the following case. See Plate DLIII. fig. 1. Suppose the whole party to set out from A, marching under the conduct of a trusty guide by covered ways at a distance from the enemy. Being come to the place C, which ought to be in the environs, and as high as the field of battle, the infantry should be concealed out of the road far from the sight of passers-by. This must be the centre of correspondence with the army; the rendezvous of the booty, and support the retreat of all the cavalry, of which there should be as many detachments as there are attacks proposed to be made. We shall suppose six of 100 men each, and they must\nmust go secretly by particular routes to their respective posts, E, D, F, G, H, I. Neither trouble nor expense should be spared to procure good guides. Each detachment should lie in ambush half a league, if necessary, from the object of the attack BKKKK.\n\nThe noise of the musketry in the armies is to be the signal for their irruption; and then bravery, intrepidity, and courage will give wings to the people. The second detachment D will glance imperceptibly between the villages, and fall like thunder on the camp B; and while 89 attack all whom they meet, the other 20 should light their torches at the fires that are to be found everywhere, and spread the flames rapidly to the straw of the tents. As they cannot fail to have the picket of the camp soon at their heels, they must strike their blow with all possible expedition, without stopping to plunder, being content with the glory of having excited a general alarm, capable of confounding the whole army, and contributing to the gaining of a battle.\n\nAt the same time that the detachment D attacks the camp B, the others, E, F, G, H, must with equal violence attack the villages K, K, K, which they have in front, doing the same the first did in camp, except that they may seize as plunder every thing which they can conveniently carry off, with which these villages are commonly filled, seizing the best horses, hamstringing others with the stroke of a sword, and setting fire to all the places which contain the enemy's baggage. Each detachment should cause some horsemen to advance beyond the village, to observe the motion of the troops, who will not fail to run to their assistance. As soon as they perceive them, they must make their retreat as fast as possible by the routes which the commanding officer has preconcerted, and which are represented in the plate by the course lines. The fifth detachment I, in ambush on the side of the road leading from the camp, should remain there, to seize all the enemy who think of saving themselves by flight.\n\nWhen the commander of a detachment finds himself obliged to abandon a post, or that it is not worth defending, it becomes necessary for him to prepare for his retreat. This is often a difficult and dangerous affair, and requires much prudence as well as bravery on the part both of officers and men. If possible, he should retreat on that side which forms a communication with the general basis or line of posts occupied by his party. The following observations on lines of retreat, connected with the lines of operation described in No 22, will be found of importance.\n\nA retreat on a single line is a fault of the utmost magnitude, for it is evident that if the army C (fig. 8, Plate DXLVI.) retire from it towards B, along the line A.B., the enemy may send besides, two corps a, d, against the flanks of this army, which would separate it at the point B, and in this case it would be surrounded. Nor is this the only disadvantage, for all the country situated to the right and left of the line A.B., would fall into the hands of the enemy; while, in a retreat, it is always a rule to cover as much of the country as possible.\n\nA concentric retreat is of such a nature, that in an extensive position they fall back to one more confined, so that the two lines of operation at the extremities A.B., (fig. 9,) unite at the object of retreat C, forming an acute angle, or as at fig. 10, an obtuse angle; such a retreat would have no better issue than the former. The same disadvantages which result from retreats on a single line would likewise attend this. There is one circumstance which might induce a general to retreat in this manner, and that is, with the view of covering any important place, a capital, for example, by taking an advantageous position, which is indicated by C, in the figures; the important place required to be covered would probably be at D. But nevertheless this measure would be ineffectual if the enemy were at all versant in the art of war, and operated on the flanks of the army they were pursuing. The best method of covering a country, which is in our rear, is to proceed against the flanks of the enemy which is advancing; and by this intrepid and bold movement, to change our defensive operations into those of an attack.\n\nA retreat conducted in parallel lines, as the basis A.B., Fig. 12, in four corps, 1, 2, 3, 4, or the lines A.C, E.G, F.H, B.D, is doubtless better than the concentric retreats which we have just considered. In the first place, the country is better covered by means of the parallel lines; secondly, the enemy cannot so easily infall the flanks of the retreating army, provided that this is in a condition to perform the same manoeuvre with regard to them, and thus obstruct their progress; lastly, they would be afraid of advancing with too much precipitation, from the moment their attention is divided by the attempt which may be made against them. But there might be something still better attending it, viz. to retire in an eccentric direction, as we shall show presently.\n\nThe excellence of parallel retreats is maintained from the idea that they cover a country better, and likewise stop the progress of an enemy, when opposed in a direct line. Certainly this appears evident to the eye; but the fight is often the medium only of error. It is the ignis fatuus which leads us into the mire, and the present instance is a proof of it. This opinion was not indeed well founded among our predecessors, and still less is it among the moderns. We do not now arrest the progress of the enemy, by presenting ourselves to their strongest part, viz. their front; but on the contrary, by intercepting their flanks, which are the weakest parts; by harassing their rear; by menacing their provisions and their communication with the sources of their vigour and power. It follows from hence, that eccentric retreats are the best. An army (fig. 12,) who retires from a, b, c, d, e, towards f, g, h, i, k, runs no risk of seeing the enemy advance in the segment f, k; for he would, by such a movement, be in danger of being surrounded.\n\nWe may lay it down as a rule, that it is essentially necessary, in all retreats, to divide into different columns, in order to divert the attention of the enemy; and it is fully demonstrated that there is not in war a more important maxim. We might show that this method of attracting the attention of the enemy to many different points at once is, properly speaking, exciting a degree of apprehension with regard to his flanks and rear. But it naturally results from all that has been said relative to the inutility of diverging offensive operations, as well as those which are directed by a single line, or by an acute angle, that eccentric retreats are of all others the most preferable. Since concentric operations are the most advantageous in attacking, eccentric ones must necessarily possess the same advantages in defence; everything...\nthing should be in opposition, in two different kinds of warfare, which are in their nature and interests contradictory.\n\nIn conducting a retreat, as in all other field operations, an army should assume, as the principal object, its own magazines, and the safety of its lines of convoy, rather than the army of the enemy; and it should never take a position opposite the enemy, but rather on one side of him.\n\nWe have hitherto considered military operations in the field, as they are subservient, or preparatory to, that most important consequence of war, a battle. We must now examine what are the causes which should induce a general to hazard or avoid a battle; and if he determine on a general action, what are the best methods of disposing the troops under his command.\n\nAt present, actions in the field are distinguished into two kinds, according as they are more or less general. When the whole of the adverse armies are engaged, it is called a battle; but where only a part of each is concerned, a combat. The latter of these, however desperate, does not in general involve such important consequences as the former; but as in a general engagement, the vanquished party usually lose the greater part of their artillery and baggage, and are compelled to retire and leave the country behind them at the mercy of the victors, a prudent general never hazards such losses without important reasons.\n\nWhen an army is superior to its opponents in number or discipline; when discord prevails among the chiefs of the adverse army; when a neglect of the ordinary precautions in marching, encamping, or other obvious duties, demonstrate their incapacity; when it is necessary to relieve a considerable town or post that is besieged by the enemy; when it is apprehended that the army will be dispersed or ruined, without a general engagement; when intelligence has been received that reinforcements are approaching to the enemy, which will render him superior; when the enemy has received, in some preceding action, a considerable check which he has not yet recovered, or when the army whose general is thus canvassing the advantages and disadvantages of a battle, is in such a state, that every thing ought to be hazarded for its relief, the commander is warranted in giving battle to the enemy.\n\nOn the contrary, when less is to be hoped for from a victory than feared from a defeat; when the army is inferior either in number, courage, or discipline, to the enemy; when it is in expectation of being reinforced by a strong detachment of fresh troops; when the enemy is so advantageously posted that it would be impossible to bring him to an engagement on equal terms, or to force his entrenchments; or when there is a prospect, by temporizing and declining battle, of ruining the army of the enemy by disease, famine, or defection, it would be wrong to place the fortune of the campaign on the issue of a battle.\n\nWhen a general engagement has been resolved on, for a battle, the general is to devise the means of carrying it into execution, so as to have the strongest presumption of success. He is to arrange, with the officers of his staff, the manner in which the troops are to be divided and disposed, or what is called the order of battle; he should assign to his several officers their respective parts, and see that copies of the order of battle be given to those that have a separate command. The proper officers should take care that the troops under their command be properly armed and equipped, and that they are allowed time to rest and refresh themselves before the engagement. The heavy baggage, and every thing that might encumber the operations of the troops, should be removed, and placed at a distance under a proper guard. A reserve should be formed near the park of artillery, consisting of some of the bravest and best disciplined troops, headed by the most experienced officers.\n\nIn time of action, the commander-in-chief should be circumstantially situated as to be able to issue his orders with the least possible difficulty; and to observe as far as possible the operations attended to during the engagement, and especially the effects of the first attack. Every other general officer must keep his own station, to direct the charge of the troops, or to rally and re-form those which have been routed and dispersed. When the action becomes general, and is obstinately contested, the commander-in-chief should direct the principal efforts of his troops against that part of the enemy's line which makes the greatest resistance, and should himself hasten to this spot, to animate his men to greater activity and exertion by his presence and exhortations.\n\nThe artillery of the army should accompany the first line, and the remainder of the troops should follow the movements of those before them, so as to preserve the proper distance between the lines, and march with the least possible disorder and confusion. If the first line give way, the second should march up to its relief, and either charge the enemy, or keep him employed till the first line has time to rally and re-form. If, however, as often happens, the other lines are struck with a panic on observing the repulse of their predecessors, the reserve should be brought up, and it is probable that their courage and resolution will reanimate the scattered troops, and turn the fortune of the day.\n\nIn forming the order of battle, regard must be paid to the nature and situation of the place where the battle is to be fought; to the number and quality of the troops engaged, and to the mode of fighting which is most likely to take place during the action, or to decide the victory. There are two principal methods of forming troops in order of battle, the column and the line. The former of these was most in use among the ancients, has been greatly recommended by Polaris in his commentaries on Polybius, and practised with the most brilliant success by the French armies since their pontentious revolution. This order of battle is adapted chiefly to cases where the activity of the troops can be relied on, and where much firing with musketry or artillery is not expected to take place, and where of course the affair is to be decided principally by the pike or the bayonet. It is also well calculated for a body of infantry who are to resist the attack of cavalry. It is obvious that from the close arrangement of troops in column, this disposition must expose them more to the fire of a line, and must endanger their being flanked or surrounded by an enemy whose front is more extended. The relative advantages and disadvantages of the column and the line, will be more readily perceived by attending to the following principles.\n\nFrom the order of battle as a basis are deduced many instructive\ninstructive principles relating to what are called lines of marching and lines of firing, which constitute a considerable part of the elements of modern tactics.\n\nThere are as many lines of marching arising from the order of battle, as there are soldiers in the first rank of the line or column, and as the soldiers approach towards the enemy, these lines of marching, at least in the infantry, produce lines of firing. It is the nature and relative advantages of different lines of marching and firing that we now propose to consider.\n\nLet us suppose two lines of troops, A and B, fig. 13, extended opposite to each other, of which A is considerably longer than B at each extremity, or, as it is termed, outflanks it. It is evident that B may be surrounded by A, as from the superior numbers of A, B may be attacked in flank and rear. It is therefore evident that when the numbers are unequal, and the contest is to be decided by firing, the greater number must prevail, if both are arranged in lines.\n\nAgain, the line AB (fig. 14.) being attacked by the line cd, the flank B cannot extend itself parallel to cd, if this line advances always in front towards A. The line attacked is surrounded, and even to prefield upon, that they must all take flight towards A. If any troops by chance should endeavour to form upon the line ef, they would not have time; taken in front and in flank by the enemy's fire, they could never resist such an attack. The cavalry would experience the same disadvantages in a similar case. Horsemen attacked to the right, to the left, and in front, could not defend themselves; the celerity of the horses, no doubt, would enable them to deploy quicker than the infantry; but, by the same reasoning, the enemy's cavalry, which is advanced upon their flank, would likewise advance the quicker from the point B, towards the opposite wing A, which a corps of infantry could not possibly do. Thus it would be equally difficult to form the line ef; everything would be overthrown, and they must retire in the greatest disorder towards A. It is hence clear that every effort should be made by an army in line of battle, to turn the enemy's flanks with its front.\n\nConcentric lines of marching and firing well executed, are exceedingly important. Hence it is that a fortress must yield when it is besieged, as the fire from the fortresses is eccentric, while that of the besiegers is concentric. Hence, too, fortresses from a garrison rarely succeed, because they are eccentric operations.\n\nWhen an army is much weaker than its opponent, if the former be compelled to an action, it should throw itself on the enemy's flanks; and to do this with effect, the enemy's front should be kept occupied, so as to draw off his attention from his flanks. If the line were long, he would have time to convey all that part opposite to the side attacked, as A (fig. 15.) into the line ef, before the attacking army cd could entirely overthrow and repulse the flank B, which would be the object of their efforts. In this case, things would again be equal; for an engagement in front would take place, the issue of which is always doubtful. If, however, they occupy the line AB, by corps sent for that purpose, as g and h, while, with a greater force, they attack in flank, then it would be impossible for any part of AB to throw themselves into the line ef, before having beaten gh; and the time would probably be too short for this operation, if cd pushed in front in a vigorous manner. From this it follows that the army AB, though the stronger, can do nothing better at this time than quit the field of battle, as it will otherwise be surrounded. Now, the attacking army have nothing to do but to effect an eccentric retreat; namely, to fall back with the left wing upon ik, and with the right upon lm, provided CD do not obstruct the passage; for in that case, the retreat of the right wing, or of that part of the army nearest the flank B, would be on n, in order to create in the enemy a some solicitude for his left flank d. It is by such eccentric retreats that the pursuit of the enemy is prevented. They dare not venture it, if they do not wish to be taken in flank themselves, and to become in their turn exposed to an escalade and a concentric fire, and consequently a terrible havoc. Eccentric retreats in tactics are equally advantageous as in strategy. The latter kind alarm the enemy with regard to his lines of operation, and consequently prevent him from advancing; the former make him afraid of exposing his flanks and rear, and hinder him from pursuing.\n\nFrom these considerations it appears that it is no great misfortune for an army to be attacked in its centre, and divided. If the army be divided in two at the centre, it will retire eccentrically on e and f (fig. 16.). By this movement it will throw an obstacle in the way of all farther progress on the part of the enemy, who has divided in the middle dotted line AB. It is impossible for the enemy cd to advance in front between e and f; they would take him in flank on both sides; he must therefore advance in front towards e and f, both at the same time. In this position e and f might detach forces to the rear of cd, and operate at once on its provisions and in its country. It would be sufficient for that to send some corps from their flanks to the points A, B. It is likewise possible for them to advance entirely to the left and right, if they have any magazines at g and h, which nevertheless would not be exposed by the marching of the flanks towards A and B, and would always be sheltered from the enterprises of cd. A third combination likewise would be to attack immediately cd, which, from its position, would be exposed on both its flanks. In this last case, cd would have no other resource than to operate on that part of the flanks e and f, which are opposite to the points A, B, to compel ef to retreat, and replace its front in the direction of A, B.\n\nIt does not require a great body of men to occupy the front of the enemy, while the rest of the army attacks the flanks. It is best done by means of a scattered troop, or what the French call tirailleurs, consisting of light infantry, which are usually instructed in the following manner. The troop, formed into two ranks, divides in such a manner that there may be a space between the two, as indicated in fig. 17. The second rank, placed behind the intervals left by the first, secures its flanks. When they attack, the second rank, CD, passing through the intervals of the first AB, advances to the line EF, and fires. The great advantage arising from this, is that of forming a more extensive front than when they are wedged in elbow to elbow; secondly, they keep up a more fatal fire with their musketry, because each soldier, being unmolested by the one next to him, aims better, and continues his firing without interruption; thirdly, a less number of men is lost, because...\nmany of the enemy's balls fall in the intervals, and are consequently harmless; but in the following method all these advantages are united in a more eminent degree.\n\nHere the dispersed soldiers do not move in right lines, but circularly, as represented in fig. 18. When the first rank has fired, the men make a little turn to the left, and run to the place occupied by the second rank, the men of which advance rapidly in front to the place which the former had quitted, and fire, while the other rank is charging. Thus, each rank alternately advancing and retiring in circles, a constant fire is kept up on the enemy, with little hazard to the men. It must be allowed, however, that this method will succeed only when the enemy stand firm; for if they fly, the former method is to be preferred.\n\nIf the attacking army be forced to retire, the tireailleurs that succeed them should stop at No. 2, fig. 19, instead of proceeding as far as No. 1; while those that are already at No. 1, in retiring, fall back farther than No. 2, thus each rank successively falling farther and farther back, contesting every inch of ground.\n\nIt may perhaps be maintained, that it is better in attack to adopt close order, because the lines of firing being more approximate, they can keep a better fire; but it may be replied, that if they are once on the flanks of the enemy, and sufficiently near to use the musket, it is then of little importance whether they attack with close ranks, or en tireailleurs, because in either case the enemy must be beaten if they charge with vigour. In such a position, it would be difficult to throw oneself in the line ef (fig. 2c.) particularly if it be occupied in front, as it ought to be, and it is necessary, that the cavalry should be near, in order to sustain this attack.\n\nThe retreats of the infantry intended to occupy the front AB (fig. 21.), need not be either eccentric or in flank, the principal object being to direct the attention of the army AB from its flanks, which it is intended to attack; but these retrograde movements must be conducted directly upon f. If the retreat be serious, and it be really intended to abandon the front AB, and to prevent the pursuit by creating in the enemy a solicitude for his flanks, then the retreat should be executed eccentrically up g h.\n\nSuppose an army collected in an oblique position, as at CD, fig. 22, and suppose it is to make an attack on another army AB, coming round upon its flank. This manoeuvre has been recommended by Folard, and was practised long ago by Epaminondas, and in modern times by Frederick the Great. It is however generally considered as inferior to the mode of attack illustrated in fig. 15, and AB might easily avoid the danger by moving along in line towards f, or taking the position Ag. Indeed AB is itself, by its right wing A, in some degree enabled to act on the offensive against the left wing of CD, by moving round in the columns h i.\n\nThe consequence of this mutual manoeuvring would be, that CD takes AB on its flank B, while it is itself taken by AB on its own flank C; the two parts attacked will be probably beaten by the attacking army, and after the combat they will both remain opposite to each other, though a little obliquely with respect to their former front.\n\nIt is not always necessary to re-form the ranks. Suppose AB (fig. 23.) is attacked by the line CD, the left wing might run dispersed towards ef, and there make a little turn to the right at a certain signal, return quickly, attack the left flank D, and give it a rolling fire from three sides, before D, in order to defend himself, could take the form of an axe (d'une hache) D3. But, in order for such an attack to succeed, the enemy's cavalry must not be near. In case there be any to be apprehended, the precaution to be adopted would be to form into columns. If, therefore, attacks and retreats take place in this manner, and, above all, if care has not been taken to sustain and cover them with a numerous cavalry, the greater part of the tactical evolutions of the infantry are rendered useless. It is, however, indispensably necessary that the troops should always know how to deploy from a column into a line of battle.\n\nCaptain R\u00f6sch, a Prussian officer, has discovered a method of deploying, which appears to be by far the easiest and the best yet known. During the march, the divisions proceeding on the line AB (fig. 24.) observe the necessary distances. As soon as the division enters into the line of direction AB, it is commanded to the right or left, according to the side which they wish to face; the following division arrives, without changing its step, to the very place where the preceding one has made its quart de conversion, and performs a similar one; the third, the fourth, and all the rest follow the example. Each division having thus traversed its distance, reaches the line of direction, when that which marches directly in front has already made room.\n\nThis method is a step further towards the perfection of deploying, which is to advance in front, for the division 1 is obliged to make a quart de conversion to the left, before presenting in front to the line, whilst, according to the method of Captain R\u00f6sch, this line is formed merely by a half-front. At the same time, a conversion is a movement which always requires many paces, because it is performed in the segment of a circle.\n\nIn the two methods of deploying represented at fig. 24. and 25., the divisions traverse the two smallest sides of a right-angled triangle (see fig. 25.). The Prussians have introduced a method, in which only the hypothenuse is described: it is called the adjutant's step. The adjutants, who know from experience the length of the front of their battalions, measure with the gallop of their horses on the line of direction, the pace necessary for appearing in battle (fig. 26.). Each battalion separates from the column, and marches by the nearest road to where their adjutants stand, at the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, as intermediate points on the line of direction AB. As soon as the first division arrives at the adjutant, it immediately deploys according to the method already described. If the officers who measure the front do not make any great mistake, the march in front must be executed much more quickly than by the preceding method.\n\nLet us now examine the best method of throwing back a wing into a line, so that it may not be turned. Suppose an oblique line at cd (fig. 27.) with a crochet de formed to prevent being taken by the flank d; and at the same time, to have a line ready to repulse every attack which the enemy AB might attempt on the left against this flank. Such is the first modification which this kind of position offers to our examination. After this line, en crochet, has dispersed everything which oppo-\nposed its progress, it turns, till it arrive at the prolongation of the oblique front CD, and then takes the enemy in flank.\n\nAt the battle of Lissa*, some battalions of grenadiers were placed at the extremity of the right wing of the cavalry; they overthrew the troops of W\u00fcrtemberg, and performed other essential services. But such a position has this defect, that it offers a flank to the enemy, which can be enfiladed by his cannon. This would happen to cd (fig. 28.), as well as ae, if the line AB extended beyond, and turned the oblique front cd. It would be possible, by means of a square battalion, as de, ef, fg, to cover the flank which is attacking in the oblique order, but two sides of this square would be enfiladed by the cannon of the enemy. The defence of a parallelogram is therefore much weaker than that of a perfect square.\n\nFig. 29. represents what the Prussians call a crenail\u00e9ri\u00e8re, a form extremely complicated and liable to be enfiladed by the enemy. Another and still more complicated form of this order of battle is seen at fig. 30.\n\nFigs. 31. and 32. represent the order of battle in a square, a form which is well adapted both to strength and convenience. When it is intended to reinforce the square battalion against cavalry, the third rank separates from the two others, and forms by itself a lesser square, within that formed by the front and centre ranks. When this is done, if the enemy's cavalry should penetrate into one of the angles of the first square, the inner square forms a salient angle by conversions to the right and left, as represented by the dotted lines fig. 32., so as by a cross fire to drive the enemy back again.\n\nMany have proposed to conduct retreats in various square battalions; but it is necessary that they should be small squares, composed at the utmost of two or three battalions; and it is requisite, that during the march, whether by angles or squares, they should observe between each other such a position, that the fire of the one flank should reach to the sides of the other in order to protect it. (fig. 33. N\u00b0 1, 2, 3.). This last battalion reaches the front 1, which last performs the same service to the rear of 3, and to the front of 2; 2, on its side, protects the rear both of 1 and 3. It would be difficult in the field, for these different squares to preserve such a compressed position, and they would be in danger of wounding or killing each other by their cross firing. Men well experienced in war have, however, preferred retreats of infantry in square battalions, having the cannon in the centre or on the flanks, as represented in fig. 34.\n\nIn executing this movement, however, the distances are scarcely ever preserved, especially when it is necessary for a wing to deploy by a conversion during a retreat, see fig. 35. In order to prevent the pursuit of the enemy. In every other respect these retreats being eccentric, are founded on good principles. See N\u00b0 33.\n\nWhen, after a discharge of musketry, an army has to retire, this movement cannot be expected to be executed in order. In this case a flight always takes place, for otherwise there would be no reason for quitting the field of battle. In this situation it is necessary to have a line of cavalry behind the infantry, to sustain them; and then it is not so bad as is generally imagined, to fly hastily into the midst of the cavalry. It is only necessary that this scattered infantry should re-form immediately, in the most convenient place, in a wood, or on an elevation; and if they return quickly to the charge, they will display more courage, than in falling back, step by step, and losing a number of men; for in the first instance it is a real and useful intrepidity, but in the second it is nothing. If there be no cavalry to sustain them in an open place, they must then remain united, or otherwise be cut in pieces.\n\nWhen it is possible to effect a regular retreat, the best and easiest method is to make a half-turn to the right with the whole line, and to march thus, progressively falling back; by this means they will sooner escape from the fire of the enemy than in any other manner, and the order is much more easily kept, which is of importance, and deserves to be properly appreciated. There is not a more pitiable object than a square battalion surrounded by tirailleurs, (fig. 36.). All their shot are concentric, and consequently eminently effective, while those of the squares are eccentric, which renders them almost nugatory. The ranks of this unhappy square would soon be thinned by a well-directed fire, which could not miss its aim; and a battalion, in this position, would find it impossible to escape destruction.\n\nThe most celebrated modification of the oblique front, is that made by Frederick the Great, viz. the oblique attack in rounds. Experience has not yet proved what there is peculiarly excellent in this manner of attacking; and Captain R\u00f6sch has shewn that it is not tenable in theory. He demonstrates that each \u00e9chelon would be received by the enemy with a superior fire; for the one cd (fig. 37.) if it approach the line AB, within musket shot, would be caught in its flank c; which being turned, and exposed to a side fire, would infallibly describe an arch in its rear, to have its adversary in front. The division of the line AB, which in this case would pour upon the flank c of the \u00e9chelon, cd, such a fatal fire, would be in no way hindered by the second ef, which is too far off to fire; and, besides, the first two divisions of the wing f dare not fire, at least not with safety, if the \u00e9chelon were 300 paces distant, for fear of reaching them in the flank c. Thus, the two divisions of the line AB, which are opposite to the \u00e9chelon, cd, would continue their fire upon the fatal rank c, without the least interruption. If they be not more than 50 or 100 paces distant, these inconveniences will not take place; but at the same time, the advantages which were expected to result from an attack en \u00e9chelon will be lost. These advantages are, that, by dividing the front, only one part is liable to be beaten, as the others would be neglected; while on the contrary, in an oblique line, without any interruption, the disorder rapidly spreads through its whole extent. It would be possible, in order to derive every advantage from this manoeuvre, to augment considerably the fire of the first \u00e9chelon, as well as the one immediately subsequent, by doubling their lines, and leaving the others weaker. Hence it is evident, that this mode of attack is eligible only when we are ahead of an enemy stronger than ourselves; for if we have a superior force, it is certain that the most energetic method would be to attack at once the adversary in front and both flanks.\n\nThere is scarcely an instance previous to the battle of Marengo, in which a second line of infantry has renewed the combat, by taking the place of the first which has been beaten. If the combat be continued with bayonets,\nbayonets, it would be sufficient for a division of the line AB to make a conversion on the flank of the echelon c d, while they are fighting in front, and overthrow it before ef, 300 paces distant, or even the second line of the echelon, could come up to afford it any assistance. Thus, according to all appearances, the line AB would conquer all the echelons successively, and this the more easily as they would be taken in flank as soon as c d is obliged to fly.\n\nThe most useful, and in fact the only process for reinforcing an attack, is to have a second line of cavalry behind a first of infantry; in case of bad success they secure and cover their retreat, and complete the disorder of the enemy's infantry, if they come to an engagement.\n\nWhen the infantry is ranged on echiquier, a first line when beaten, may retreat by files through the lines in the rear, without creating any disorder in the second, on account of the extensive spaces; but it is not the same with the long phalanx in open order. The cavalry, placed immediately behind the infantry, protects an attack much better than if there were between them a second line of infantry; for in the first instance, there would be no hindrance to their hastening to the succour of the runaways, and receiving them in their bosom. Hence there should be only two lines, one of infantry, and one of cavalry; and this is the more important, because the two lines of infantry cannot be useful, except in as far as they are beyond the shot of the cannon; it is evident, therefore, that they should be considered rather as a reserve of fresh troops than as a second line of combatants. Hence, the superadded strength which is supposed to be given to the echelons, by double lines of infantry, is quite illusory.\n\nCannons which fire concentrically, assist greatly the efficacy of an attack; but this measure may be employed as well for right lines as for the echelons; in an attack of the latter kind, the batteries should not be placed before the division c d, but before ef, to enflame that part of the line AB, which would attempt to fall back to make a conversion, in case it were attacked in flank by c d.\n\nIt is impossible to take the enemy in flank by the diagonal or side-step, executed during the march, if, previous to commencing their march, they are not already considerably by their wings; for they would completely frustrate that scheme, if they made directly with their flanks a movement to the side. During the same time they would pass over a more considerable extent of ground than with an oblique step, because they move in a direct line, and in front, and obliquely, both at the same time, which would considerably shorten their distance; and likewise because they march on one of the sides and you on the hypotenuse, which is longer. It is therefore impossible to succeed in stretching beyond the wings of the enemy, while they are advancing in front in the order of battle, if they know how to conduct themselves.\n\nThere is, however, one advantage to be noticed, which the echelons possess over the uninterrupted oblique front, which is, not exposing the flank to the enemy advancing in front. The echelons naturally possess this advantage, while the oblique front cannot obtain it without being much more extensive than the enemy's front; for the oblique line, formed into echelons, changes into a number of parallel lines by a conversion (fig. 38.), and they may, by this movement, defend their flanks against the enemy. But still the best way is to attack him in his own flanks, whilst his front is amused with detached corps, and the columns should be prepared for the principal attack out of sight of the enemy, in the same manner as an admiral adopts at a considerable distance, his measures for gaining the windward of the enemy. No manoeuvres within cannon-shot, can possibly be attended with success, if the enemy be skilful.\n\nMuch useful military instruction may be derived from Lift of repeating the accounts of the most celebrated battles, remarkable tales by writers of ancient and modern history; and we could here enumerate a long list of these engagements, many of which have been described in the historical articles of this work. A few, however, must suffice. Of ancient battles we may notice those of Marathon* in 490 B.C.; Plat\u00e6a, 479; Lepanto*, See these 371; the Granicus*, 334; Arbela*, 331; the Artaxerxes Lake\u2020, 217; Cannae*, 216; Zama*, See Carthage 202; Magnesia\u2020, 190; Nephisis, 147; Pharsalia*, See Pharsalus 113, 48; and Philippi*, 42. Of modern battles, the most important are those of Hastings*, A.D. 1066; the See Crecy Indus||, 1221; Bannockburn\u00a7, 1314; Cressy*, 1346; Poitiers*, 1356; Agincourt*, 1415; Bolsworthy*, See Scotland 1485; Flodden \u00a7, 1513; Pavia, 1525; Narva \u2021\u2021, 1621; Blenheim*, 1704; Ramillies*, 1706; Pul-tava \u2021\u2021, 1709; Malplaquet*, 1709; Fontenoy \u2020\u2020, See England, then |||, 1757; Minden, 1759; Freiburg, 1762; Jemappes\u2021\u2021 See Ref. 1792; Tilsit, 1793; Fleurus, 1794; Lodi, 1796; Zurich, 1799; Ulm, 1800; Marengo, 1800; Austerlitz, 1805; and Wagram, in 1809.\n\nBy way of illustrating the modern French tactics, and more fully explaining what has been said on the order of battle, we shall here give a detail of the battle of Jemappes, in which Dumourier entirely defeated General Clairfayt, by enticing him from a situation where he was impregnable.\n\nIn the beginning of November 1792, when Dumourier arrived with his army in the vicinity of Mons, he found the Austrian general Clairfayt occupying a strong position on the heights near the village of Jemappes, where he had entrenched himself, and was defended by nearly 100 pieces of cannon. The position of the Austrians was extremely formidable. Their right extended to the village of Jemappes, and formed a square with their front and left, which stretched to the caufeway of Valenciennes. They were posted on a woody mountain, where they had erected, in an amphitheatre, three tiers of redoubts. Their whole force amounted to about 16,000 infantry, and 3000 cavalry.\n\nThe army of Dumourier was much more numerous than that of Clairfayt, but not so well supplied with artillery. The elevation of the Austrian batteries, too, gave them such an advantage, that the French cannon could produce but little effect.\n\nOn the 5th of November, Dumourier had fully reconnoitred the Austrian camp, and, by way of feint, made an attack with his infantry on the village of Carignon, while he kept up a brisk cannonade on their left. Towards evening the French army encamped opposite to Jemappes, with its left wing extending to Hoorne, and its right to Fremeiy. As Dumourier resolved...\nsolved to make a decisive attack on the heights of Jemappes the next morning, he ordered his troops to abandon the village of Carrignon, which was commanded by the enemy's cannon.\n\nOn the morning of the 6th, he ordered his artillery to be advanced and disposed along the front of the line. It was soon found, however, that little was to be done with artillery, and that the great object was, to entice the Austrian general from his strong position, and draw him to the plain. For this purpose, at noon of the 6th, the French infantry formed in columns, and advanced with the greatest spirit and rapidity to the Austrian intrenchments. The lower tier of redoubts was instantly carried; but, as the centre of the French became endangered, and the Austrian cavalry appeared descending from the heights, and preparing to enter the plain, with an evident intention of flanking the French columns, Dumourier despatched the duke of Orleans to lead those columns against the second tier of redoubts, while a detachment of chasseurs and hussars flew to check the progress of the Austrian cavalry. Some smart skirmishing between the cavalry on both sides now ensued, and while this diversion was taking place, the left division of the French army possessed themselves of the village of Jemappes, while its centre obtained entire possession of the second tier of redoubts. In the meantime the whole of the Austrian cavalry had quitted the heights, and engaged the French on the plain below Jemappes. This was the point to which Dumourier had wished to bring them, and now the superior numbers and activity of the French quickly decided the fortune of the day. The Austrians were routed at every point, and forced to abandon the field of battle, leaving 5000 of their dead, with the greater part of their artillery. The loss of the French, however, was considerably greater, and is, on good authority, estimated at 14,000; but this loss appeared trifling to Dumourier, as by this victory he acquired possession of the whole of the Austrian Netherlands.\n\nThe positions of the French and Austrian forces in this battle are represented in Plate DLIV. 1. The centre of the Austrian army, commanded by Clairfayt. 2. A part of this army commanded by General Lilien. 3. Another part under the command of General Beaulieu. 4. Redoubts on the heights of Jemappes. 5. Austrian intrenchments. 6. French columns advancing to attack the intrenchments. 7. A battery. 8. Columns of cavalry. 9. Columns attacking the eminences above Mons. 10. Battery on the height of Fremery. 11. The wood of Frefnee. 12. The plain on which the French and Austrian cavalry were engaged. 13. Austrian detachment.\n\nThe columns No. 9, were first engaged; and No. 6, having obtained some advantage, Dumourier ordered the battery, No. 7, to be erected, by which the redoubts, No. 4, were silenced. In the mean time the French advanced against the intrenchments, 5, and attacked in front. From the left of the French army, as far as the centre, the cavalry fought hand to hand, in the plain, 12, with the Austrian horse, which was dreadfully cut up in the wood of Du Frefnee, 11. The right of the Austrians, being totally routed, gave way and fell back on Mons. The superiority of the French in numbers is evident from inspecting the columns in the plan.\n\nAfter having dwelt so long on that part of military tactics which relates to operations in the field, we must be extremely brief with respect to the attack and defence of fortified towns. Indeed our principal object in this part will be to explain the nature of a siege, and of sieges, the various circumstances that may occur, both on the part of the besiegers, and on that of the besieged, rather than to lay down a system of instructions for either party. With this view, we shall first enumerate the principal instruments and engines employed in the attack or defence of a fortress, and explain the nature and construction of the works constructed by the besiegers, either for the purpose of making their approaches to the place, or for undermining its walls or outworks.\n\nIn Plate DLV. are represented the principal instruments employed in sieges. Fig. 1. is a fascine for the construction of redoubts or temporary defence of a detachment. Figs. 2, 3, and 4, exhibit various views of what are called gabions, or cylindrical cases of wicker work, open at both ends, for sticking into the ground, as seen at fig. 4, when they are filled with earth, and fascines, &c. laid on them. Fig. 2. is a section of the gabion; fig. 3. shows its hollow inside, and fig. 4. is its elevation. Fig. 5. and 6. represent bags for holding sand, the former empty, the latter full; and fig. 7. represents the manner in which they are usually disposed for the protection of the men. Fig. 8. is a fascine, or very long close faggot, for laying over gabions. Fig. 9. is the outline of a blind, which is stuck into the earth by the sharp stakes at its extremity, and hides the workmen from the besieged. Fig. 10. represents what is called a chandelier, and fig. 11. two of these with fascines piled up across them. Fig. 12. is a cheval de frise; fig. 13. 14. 15. exhibit various views of a mantlet, or moveable blind placed on two wheels, used both to protect and conceal the workmen of the besiegers. Fig. 13. is a plan of the mantlet; fig. 14. a side view of it; and fig. 15. a view of its front next the enemy. Fig. 16. is a madrier or screen with two leaves, moveable on wheels; and fig. 17. represents a gate with organs or lattice work on one side, and a portcullis on the other. Fig. 18. is a hook, and fig. 19. a fork used in fapping. Fig. 20. represents three caltrops or crow feet, used to scatter over the ground, to prevent the approach of cavalry, by laming their horses' feet. For a fuller explanation of these instruments, see the several articles in the general alphabet.\n\nWhen a town is about to be besieged, it is first invested; that is, a considerable body of troops, usually cavalry, encamp in its neighbourhood, and take possession of all the avenues till the army arrive, which is to carry on the regular operations of the siege.\n\nWhen the army has sat down before the place, its first object is, to ascertain the lines or direction of the circumvallation works to be thrown up for the attack of the place. These are called lines of circumvallation, and their direction is to be determined by the plan of the fortification about to be besieged. After ascertaining, in the manner explained under Fortification, the number of sides of which the polygon of the place consists, and the length of each, as well as the radius of a circle to be drawn round the place, concentric with its works, the polygon of the circumvallation is easily described. This being traced, the engineer takes on each of the extremities of its sides the lines BD and BE, fig. 21. Each of 15 fathoms, and from the points D and E, taken...\ntaken for the centre and distance of 25 fathoms, he describes two arcs cutting each other at F, whence are drawn the lines FD, FE, for the faces of the redans of the line of circumvallation; thus are formed the salient parts EFD of this line, which serve to flank it. The same operation is performed on every side of the circumvallation, and then the principal line is traced. The parapet within must be six or eight feet deep, and without is made a ditch parallel to all its parts, three or four fathoms in breadth. The parapet of the circumvallation will be \\(7\\frac{1}{2}\\) feet high, and the depth of the ditch equal to the height of the parapet.\n\nTo make the profile of the circumvallation, let AB, fig. 22, be a line level with the country, and CD the scale of the profile. Let A be the side of the town, and B that of the country; take AE of six feet; from the point E, raise the perpendicular EF, of three feet, and draw the line AF, which will be the talus or slope of the banquette.\n\nDraw FG parallel to AB, three feet from F to G, and the line FG will be the breadth of the banquette. On the point G raise the perpendicular GH, on the line FG, \\(4\\frac{1}{2}\\) feet. Draw from the point H, HK parallel to AB; make HK \\(7\\frac{1}{2}\\) feet, HI \\(1\\frac{1}{2}\\) foot; draw GI, which will be the inside of the parapet of circumvallation.\n\nFrom the point K, let fall on the line AB the perpendicular KM; take KL \\(1\\frac{1}{2}\\) foot, and draw IL, which will be the upper part of the parapet of the line of circumvallation. Take MN equal to five feet, and from the point N draw the perpendicular NO, and set off \\(7\\frac{1}{2}\\) feet from N to O. Draw OR parallel to AB, making the distance equal to 18 feet from O to R; draw LN, and produce it to P, and LP will be the face. From the point R raise RS, perpendicular to OR, or parallel to ON. Make QR = OP, and draw QS, which produce beyond S, three feet to V; then take SX equal to six feet, and draw VX, and the profile of the circumvallation is completed; VQ being the countercarp, and VX the glacis.\n\nAt A and A (fig. 21.) are small half moons before the gates of the circumvallation in the middle of the curtains.\n\nIn Plate DLVI, fig. 1, is represented the manner in which the lines of circumvallation were drawn at the siege of Philippsburg in 1734. In these lines regular bastions were constructed, as seen in fig. 2.\n\nFig. 4, 5, of the same plate represent another line of circumvallation drawn round the city of Arras, when it was besieged by the Spaniards in 1654. Before the circumvallation were dug a great number of holes, two feet in diameter, and \\(1\\frac{1}{2}\\) foot deep, in which were fastened stakes for obstructing the approach of cavalry.\n\nWhile the lines of circumvallation, which are intended to protect the besiegers from the enemy without, are constructed, all materials necessary for the trenches are got ready, and the figure and direction of these are determined. If the place be regularly fortified, and stand on level ground, it is indifferent on which side the besiegers commence their attack. Suppose C, fig. 2. Plate DLVII, to be the place besieged, and A and B two bastions to be attacked. The besiegers begin with indefinitely producing towards the field the capitals of these two bastions; in like manner the capital of the half moon opposite the curtain between these two bastions is produced. Eight hundred fathoms are set off from the salient angles D and E of the covert-way of F and G. This done, the lines DH and DI are drawn, each equal to 300 fathoms, and about the centre C with the radius CH or CI, is described an arch produced beyond H and I, and on this arch HI is constructed the first parallel. Then on the same lines DF, EG, are taken the points M and N, each 140 fathoms distant from H and I; and through these points M and N, about the centre C, is described another arch, on which is constructed the second parallel. This second arch will cut the produced capital of the half-moon in the point L, which is to be observed, in order to begin from hence a trench which may extend to the salient angle of the covert-way before this half-moon. Lastly, through the points O and P, the distance of 20 or 25 fathoms from the angles D and E, a third arch is described from the centre C, on which the third parallel is constructed. The first parallel is terminated by producing the faces ab, ab, of the half-moons 1 and 2, collateral to the bastions A and B; but the parallel is extended 15 or 20 fathoms beyond the intersection of this prolongation. The second parallel will be less extended than the first, by about 30 fathoms on each side, and the third less than the second by the same distance.\n\nThe trenches or approaches are now to be traced. For this purpose, the engineer takes a long ruler, and lays it on the point G, so that it may make with the produced capital EG of the bastion B, an angle EGS, whose side GS being produced, shall meet no part of the covert-way, and shall be distant about 10 or 12 fathoms from the angles to which it approaches nearest. GS is taken of any extent, and the ruler is put on the point S; so that it shall make with GS such an angle GST, as that the side ST produced shall not fall on any part of the covert-way, but be 10 or 12 fathoms distant from the most salient parts. This side is terminated in T; and now the angle STI is made, whose side TI should terminate at the point I, where it meets the first parallel. The same operation being performed on FH, the outline of the trenches is completed as far as the first parallel.\n\nFig. 1, of this plate illustrates the method of constructing what are called lines of counter-vallation. These are drawn nearer the town than the lines of circumvallation, but are constructed on the same principles. They are employed chiefly when the garrison of the place is so strong as to disturb the operations of the besieging army by sallies.\n\nIn sieges where the garrison is strong, it is often necessary to cut parts of trenches, as VV (fig. 2), between the second and third parallels, so as to communicate with the main trench. These parts of parallels are denominated half parallels, or places of arms, and are constructed in the following manner. Let ABCDEFGMQ (fig. 1. Plate DLVIII) be a part of the trenches, and let AB be one of the sides opposite to the enemy; produce AB, so that BE shall be five or six fathoms, and in FG take also five or six fathoms from I to L, which will give the ends of the trench BFLI, the use of which is to cover the boyace or branch IOMG, whereby the enemy will not know the place where it falls into the trench AB, and to make room for withdrawing those who are in this part of the trenches.\nes, and that the passage may be free at all the angles.\n\nIn like manner produce the side GM from M to N, and the side IC from O to P; and this will give the end of the trench MNOP, which will cover the branch DCOQ. The same is to be done at all the angles of the trench. The parapet of the trench being made to cover it, ought to change sides alternately. If, for instance, AE, in the preceding figure, be towards the place, it is evident that the side GN will be towards it also, and likewise the side CD; and therefore the parapet of the trench is successively constructed from the right side to the left, and from the left to the right.\n\nFigs. 2, 3, 4, of this plate represent profiles of the regular trenches and the places of arms, and require no particular explanation.\n\nIn tracing the trenches, it is of the greatest consequence to ascertain the distance of the extremity of the line of direction to the top of the salient angle of the covert-way. The following simple method of doing this is given by Vauban. Let A (fig. 5) be the vertex of the salient angle of the covert-way, and AB the line of direction of the trench whose length is required. At the point B, draw BC perpendicular to AB, to which give any measure, and at the point C draw CD perpendicular to BC. In CD take any point E, and in the line of direction between it and the angle A place a picquet G in the line BC. Measure GC and CE, and say, as GC : BG :: CE : AB.\n\nWhen in carrying on the trenches towards the town, the workmen begin to be much annoyed by the fire of the besieged, recourse is had to what is called sapping, which may be thus explained. Let ABC be the part of the trenches advanced to A (fig. 6, Plate DLVIII.), so near the town as to render it impossible, without evident danger, to work any longer at the approaches, unless the men have some cover against the fire of the place; and let the branch AD be traced by the engineer, not with a cord, as at the opening of the trenches, but with some pickets, which he has taken care to place in the direction this branch ought to have, to serve as a guide to the workmen. A cut is made in the parapet BA of the trenches, and then the men desirous to work by sap, who are therefore called lappers, will move forward through the opening A successively, eight in number. Fig. 7, of Plate DLVIII., and fig. 1, of Plate DLIX., will illustrate the mode of operation. The first sapper rolls a mantlet before him, and places a gabion on the line AD, fig. 6. He then makes a small excavation about six inches from the gabion, of about one foot and a half in depth, and as much in breadth, emptying the earth which he digs up into the gabion. He then pushes forward his mantlet, fixes another gabion, and continues his trench as long as he is able. He is followed by a second, who widens the trench six inches in breadth away from the gabion, and six in depth. The rest follow this second, till the trench is made three feet wide, and as many deep, and as soon as the gabions are filled with earth, fascines or fauconnets are placed on their top, and the superfluous earth is thrown over them, and on the opposite side, by way of parapet.\n\nCannon are made use of at a siege for two different purposes; the first to drive away the enemy from their defences, and the second to dismount their guns. To produce these two effects, the batteries should not be above the mean reach of cannon-shot from the place; that is, above 300 fathoms. Therefore there is no possibility of constructing them till the first parallel be formed; and as the distance of this first parallel from the place is generally 300 fathoms, the batteries must be on this line, or beyond it, nearer the town. They must always be placed, when the ground will permit, on the produced faces of the works attacked. Let Z be the centre of the place attacked (fig. 3, Plate DLIX.), and the trenches as well as the parallels completed. To find a proper position for erecting batteries, produce the faces AD, AC, BE, BF, of the two battalions attacked, till their prolongation cuts the first parallel. Produce also the two faces OM and OL of the half-moon MOL of the front attacked, and the faces HG and IK of the two collateral half-moons 1 and 2, to the first parallel, and erect batteries on those produced faces, as is seen in P, Q, R, S, T, U, X, and Y. They are advanced beyond the first parallel 40 or 50 fathoms; and are parted from the trenches, that they may be used with greater ease and convenience, and less trouble to the workmen.\n\nWhen the works of the besiegers approach the glacis, they are continued in a zig-zag direction, by short angular trenches, but from the foot of the glacis they are continued in the following manner. Two sets of sappers, protected by their mantlets, make a sap on each side of the ridge of the glacis, with a deeper ditch than usual, and a parapet on each side. This is called a double sap, and has across its traverses or banks three fathoms thick (see Plate DLX., fig. 1), with small paf- fages on one side (see fig. 4,) to preserve the communication. These traverses are constructed so near to each other, as to be a sufficient cover, by their elevation and distance, against the fire of the place. In order to guard against the effect of grenades, on coming within their reach, or within 14 or 15 fathoms of the covert-way, care must be taken to cover this trench with blinds, or to cover the upper part of it. Fig. 1, and 2, of Plate DLX. shew this direct trench. The first exhibits the plan, and the second the profile, which passes over one of the traverses. This being done, and the third parallel finished in the manner supposed, they advance from this parallel on the glacis to each of the salient angles of the covert-way of the front attacked, and begin with making two or three short turnings, as marked on Plate DLX., fig. 6, along the ridge of the glacis, so as to occupy about one-third of it. There are to be made as deep as is necessary, to be a shelter against the fire of the covert-way; afterwards they may proceed directly along the ridge of the glacis by a deep ditch, to the salient angle of the covert-way. M. Vauban observes, that if we follow directly the ridge of the glacis, this trench is made without much danger; for the palisade which is placed at the salient angle of the covert-way, and the other two next it, do not present directly to the ridge, but only opposite to the faces, where at most there is only room for one or two skirmishers to see the head of the trenches, and who are easily silenced by the fire of the third parallel, which ought to be well served, and likewise by that of the ricochet. On coming to the middle, or two-thirds of the glacis, two new saps are made, b, ibid., which embrace both sides of the covert-way, to which they are almost parallel. Their length is 18 or 20 fathoms, and about five broad.\nThey are covered at the end with crochets and winding traverses, which prevent the fire of the covert-way from enfilading them easily.\n\nIn this way is gradually effected a lodgement on the covert-way, as is represented in fig. 5, where AAAA, is the trench, with BBBB its traverses.\n\nPlate DLXI. fig. 5, represents a profile of these works, with three banquetttes next the trench, by which the parapet is raised, so that the soldiers may fire over into the covert-way. This work is called by Vauban, the cavaliere of the trench.\n\nWhen the besieged are entirely driven out of the covert-way, the next thing to be done is the erection of batteries, in order to ruin the defences of the place, and to make a breach. As it is necessary for the besiegers to make themselves masters of the half-moon C, (Plate DLX. fig. 6.) before they can come to the body of the place, which is defended by part of the faces of the bastions A and B opposite to its ditch, they must begin with erecting batteries on the covert-way opposite to these parts. They are marked on the plan ee. Batteries must also be erected to make a breach on the half-moon. But, before they are erected, it will be proper to consider what part of the face of the half-moon is to be attacked, or what part of the half-moon is to be entered. It must not be at its flanked angle, because an opening towards the point would not afford a sufficient space to make a lodgement able to withstand the enemy, and the troops would be seen in their passage by the two faces of the bastions by which its flanked angle is defended. The most favourable passage is towards the third part of its face, reckoning from its flanked angle, because by battering at the same time the two faces near this part, the whole point of the half-moon may be destroyed, and a large opening made there easier than anywhere else. Thus the batteries for making a breach in the half-moon C will be placed in d and b, and will occupy almost one-third of each of the faces of the half-moon from its flanked angle. These batteries are each to consist of four or five pieces of cannon. When the faces of the bastions A and B are well enfiladed by ricochet batteries, there will be no further occasion for the batteries e, e, and when the half-moon is taken, the faces of the bastions A and B may be destroyed, by using the batteries d, d, placing them in the situation of e, e. Batteries must also be erected to destroy the flanks of the demibastions in the front of the attack; and it is evident that they can be placed nowhere but at i, i, on the covert-way. Besides these batteries, others are erected in the re-entering places of arms of the covert-way, as in k; and in f they serve to batter the tenaille when there is one, the curtain, and the faces of the bastions. Sometimes they are of mortars for throwing flares.\n\nWhile the workmen are employed in erecting batteries on the covert-way, preparations are made for passing the ditch of the half moon. This is often a difficult and dangerous undertaking, as this ditch is commonly very deep, is well defended, and either filled with water, or in general capable of being so filled. The defences into the ditch is commonly effected by subterraneous passages or galleries, made like those of miners, and erected in such a manner, that its opening into the ditch may be opposite to the breach where it is intended to make the assault. These galleries are sloping, and in general there are several for the same passage. The passage is made on each side of the faces of the half moon. See mm, fig. 6. Plate DLXI.\n\nAs the business of forming these galleries is liable to be obstructed by mines from the besieged, the workmen are protected by a guard of grenadiers. At fig. 1, Plate DLXI, is seen a plan of the defences under ground, and of its opening into the dry ditch; and fig. 2, gives a profile of the same passage; fig. 3, gives a perspective view of the opening of this defences, seen from the bottom of the glacis, and fig. 4, a similar view of the opening of the same defences, seen from the top of the breach.\n\nAt Plate DLXII, fig. 1, is seen the plan of the passage over a wet ditch in the open air; that is to say, the gallery of which is an open top. A is the opening of it; at B, towards its opening, are seen the blinds laid on its upper part, to support the fascines with which it is covered. On these blinds, at first, is laid a bed of fascines, ranged according to the length of the gallery; over this first bed a second is laid, wherein the fascines are ranged according to the breadth of the gallery, as is seen at B and C. D is the empalement of fascines, which covers the passage against the fire of the place by which it is flanked. E is part of the bridge of fascines; and F is an elevation also of fascines, intended to cover the head of the work, and to secure it from the immediate fire of the place. Fig. 2, represents the profile of this defences into the ditch. Fig. 3, gives its opening seen in perspective from the country; and fig. 4, its opening into the ditch, also in perspective, as it appears from the top of the breach.\n\nThe following references will explain fig. 5, of Plate DLXII. a, cavaliers of the trenches. b, batteries of stone mortars. c, batteries to breach the half moon before the hornwork. d, batteries against the defence of this half moon. e, passages over the ditch before this half moon. f, lodgements in it. g, batteries against the flanks of the hornwork. h, batteries to breach the half bastions of the hornwork. i, batteries against its curtain. j, lodgements in the half bastions, and in the hornwork. m, passages over the ditch before the retrenchments in the hornwork. n, lodgements in these retrenchments. o, batteries against the defences of the collateral half moons. p, batteries to breach those half moons. q, passages over the ditch before these works. r, lodgements in the same. s, batteries to breach the redoubts of the half moon. t, passages over the ditch before the redoubts. u, lodgements in the redoubts. v, bridge of fascines. w, batteries against the defences of the bastion A. x, batteries to breach this bastion. y, passages over its ditch. z, lodgements in the bastion A.

E, passages over the ditch before this retrenchment.\n\nThere are places which, without any fore-ditch, have lunettes opposite to the salient and re-entering angles of the glacis, which are also enveloped by a second covert-way: sometimes they are vaulted and bomb-proof, as at Luxembourg; and sometimes they have only a ditch, a parapet, and covert-way. Those which are vaulted and bomb-proof are not easily taken, because the ricochet firing and the bombs can do them no mischief. In that case they must either be turned, or be taken by mines. A work is said to be turned, when the besiege...\ngers get between that work and the place, and so cut off their communication. Sometimes the lunettes have communication under ground, and then there is scarcely any other way of driving out the enemy but by mines. This is tedious, but there is no other remedy. The lunettes of the ditch are always defended by branches of the covert-way, with which they have also a communication like those of the lunettes, A, A, Plate DLXIII, fig. 1. This plate, which represents part of Landau and its attacks in 1713, may serve to give an idea of the manner in which a work is turned. The advanced lunette B, as well as the work C, called a tenaille, is turned; that is, the trenches cut off the communication betwixt them and the place.\n\nWe shall conclude this subject of the attack of fortified places, with the following principles to be observed by the besieging army.\n\nThe approaches ought to be made, without being seen from the town, either directly, obliquely, or in flank.\n\nNo more works should be made than are necessary for approaching the place without being seen; that is, the besiegers ought to carry on their approaches the shortest way possible, confidently with being covered against the enemy's fire.\n\nAll the parts of the trenches should mutually support each other, and those which are furthest advanced ought not to be distant from those which are to defend them above 120 or 130 fathoms.\n\nThe parallels or places of arms the most distant from the town, ought to have a greater extent than those which are nearest, that the besiegers may be able to take the enemy in flank, should they resolve to attack the nearest parallels.\n\nThe trench should be opened or begun as near as possible to the place, without exposing the troops too much, in order to accelerate and diminish the operations of the siege.\n\nThere is no such thing as giving any exact rule in regard to the distance which ought to be observed on opening the trenches. On level ground, this distance may be 800 or 900 fathoms; but if there should be a hollow way in the vicinity of the place, the besiegers are to take advantage of it, and open the trenches nearer. In general, they are to regulate themselves according to the nature of the ground, more or less favourable to the opening of the trenches. We shall suppose in the present work, that the opening ought to be made within 800 fathoms of the covert way; the first parallel within 300 fathoms, the second within 150, and the third at the foot of the glacis.\n\nCare must be taken to join the attacks, that they may be able to support each other.\n\nNever to advance a work unless it be well supported; and for this reason, in the interval between the second and third places of arms, the besiegers should make, on both sides of the trenches, smaller places of arms, extending 40 or 50 fathoms in length, parallel to the others, and constructed in the same manner, which will serve to lodge the soldiers who are to protect the works designed to reach the third place of arms.\n\nThe batteries of cannon must be placed in the continuations of the faces of the pieces attacked, to silence their fire, and that the approaches being protected, may advance with greater safety and expedition.\n\nFor this reason the besiegers should always embrace the whole front attacked, to have as much space as is requisite to plant the batteries on the produced faces of the works attacked.\n\nThe attack must not be commenced with works that lie close to each other, or with re-entrant angles, which would expose the attack to the cross fire of the enemy.\n\nMany circumstances respecting the defence of fortified towns have already been anticipated, or may be collected from what has been said respecting the operations of the besieging army. It is evident that the success or duration of the defence will depend in a great measure on the nature and strength of the works which form the fortification. Much, however, will also depend on the number, resolution, and resources of the garrison, and on the movements of the friendly army by which the besiegers may be opposed. It is estimated by M. Vauban, that the operations for a regular siege of a well fortified town, will take up about 41 days, before the place can be carried by assault. Hence is deduced a computation of the quantity of provisions, ammunition, and stores which ought to be collected for maintaining the siege. The same celebrated engineer calculates that the garrison ought to consist of 600 times as many men as there are bastions in the fortification, allowing 600 men to each bastion. Besides the necessary defence of the works by the cannon on the ramparts, and the musketry of the soldiers, the garrison must make occasional forlorn hopes, if weak, to disturb the operations of the besiegers, and if very strong, to engage them in the field. As the siege advances, and the attacking army approaches the glacis, mines should be sprung, and subterraneous passages excavated, to destroy the enemy's works, or cut off a part of their men.\n\nTowards supplying the unavoidable deficiencies in reference to the above sketch of military tactics, we may refer our readers to Clairac's Field Engineer, translated by Muller; Le Coindre, Science des Postes Militaires, or the English translation; Jeney's work entitled Le Partisan, also translated into English; O'Rourke's Treatise on the Art of War; Essai General de Tactique; Tielke on the Art of War, and his Field Engineer; Dundas's Principles of Military Movements; Landmann's Elements of Tactics; Maizeroy's Systeme de Tactique; Archives Militaires; Feuquier's Memoires; Bland on Military Discipline; Military Instructions for Officers detached in the field; and the articles Battalion and Battle in Rees's Cyclopaedia.\n\nPART II. NAVAL TACTICS.\n\nBY naval tactics is understood the art of arranging fleets or squadrons in such an order or disposition as may be most convenient for attacking the enemy, defending themselves, or of retreating with the greatest advantage. Naval tactics are founded on those principles which time and experience have enabled us to deduce from\nfrom the improved state of modern naval warfare, which has occasioned, not only a difference in the mode of constructing and working ships, but even in the total disposition and regulation of fleets and squadrons.\n\nIn the present part we propose to lay down the general principles of naval tactics, and to describe as briefly as is consistent with perspicuity, the most improved systems which are now adopted in the French and British navy. As we have elsewhere (see Navigation and Seamanship) detailed the methods of working single ships, as they are unconnected with military operations, we shall presume that our readers are already acquainted with these ordinary movements.\n\nFleets are generally divided into three squadrons, the van, centre, and rear, each under the command of a flag officer. The admiral of the fleet, or chief in command, leads the centre division, while the van is usually commanded by a vice-admiral, and the rear by a rear-admiral. Each squadron is distinguished by the position of the colours in the ships of which it is composed. Thus, the ships of the centre squadron carry their pennants at the main-top-gallant mast-head; while those of the van division have their pennants at the fore-top-gallant mast-head, and those of the rear at the mizen-top-mast-head. Each squadron, as far as possible, consists of the same number of ships, and as nearly as may be of the same force. In large fleets, the squadrons are sometimes again divided in a similar manner; the van and rear of the squadron being led by rear-admirals, or senior captains, called commodores. In the usual mode of forming the lines, each commanding admiral arranges his ship in the centre of his own squadron, and thus the admiral of the fleet is in the centre of the line. When no enemy is in sight, the sloops, store-ships, fire-ships, and other small vessels, are dispersed to windward of the fleet, that they may be more easily supported, and more readily answer signals. The frigates lie to windward of the van and rear of the convoy, thus keeping a good look-out, and keeping the small vessels in their proper station. When sailing in three columns, the centre still keeps in the middle, while the van and rear form the starboard or larboard column, according to circumstances. These arrangements are called orders of sailing, and will be better understood from the following definitions.\n\nThe starboard line of bearing, is that line on which the arranged ships of a fleet bear from each other, in a close hauled line, whatever course they may be steering, so that when the ships haul their wind, or tack together, they may be on a line close hauled upon the starboard tack. The larboard line of bearing is that line on which the ships when hauling their wind, or tacking together, may be formed on a line close hauled on the larboard tack. The ships of a fleet are said to be on a line abreast, when their keels are parallel to each other, and their mainmasts lie in the same straight line. Ships are said to lie in a line on the bow or quarter, when they are arranged in a straight line, cutting their keels obliquely in the same angle, so that reckoning from any intermediate ship, the ships towards one extremity of the line will be on the bow of that ship, while those towards the other extremity will be on her quarter. When several ships in the same line steer the same course, while that course is different from the line of sailing, they are said to fail chequerwise.\n\nWhen the ships of a fleet arranged in any of the orders of sailing, and on the same line, perform successively the same manoeuvre, as each gets into the wake of the ship that leads the van of the line or squadron, tacking or veering, bearing away or coming to the wind in the same point of the wake of the leading ship, they are said to manoeuvre in succession.\n\nThere are usually reckoned five orders of sailing, ex-illustrative of the line of battle, the order of retreat, &c., of the five orders of sailing. In the first order (see Plate DLXIV, fig. 1 and 2.) the fleet is arranged on the starboard or larboard line of bearing, all the ships steering the same course. In DLXIV, these cases the fleet, by hauling the wind when in the starboard line, as in fig. 1, will be ready to form the line on the starboard tack; and when ranged on the larboard line of bearing, as in fig. 2, it will, by tacking, be ready to form the line on the larboard tack.\n\nN.B. The arrows annexed to the diagrams on the plates, mark the direction of the wind, as in ordinary charts.\n\nThis first order of sailing is now seldom employed, except in passing through a narrow strait. In the second order of sailing, the fleet steering any proper course, is ranged in a line perpendicular to the direction of the wind, as in fig. 3. This second order, besides being equally defective with the former, is subject to the additional disadvantage of rendering it extremely difficult for the ships to tack, without each ship falling on board that next a-stern.\n\nIn the third order of sailing, the whole fleet is close hauled, and ranged on the two lines of bearing, so as to form an angle of 12 points, having the admiral's ship (A fig. 4.) in the angular point, and the whole fleet Fig. 4. steering the same course. Thus, supposing, as in the plate, the wind at north, the starboard division of the fleet will bear W. N. W. of the admiral, and the larboard E. N. E. This order in small fleets or squadrons, is superior to either of the former; but when the fleet is numerous, the line will be too much extended.\n\nIn the fourth order, the fleet is divided into six or more columns, and is thus more concentrated. The commanders, ranged on the two lines of bearing, have their squadrons altern of them on two lines parallel to the direction of the wind; the first ships of each column being, with respect to the commander of the squadron, the one on his starboard, and the other on his larboard quarter. The distance between the columns should be such that the fleet may readily be reduced to the third order of sailing, and from that to the order of battle. This order is adapted for fleets or convoys crossing the ocean, and is represented in fig. 5. But as it requires Fig. 5. much time to reduce a fleet from this order to that of battle, it is defective when in presence of an enemy.\n\nIn the fifth order, the fleet, close hauled, is arranged in three columns parallel to each other; the van commonly forming the weather, and the rear the lee column. See fig. 6. Fig. 7. represents the same order, Fig. 6. and except that each column is here subdivided into two, with the ship bearing the commander of each squadron in the centre of each subdivision.\n\nIn forming the order or line of battle, the ships of Order of the fleet are drawn up in a line nearly close hauled, battle standing.\nstanding under easy sail, so that each ship may be at a certain distance from the ship immediately a-head, as a cable's length, or half that distance. The fireships and frigates a-head and astern, form a line parallel to the former, and to the windward of it, if the enemy be to the leeward; but to the leeward if the enemy be to windward. This order is denoted by fig. 8, where the fleet is failing on the starboard tack, with the wind at north.\n\nWhen a fleet is compelled to retreat before a superior force, it is usually arranged in an order, the reverse of the third order of failing; the divisions of the fleet being ranged in the two lines of bearing, so as to form an angle of 135\u00b0 or 12 points, the admirals ships being in the angular point, and the frigates, transports, &c. included within the wings to leeward. See fig. 9, where the fleet is failing right before the wind. Though any other direction may be taken, the two lines still form the same angle.\n\nThe order of convoy is that in which the ships are all in each others wake, steering in the same point of the compass, and forming a right line. If the fleet is numerous, it may be divided into three columns, which are to be ranged parallel to each other, that of the admirable occupying the centre, and all steering the same course.\n\nHaving thus described the ordinary positions of a fleet, we must explain the manoeuvres by which they are produced, and we shall begin with the orders of failing.\n\nTo form a fleet in the first order of failing, supposing the ships to be in no particular order, that ship which is to lead on the proposed line of bearing for the order of failing, runs to leeward of the greater part of the fleet, and then hauls her wind under an easy fail. Each of the other ships then proceeds to take the proper station, by chasing the ship, which is to be a-head of her, and when in the wake of the leading ship, adjusts her quantity of canvas so as to preserve the proper distance. The ships thus arranged astern of each other, are in the line of battle, and from this the first order of failing is formed, by each ship bearing away at the same time, and all steering the proposed course.\n\nIn forming the second order of failing, the leading ship runs to leeward of so many of the fleet as that each ship may readily fetch her wake, and then steers a course eight points from the wind, under an easy fail. The line is formed by each ship in the same manner as in the first order, except that before bearing away, the line is perpendicular to the direction of the wind, or each ship has the wind on her beam.\n\nAs, in the third order of failing, the admiral's ship is in the centre; to produce this position, the fleet being formed in a line on one of the lines of bearing, and the ships steering in each others wake, ten points from the wind, the leading or leewardmost ship first hauls her wind. The second ship does the same as soon as she gets into the wake of the former, and this is done by each ship till the admirals ships haul their wind, when they reach the wake of the leading ship. At the same time that the admirals ship hauls her wind, the stemmost half of the fleet does the same. The ships are now in the third order of failing, from which the fleet can be formed in line of battle on either tack.\n\nTo form the fourth order of failing (see No. 58.), the commanding admirals range themselves on the two lines of bearing, at a proper distance from each other, steering the proposed course, and the ships of the several columns take each their respective places, parallel to each other, and forming lines in the direction of the wind.\n\nTo form the fifth order, the three leading ships of fifth order, the divisions take their posts abreast and to leeward of each other, keeping their wind under an easy fail; then the ships of each Squadron make sail, and take their respective stations at the proper distance astern of their leaders, while the commanders of each division, and the corresponding ships of each, keep mutually abreast of each other.\n\nIn forming from the first order of failing, if the ships are running large on the tack that answers to the line of bearing on which they fail, and if the line is to be formed on the same tack, all the ships haul their wind at once, or as quickly as possible after the next to windward; but if they be on the other tack, with respect to the line of bearing, they all haul their wind and tack or veer together. If the line of battle is to be formed on the other line of bearing, the ship most to leeward veers or tacks, and hauls her wind, while the rest of the fleet veer or tack at the same time, and steer with the wind four points free, and each ship hauls her wind as soon as she gets within the wake of the leader. See fig. 10. Plate DLXIV. and fig. 1. Plate DLXV.\n\nSuppose the fleet running before the wind in the second order of failing; to form the line from this position, all the ships haul up together on the proper tack, presenting their heads eight points from the wind at the line on which they are arranged; the leading ship then hauls her wind, immediately making fail, or shortening fail, so as to close or open the order, and the same is done successively by all the rest (see fig. 2.).\n\nIn a fleet running large in the third order, the line of battle is formed by the wing which is in the line of bearing corresponding to the tack on which the line is to be formed, and the ship at the angle hauling their wind together, while the ships of the other wing haul up together eight points from the wind. Each ship moving in this direction, till she reach the wake of the other wing, when the hauls close up (see fig. 3.).\n\nIn forming the line of battle on the same tack from the fifth order of failing (as the fourth is not calculated for forming a line of battle), the centre brings to, so as only to keep steerage way; the weather column bears away two points, and when it gets a-head of the centre, hauls its wind, while the ships of the lee column tack together, and crowd fail to gain the wake of the centre, when they retack together, and complete the line (see fig. 4.) or, the weather column brings to, while the centre and lee tack together, and bear away two points free. When the ships of the centre column have gained the wake of the van, they retack together, and bring to; and when those of the lee have gained the rear line, they retack together, and all stand on; or lastly, the lee column brings to, the centre runs under easy fail two points free, to get a-head of the rear Squadron, while the rear bears away under a press of fail two points free, to get ahead of the centre division.\n\n2. Suppose the weather and centre columns to interchange. To form the line under these circumstances; the centre stands on, while the weather column bears away eight points,\npoints, and having reached the wake of the centre, which now forms the van, hauls up; the ships of the lee column tack together, and run under a press of sail, within two points free, so just to gain the rear of the line; when they re-tack together (see fig. 5.), or the lee column brings to, while the centre squadron bears away three points under easy sail; and having reached the wake of the van, hauls up, to form the centre division.\n\n3. Suppose the centre and lee columns to interchange. The lee column stands on close hauled under an easy sail, the weather column bears away two points under a press of sail, till it reach the head of the line, when it hauls up, and the centre bears away eight points, and when in the wake of the lee, now the centre, hauls its wind. (See fig. 6.)\n\n4. If the weather and lee columns interchange; the lee column stands on under a press of sail close hauled, while the centre, under easy sail, bears away two points, and when it reaches the wake of the now van squadron, hauls its wind, and the weather column bears away eight points, hauling up when in the wake of the centre. (See fig. 7.)\n\n5. Suppose the centre column to form the van, and the weather the rear division. Here the lee column brings to, while the centre bears away two points, forming the line ahead of the former, now the centre, and the weather column veers away seven points on the other tack, forming the rear squadron. (See fig. 1. Plate DLXVI.)\n\n6. To form the line so that the lee column may form the van, and the centre the rear. The lee column is to stand on under a press of sail, while the weather bears away three points under easy sail, and the centre bears away eight points, the ships of each column hauling their wind, when in the wake of the now van division. (See fig. 2.)\n\n7. If the line of battle is to be formed on the other tack, so that the weather shall form the van division, as in the first case, the ships of the weather column first tack successively, while those of the centre and lee stand on, the former under easy sail, and the latter shortening sail, the leading ships tacking when in the wake of the now van, taking great care that the ships of the centre and lee draw not too near to the sternmost ships of the van, or to each other. (See fig. 3.)\n\n8. To form the line on the other tack, when the centre and weather columns interchange. The weather column brings to, while the centre column stands on, till the leading ship be fully able to clear the weather column, when the ships of the centre tack successively as they reach the wake of the van. The lee column stands on, tacking successively, as the ships get into the wake of the van, under moderate sail. (See fig. 4.)\n\n9. In forming the line on the other tack, when the centre and lee interchange. The centre brings to, while the ships of the weather tack under shortened sail, and the lee under a press of sail stands on, the leading ship having gained the wake of the line, tacks, and is followed in succession by her division. The centre column fills and stands on, when the first ship of that column, and the last of the lee, bear from each other in a direction perpendicular to that of the wind. (See fig. 5.)\n\n10. To form on this same tack, so that the weather and lee may interchange. The weather and centre bring to, while the lee crowds sail, till it can pass a-head of the weather column, when the ships tack in succession. As soon as the leading ship of the centre, and the last of the lee bear from each other in a line perpendicular to the wind, the centre fills, and tacks in succession when in the wake of the now van, and the ships of the weather column do the same when their leading ship and the last of the centre are under similar circumstances. (See fig. 6.)\n\n11. Suppose the centre is to form the van, and the weather the rear, in forming the line on the other tack. The weather brings to, while the other columns make sail, till they can pass a-head of the former on the other tack, when they tack successively. The weather column, when the others have passed it, fills, and tacks to form the rear. (See fig. 7.)\n\n12. Suppose now the lee column is to form the van. The weather and centre bring to, while the lee crowds fail, and tacks when it can pass a-head of the weather column. When the last ship of the now van has passed to windward of the former weather column, the van shortens sail, to give time for the other columns to form, and the weather and centre fill at the same time, to gain the wake of the van, when they tack in succession. (See fig. 8.)\n\nWe must now show how a fleet may be disposed in the principal orders of sailing from the line of battle; failing here, as before, we have several varieties.\n\n1. To form the first order of sailing from the line of battle on the same tack. All the ships are to bear battle, away together as many points as the admiral may direct, keeping in the line of bearing for the proper tack. The sternmost first bears away, and the others follow in quick succession, to prevent running foul of each other.\n\n2. If they are to form on the other tack; the leading ship bears away four points to leeward, and the rest follow in succession. The sternmost ship having bore away, the whole haul up, and will be in bearing for the line on the other tack. (See fig. 9.)\n\n3. To form the second order of sailing from the line of battle, the whole fleet is to bear away together ten points, so that when the headmost ship, which first presses fail, shall come abreast of the second ship, the second ship adapts her sail to keep in this bearing, and so in succession, each taking care to keep the preceding ship in a line with herself, perpendicular to the direction of the wind. The whole fleet will now be before the wind. (See fig. 10.)\n\n4. To form the third order, the whole fleet is to bear away together ten points, the headmost half, including the centre ship, carrying a degree of sail to preserve their line of bearing, while each of the remaining ships is successively to shorten sail, so as to form the other line of bearing with respect to that on which they were before arranged. (See fig. 1. Plate DLXVII.)\n\n5. To change from the line of battle to the fifth order on the same tack. Of this evolution there are several varieties, but we shall mention only two; first, when the van is to form the weather, and the rear the lee column, and the fleet to keep as much as possible to windward.\u2014In this case the van and centre tack together, and run close hauled in bow and quarter line, while the rear proceeds in its former course under easy sail. When each ship of the centre is abreast of the corresponding ship of the rear, the centre retacks, while\nwhile the van stands on, till the centre and rear come up, when it also retacks, and all the columns regulate their distances. (See fig. 2.)\n\nSecondly, when the van is to form the lee, and the rear the weather column.\n\nThe van bears away under easy sail, and goes at right angles with the line ahead, while the centre runs two points free, each ship steering for that ship of the van which is to be abreast of her when in column. The distance must be determined by the leader of the van, who is not to haul up with her division, till she and the sternmost ship of the centre column are in a line at right angles with the wind, when both stand on under easy sail, while the rear crowds fail to pass to windward of both. (See fig. 3.)\n\n6. To form the fifth order of failing from the line of battle on the other tack\u2014of which there are also several varieties; but we shall confine ourselves to two: First, when the van is to form the weather, and the rear the lee column; the van tacks in succession, while the leading ship of the centre is to tack when the leader of the van passes him exactly to windward, in which she is followed by her division, and the rear manoeuvres in the same manner with respect to the centre. (See fig. 4.) Secondly, when the rear is to form the weather and the van the lee column; the van tacks in succession, and when about, either shortens fail, or brings to, to allow the other columns time to form. The centre and rear then crowd fail, and tack in succession, the former tacking when its leader has the centre of the lee column in a line at right angles with the wind, or when its centre passes a-fight of the centre column. When the centre has tacked, it regulates its rate of failing by the lee, and both wait for the rear to pass to windward. The rear tacks when the leader has the first ship of the lee in a line at right angles with the wind, or when its centre ship passes a-fight of the centre column. (See fig. 5.)\n\n7. Fig. 6 represents the order of retreat formed from the line of battle, the whole fleet going four points free. This evolution is so seldom required in a British fleet, that we need not dwell on it.\n\nThere are various evolutions or manoeuvres performed by a fleet when in line of battle, some of which we must here describe.\n\nSometimes the fleet has to form the line on the other tack, by tacking in succession. To do this, the leading ship of the fleet tacks first, after making more fail, or after the second has shortened fail, to increase the interval between them. When the first ship is about, either the second makes more fail, or the third shortens fail, and as soon as the second gets into the wake of the leader, the tacks, putting down the helm just as the opens the weather quarter of the first ship, already on the other tack. In the same manner, each of the other ships tacks when in the wake of the leader; and the ships already about must preserve their proper distances, by shortening fail, if necessary, till the whole fleet be on the other tack. If a ship should miss stays, the mult immediately fill again on the same tack, and make fail with all possible expedition, taking care not to fall to leeward. Thus she will get a-head, and to windward of the following ships, which will successively perform their evolutions in the wake of the ships that are already on the other tack, standing on rather further than if the ship a-head had not missed stays. (See fig. 7.)\n\nBut suppose the ships are not to tack in succession.\n\nTo form the line on the other tack, the whole fleet veers together; the rear ship hauls her wind on the other tack, and stands on, while the rest go two points free on the other tack, and haul up as they successively gain the wake of the leading ship. (See fig. 8.)\n\nIf the line is to veer in succession, the van ship veers, and stands four points free on the other tack, hauling her wind when clear of the sternmost ship, and the rest follow and haul up in succession. (See fig. 9.)\n\nSometimes the fleet has to turn to windward while in line of battle. The best way to do this, when there is good sea-room, is for all the ships to tack together, when the fleet will be in line of battle on the one board, and in bow and quarter line on the other. If, however, the fleet be turning to windward in a narrow channel, it is best for the ships to tack in succession, as were they all to tack together, the van would be soon in with the land on one side, while the stern ship, soon after the fleet had retacked, would be too near the land on the other side.\n\nIf the van and centre are to interchange; the van is to bear away a little, and then bring to, while the centre passes on to windward, edging a little, to get a-head of the former van on the same line; the rear, coming on under an easy sail, edges away likewise, to gain the wake of the now centre squadron. (See fig. 10.)\n\nIf the van and rear are to interchange; the van and centre are to bear away a little, and then bring to, so that the van may bear away a little more to the leeward than the centre. The rear stands on to gain the head of the line; and when a-breadth of the former van, the centre fills, and both standing on, form a-head of the new rear, by edging down till they are in a line with it. (See fig. 11.)\n\nIf the centre and rear are to interchange; the van stands on under an easy sail, while the centre bears away a little, and brings to, and the rear at the same time carries a press of sail to pass the centre to windward, and get into the wake of the van. The van and centre then edge away to gain the line, with the now rear squadron, which then fills. (See fig. 12.)\n\nSeveral evolutions are required while a fleet is in the fifth order of failing, and of these we shall notice some of the more important.\n\nWhen the columns are to tack in succession, the ships of the lee must tack first, as they have most distance to run, and when the leader of the centre comes abreast of the leader to leeward, or at right angles with the close-hauled line on the other tack on which the leader of the lee is now moving, the tacks and is followed successively by the ships of her division. The weather column manoeuvres in the same manner, paying the same regard to the centre. Here the weather column is still to windward, and should the columns have closed too much, or be too far astern, the order may be recovered, either by the lee or windward column bearing away, so as to make an angle equal to that proposed between any column, and a line joining the leader of that column, and the sternmost ship of the next. (See fig. 13.)\n\nWhen all the columns are to tack together; the sternmost ships put in stays together; and when in stays, their seconds a-head put down their helms, and so on through the whole fleet. Each column will then be in bow and quarter line. (See fig. 14.)\nWhen the columns are to veer in succession; the leader of the lee column must steer four points free on the other tack, followed by the ships of that division, and when she is clear of the sternmost ships of that division, she hauls up. The same evolution is performed by the centre and weather ships successively, standing on till they bring the point at which the lee column began to veer to bear in a right line to leeward of them. They likewise successively spring their luffs when the point at which the lee column hauled its wind, bears right to leeward. (See fig. 15.)\n\nSuppose the fleet, when in the fifth order of sailing is to turn to windward; let the ships be so arranged that the leaders and corresponding ships may be in the direction of the wind. The van ships must tack together, which are followed in succession, each by the remaining ships of the division, when they reach the wake of their leaders, or the same point when they tacked; so that there will always be three ships in stays at once, till the whole fleet is on the other tack. The fleet then stands on to any proposed distance, and retacks as before. (See fig. 1, Plate DLXVIII.)\n\nWhen the weather and centre columns interchange; the weather and lee lie to, or only keep steerage way. The centre column tacks together, and forming a bow and quarter line, goes close hauled to gain the wake of the weather column; it then tacks together, and stands on, while the weather column bears away to its new station in the centre, and the lee column fills. (See fig. 2.)\n\nWhen the weather and lee columns are to interchange; the centre column must bring to; while the lee stands on under press of sail; and when its sternmost ship can pass to windward of the van of the centre column, that is, when the centre ship of the lee is in a perpendicular line to the direction of the wind with the van of the centre column, the lee column then tacks together, and stands on close hauled till it comes in a line with the centre column, when it goes large two points to get into the situation which the weather column left; and then veers together, hauling the wind for the other tack. At the beginning of the evolution the weather column bears away together under little sail, and goes large six points on the other tack, to get into the wake of the centre column; it then hauls to the former tack, going two points large, till it comes abreast of the centre column, when it brings to, and waits for the now weather column. (See fig. 3.)\n\nSuppose the weather column is to pass to leeward; the weather column is to stand on under easy sail, while the centre and lee tack together, carrying a press of sail till they reach the wake of the weather column, when they retack, and crowd sail till they come up with it. The weather column, when the others have gained its wake, bears away two points, to gain its station to leeward, when it brings to, till the other columns, now the weather and centre, come up. (See fig. 4.)\n\nSuppose the lee column is to pass to windward. The weather and centre columns bring to, while the lee column carries sail and tacks in succession, as soon as the leading ship can weather the headmost ship of the weather column; and when arrived on the line on which the weather column is formed, it retacks in succession, forms on the same line, and either brings to or stands on under easy sail. If it brings to, the other two columns bear away together two points, to put themselves abreast of the column now to windward; but if the now weather column stood on under an easy sail, they may bear away only one point, to gain their proper stations. (See fig. 5.)\n\nIt is of the greatest importance that each ship of a fleet or squadron preserve her proper station, and distance with respect to the rest. These may be regulated in two ways, either by observation with the quadrant, or by what is called the naval square. This square is usually constructed in the following manner.\n\nOn some convenient place in the middle of the quarter-deck is described the square ABCD, fig. 6, having the fides AD and BC parallel to the keel of the ship, and the lines GH, GI, and thus the naval square is completed. Now the angles FGD, FGC are = 4 points each, being each half a right angle, therefore the angles EGD, EGC, the complements of these angles, are each = 12 points, and consequently the angles EGH, EGI are each = 6 points, being each half of the last angles. Now, if a ship be running close hauled on the starboard tack, in the direction FE, the direction of the wind will be IG, and her close hauled course on the other tack will be GC; but if she be running close hauled on the larboard tack in the same direction, her direction when close hauled on the starboard tack will be GD.\n\nNow, to apply the naval square to the keeping of ships in their respective stations, suppose the fleet formed on the fifth order of sailing, close hauled, the corresponding ships of the columns coinciding with the direction of the wind, in order to run to windward with greater facility. The corresponding ships in the column must be kept in the direction of GH, or GI, according to the direction of the wind and the tack they are on, while all the ships of the same column must be in the direction of EF. (See fig. 7.)\n\nAgain, suppose the ships arranged in three columns on one of the lines of bearing, and close hauled on the other tack. The ships of each column will be in the direction of one of the diagonals, while the corresponding ships of the other columns will be in the direction of the other diagonal. (See fig. 8.)\n\nSometimes the line of battle is disordered on the To restore wind's shifting, and requires to be restored. Of this there are several cases, a few of which we shall notice.\n\n1. When the wind comes forward less than 6 points, wind. In this case the whole fleet except the leader brings to. The leading ship, that the same distances between the ships may be preserved on restoring the line, steers a course as ab (fig. 9.), so as to be at right angles with the middle point between the former and present direction of the wind. His required course may be known by adding half the number of points the wind has shifted to eight points, and applying this sum to the former close-hauled course. When the leader has arrived at the new close-hauled line with respect to the second ship ahead, this ship immediately fills, and bears away as many points as the leader; and when both these have reached the close-hauled line with respect to the third ship, the also fills, and bears away; and thus with the rest in succession; and when they have got into the close-hauled\nclose-hauled line \\( bc \\) with the sternmost ship, they all haul their wind together, and the sternmost ship fills and stands on close hauled.\n\nThis may be expediently performed, if the whole fleet fall off as soon as the wind shifts, the same number of points, and the leader bear away eight points from the middle between the former and present directions of the wind, or when the wind shifts nearly six points, if the leader bear away eight points from the present direction of the wind, and hauls her wind as soon as the sternmost ship bears from her in the close-hauled line, while the second ship bears away when she reaches the wake of the leader, and hauls her wind when she has again gained his wake. The third, fourth, &c., ships bear away, and also haul their wind in succession, till the sternmost and the whole line be formed again. (See fig. 10.)\n\n2. Suppose the wind comes forward less than six points, and the order of battle is to be re-formed on the other tack. In this case all the ships are to veer round till their heads come to the requisite point with respect to their former course, when the rear ship, now become the van, hauls close by the wind, followed successively by the other ships. Should the wind come ahead more than six points, but less than twelve, the fleet is to manoeuvre as before, but if it shift exactly twelve points a-head, the tack must be changed.\n\n3. Lastly, suppose the wind to shift oft\u2014if less than two points, the leader hauls her wind, while the fleet stands on as before, each successively hauling her wind as she gains the wake of her leader. If the tack is to be changed, the whole fleet tack together, and the sternmost ship, now the leader, hauls up, while the rest bear down and haul up in succession.\n\nShould the wind change 16 points, all the ships immediately brace about for the other tack, by which means the fleet will be going four points large; then the ships instantly tacking or veering together, the order of battle will be restored or formed again on the same tack as before the wind changed.\n\nIt is incumbent with the nature of our plan to be more minute on the various evolutions of a fleet, when not in action with the enemy. Our nautical readers will find abundant information of this kind in the usual works on naval tactics, especially the Elements and Practice of Rigging, Seamanhip, Naval Tactics, &c., of which the latest edition is in 4 vols 8vo.; and The System of Naval Tactics, with coloured figures, both published by Steel.\n\nHaving described and illustrated the principal evolutions which are performed by fleets or squadrons under ordinary circumstances, we are prepared to consider the nature and consequences of a naval engagement.\n\nIn forming a fleet for battle, it is proper to consider the size and number of the ships of which it is to consist, and the distance at which they are to be placed with respect to each other. In the present system of naval warfare, it is generally deemed of advantage to have the ships that are to form the principal line as large as possible; for though large ships are not so easily and expeditiously worked as those of a smaller size, they are most serviceable during the action, both carrying a greater weight of metal, and as being less exposed to material injury, either from the enemy's shot, or from the weather. In boarding too, a large ship must have greatly the superiority over a smaller, both from her greater height, and from the number of hands which she contains. With respect to the number of ships, it is of advantage that they be not too numerous, as if the line be too extensive, the signals from the centre are with difficulty observed.\n\nIn arranging a fleet in line of battle, it is proper to regulate the distance so that the ships shall be sufficiently near to support each other, but not so close as that a disabled ship may not readily be got out of the line without disturbing the rest of the fleet.\n\nIt has long been deemed a point of great consequence with the commander of a fleet to gain the weather gage, and advantages or to get to windward of the enemy, before coming to the weather action. In deciding on the propriety of this, much will depend on the relative strength of each fleet, and on the state of the weather at the time. We shall state the advantages and disadvantages of the weather gage, as they are commonly laid down by writers on naval tactics, though we may observe by the way, that if a fleet be much superior to its opponent, it is seldom of consequence whether it engages to windward or to leeward.\n\nA fleet to windward of the enemy is thought to possess the following advantages. It may approach the leeward fleet at pleasure, and can of course accelerate or delay the beginning of the engagement. If more numerous, it may send down a detachment on the rear of the enemy, and thus throw him into confusion. It may also readily send down fireships on the enemy's fleet, when thrown into confusion or disabled. It may board at any time, and is scarcely incommodeed by the smoke of the enemy. The reverse of these circumstances, of course, act against a leeward fleet.\n\nThe disadvantages of being to windward of the enemy respect chiefly the circumstances attending a retreat, should this be necessary. The windward fleet can seldom retire without passing through the enemy's line; and if in attempting to retreat, the windward ships tack together, those of the leeward fleet may do the same, rake the weather ships in flays, and follow them on the other tack, having now the advantage of the wind. In stormy weather, the windward ships can seldom open their lower deck ports, and the lee guns are not easily managed after firing. Again, any disabled ships cannot easily quit the line without disordering the rest of the fleet, and exposing either that or themselves to be raked by the enemy to leeward. A leeward fleet has the advantages of serving their lower-deck guns in all weathers; of being able to retreat at pleasure; of drawing off without difficulty their disabled ships; of forming with more readiness the order of retreat, or of continuing the action as long as convenient; of having it in their power when superior in number, to double the enemy, and of cannonading with great effect the windward ships as they bear down for the attack.\n\nAs an engagement between two adverse ships is in some measure an epitome of an engagement between two fleets, we shall first briefly describe the former, as it takes place under ordinary circumstances, and shall then notice the usual manner of conducting a general engagement.\n\nA naval engagement may be divided into three stages, the preparation, the action, and the repair.\nWhen an enemy's ship heaves in sight, and it is thought advisable to bring her to an engagement, orders are first given to clear for action, which is begun by the boatwain and his mates piping up the hammocks, in order to clear the space between decks, for the more easy management of the guns, as well as to afford the men on the quarter-deck, &c., a better protection against the enemy's shot, the hammocks being stowed in the nettings above the gunwale and bulwarks. After this, the boatwain's mates go to work to secure the yards, which is done by fastening them with strong chains or ropes in addition to those by which they are suspended. They likewise get ready such materials as may be necessary for repairing the rigging, if it should be cut away, or otherwise damaged by the enemy's shot. In the meantime the carpenter and his mates prepare hot plugs and mauls, to stop any dangerous shot holes that may be made in the hull near the surface of the water, and provide the necessary iron work for refitting the chain-pumps, if their machinery should be injured during the engagement; while the gunner and his mates, and the quarter gunners, examine the guns, to see that their charges are dry, and provide every thing that may be required for supplying the great guns and small arms with ammunition. The master and master's mates see that the sails are properly trimmed, according to the situation of the ship, and increase or reduce them as may be found necessary; and the lieutenants visit the different decks, to see that all is clear, and to take care that the inferior officers do their duty.\n\nWhen the hostile ships have approached within a proper distance of each other, the drums beat to arms; the boatwain and his mates pipe all hands to quarters! All the men who are to manage the great guns repair immediately to their respective stations. The crows, handspikes, rammers, sponges, powder-horns, matches, and train tackles, are placed in order by the side of the guns: the hatches are immediately closed, to prevent seamen from getting below; the marines are drawn up on the quarter-deck, &c., the lashings of the guns are cast loose, and the tomions withdrawn. The whole artillery, above and below, is run out at the ports, and levelled to the point blank range, ready for firing.\n\nWhen these necessary preparations are completed, and the officers and crew ready at their respective stations, and when the two ships are sufficiently near each other, in a proper relative situation for the shot to take full effect, the action commences with a vigorous cannonade from the great guns, accompanied by the whole efforts of the swivels and small arms. The firing is seldom performed in volleys, as that would shake the ship too much, but the guns are loaded and fired one after another, with as much dispatch and as little confusion as possible, care being taken to fire only when each gun is properly directed to its object. During the firing, the lieutenants traverse the decks, to see that the battle is prosecuted with vivacity, and that the men do their duty, while the midshipmen second their injunctions, and give the necessary assistance where required, at the guns committed to their charge. The youngest of these inferior officers are generally employed to carry orders from the captain. The gunners are all this time employed in the magazines, filling cartridges, which are carried along the decks in boxes by the boys of the ship. When the action has continued so long, or has produced such an effect, that one of the ships must yield or retreat, if the vanquished ship cannot get off, she acknowledges her inferiority by striking, or hauling down her colours, when she is, as soon as possible, taken possession of by the victor, the commander of which sends a part of his own crew into the captured ship, and brings away most of her officers and men on board his own ship, as prisoners of war.\n\nThe engagement being concluded, they begin to repair pair; the guns are secured by their breechings and tackles, with all convenient expedition. Whatever sails have been rendered unserviceable are unbent, and the wounded masts and yards struck upon deck, to be filled or replaced by others. The standing rigging is knotted, and the running rigging spliced where necessary. Proper sails are bent in the room of those which have been displaced as useless. The carpenter and his mates are employed in repairing the breaches made in the ship's hull, by hot plugs, pieces of plank, and sheet lead. The gunner and his assistants are busied in replenishing the allotted number of charged cartridges, to supply the place of those which have been expended, and in refitting whatever furniture of the guns may have been damaged by the action.\n\nA general engagement between two adverse fleets of vessels involves a greater variety of circumstances, and requires greater judgement, and more comprehensive skill in the commanding officer.\n\nWhen the commander of a fleet has discovered an enemy's fleet, his principal object, if he be sufficiently strong, is to bring it to action as soon as possible. Every inferior consideration gives way to this important object, and all necessary preparations are immediately made to prepare for such an event. The state of the wind and situation of the enemy will in general regulate his conduct with regard to the disposition of his ships on that occasion. To facilitate the execution of the admiral's orders, the whole fleet is disposed in three squadrons, and each of these clasped into three divisions, under the command of different officers. Before the action begins, the adverse fleets are drawn up in two lines, as formerly described. As soon as the admiral displays the signal for the line of battle, the several divisions separate from the columns in which they were disposed in the usual order in sailing, and every ship crowds sail to get into its station in the wake of the next ahead; and a proper distance from each other is regularly observed from the van to the rear. The admiral, however, occasionally contracts or extends his line, so as to regulate the length of his line by that of his adversary. This is more particularly necessary to prevent his being doubled, by which his van and rear would be thrown into disorder. When the hostile fleets approach each other, the courses are commonly hauled upon the brails, and the top-gallant sails, and staysails furled. The movement of each ship is regulated chiefly by the main and fore-top sails and the jib: the mizen-top sail being referred to haften or retard the course of the ship; and by filling or backing, hoisting or lowering it, to determine her velocity. The signal for a general engagement is usually displayed when the fleets are sufficiently near each other, to be within the range of point-blank shot, so that the guns may be levelled with some certainty of execution. After the battle has commenced, it is carried on much in the same manner as between two ships, except that each vessel...\nvessel of the fleet, besides attending to her own movements, has to observe the signals made by the commanding officer, and repeated by the frigates on the van and rear. The chief object of the admiral is to keep his line as complete as possible, by ordering ships from those in reserve to supply the place of such as may have been disabled, and to annoy the enemy as much as possible, both by strengthening the feeble parts of his own line, and, if circumstances admit of it, by sending down fire-ships upon that of the enemy. When the engagement draws near a close, either by the defeat of the enemy, or by the disabled state of either fleet, signals are made from the admiral, to take possession of each of the enemy's ships as have struck, to tow his own disabled ships into a place of security, and either to chafe the remainder of the enemy's squadron, or, if that be impracticable, to draw off his own ships to be refitted.\n\nSuch are the general incidents attending an engagement at sea, modified of course by numerous circumstances, of which a general description can convey no idea. There are, however, various movements and evolutions connected with a naval engagement, which it will be necessary for us to notice.\n\nWhere the weather gage is deemed of sufficient importance, it is often an object with two fleets to dispute it with each other. When the enemy is to windward, and it is wished to gain the weather-gage of him, the fleet to leeward should avoid extending itself the length of the enemy's line, in order to oblige them to edge down upon theirs, if they intend to attack them; which will be a mean, if they still persist in doing so, of losing the advantage of the wind. It is impossible for a fleet to leeward to gain to windward, so long as the enemy keep the wind, unless a change happens in their favour; therefore all that a fleet to leeward can do must be to wait with patience for such a change, of which they will undoubtedly avail themselves, as well as of any inadvertency the enemy may commit in the mean time. And as long as the fleet to leeward does not extend its line the length of the enemy's, it will be impossible for the latter to bring them to action without running the hazard, by bearing down, of losing the advantage of the wind, which both fleets will be so desirous of preserving. That an admiral may take advantage of such shifts of wind as occasionally happen, he must endeavour to get his ships into such situations where these shifts most frequently take place. It is well known to experienced naval officers, that particular winds reign most on certain coasts, or off certain headlands. Here, therefore, the admiral should await the approach of the enemy; and though by this plan he may sometimes be unsuccessful, he will more frequently gain a material advantage. The disposition of projecting headlands, and the setting of tides or currents, often contribute materially towards gaining the wind of the enemy. The fleet to windward should keep that to leeward as much as possible abreast of it; and thus, unless the wind changes considerably, they will preserve the advantage they have gained. They should also force them to keep their wind, unless they think it prudent not to engage, in which case it would be better to keep altogether out of sight.\n\nWhen the enemy appears desirous of avoiding an action, there are various methods of attempting to force him to engage; as first, when he has the weather gage. In this case the lee fleet, which is desirous of bringing on an engagement, must keep always on the same tack with the enemy to windward, taking care to keep their own ships to exactly abreast of the enemy, as to prevent losing sight of them; and hence be ready to take advantage of the first favourable shift of wind to make the attack. An alteration of the course may be best attempted in the night. The lee fleet must have frigates on the look-out, and these must continually give notice by signal of the manoeuvres and course of the retreating fleet to windward. Thus the weather fleet is always exposed to pursuit, without being able to get off unseen; hence must sooner or later be compelled to an engagement, unless they can get into some friendly port, or should be favoured by a gale of wind insufficient to disperse both fleets, and thus prevent the possibility of a general engagement.\n\nSecondly, when the enemy is to leeward.\u2014If the lee fleet keep close to the wind in the order of battle, the fleet to windward is to stand on in the same manner till it be abreast of the enemy, ship to ship, and at the same time to bear away, and steer so as to bring their respective opponents on the same point of the compass with themselves. Thus the adverse fleets will be sufficiently near each other to begin the action, by each ship's presenting her bow to the ship abreast of her in the order of sailing, which may be easily changed for the order of battle, by all the ships hauling together close to the wind, in the moment which precedes the action. If the fleet to leeward appear inclined to engage, it may bring to, to prevent losing time, and after this they will fill as soon as the action commences, because it is of advantage to a lee line to be advancing ahead. As the lee fleet fills and stands in close by the wind, the weather line should keep abreast, before it bears away, to come within the requisite distance, that the van ship of the weather fleet may always keep to windward of the leading ship of the lee line, and be guarded against any shift of wind ahead.\n\nIf the lee fleet bear away four points to move their order of battle on the other tack, and avoid the action, filing off in succession in the wake of the van ship, the weather line, by bearing away all together eight points, cannot fail, as both fleets are supposed to sail equally, to pass through the middle of their line, and force them to fight with disadvantage, if their extent be double the distance between the two fleets. If the extent of the fleet be less than the above limitation, then the weather fleet will divide the lee fleet more unequally; and if the distance between the fleets be considerable, the weather fleet will be able to break through the line. If the lee fleet bear away four points all together, being of equal extent with the fleet to windward, and their distance from each other equal to that of the length of one of the lines; should the weather fleet bear away at the same time eight points, they will approach very near the sternmost of the retreating fleet; but they will not have it in their power to cut off any part of that fleet, even with an equality of sailing; so that the only advantage gained by this manoeuvre will be an ability of attacking the rear, and bringing it to action.\n\nIf the van ship and the rest of the weather fleet had a sufficient velocity to keep the centre ship of the lee line on the same point of bearing; in that case, the leading ship may break through the enemy's line about the middle\nmiddle ship of the centre division; for, supposing the fleets in the order of battle, on the starboard tack, steering east, with the wind at south-south-east, being at two leagues distance from each other, both the lines being four leagues in extent; then the lee line bearing away all together four points, will run north-east; while the fleet to windward, bearing away all together eight points, will steer north; the van ship of which will keep the centre division of the lee line in the point of bearing north-west. As she is supposed to be able to continue in this position, it follows, that the van of the weather line must close the centre of the flying line to leeward, after having run four leagues. The time and distance necessary to cut off a retreating fleet may always be known according to the last supposition. If the lee fleet should get on the other tack, and run large, still in the order of battle, they will be sooner forced to action by the weather fleet, who have only to bear away eight or nine points on the same tack, or run right before the wind.\n\nAs in forcing a fleet to action, there are two principal cases in which a fleet may avoid an action, where circumstances are not sufficiently favourable; first, when the enemy is to windward, and secondly, when he is to leeward. In the former case the lee fleet should form the order of retreat, if the enemy are in view, and run on the same tack as their leading ship; but if he is still out of sight, and they have received intelligence of his approach, by their frigates on the look-out, they may bear away large, without confining themselves to keep the wind directly off, unless when in the order of retreat. In the second case, it seldom happens that the weather fleet can be forced to an engagement, because it can always stand on that tack which increases its distance from the enemy; that is, by standing on one tack while the enemy is on the other. The windward fleet must of course not keep too near the enemy, and take all possible means of avoiding being abreast of him.\n\nIt is often of advantage to double the enemy; that is, to bring a part of the fleet round upon his van or rear, so as to place him between two fires. This manoeuvre also resolves itself into two principal cases: first, when the enemy is to windward; secondly, when he is to leeward. In the first case, the lee fleet that attempts to double the enemy, should extend itself abreast of him, so that its van or rear may extend beyond his line, in order to overreach him, by tacking in succession, so that the extended part of the line may get up to windward. If this manoeuvre be properly executed, it will be impossible for the ships of the weather line long to maintain their stations, for no vessel closely attacked by two others of equal force can long resist.\n\nIt is of some consequence to determine whether the attempt to double should be made on the van or the rear of the enemy, as on the propriety of adopting the one or the other of these measures, may in a great measure depend the issue of the battle. In the present case, it is most easy to double the van of the enemy, because if they are engaged by the ships abreast of them, those which are advanced ahead will be able, by making all fail, to get in the perpendicular to the direction of the wind with the van of the enemy, and tack in succession to gain the wind of them on the other board, thus keeping them to leeward; and when they are come sufficiently to windward, they are again to go about, in order to keep the two headmost ships of the enemy's line continually under their fire. If there be two or three ships to tack in succession and gain the wind of the enemy, they may edge down on the van of the water line at pleasure, keeping themselves a little to windward of it; and as that van is already engaged by the other ships abreast on the other side, she must necessarily be soon disabled. If they bear away, they must drop upon the line with which they are engaged to leeward, while the ships to windward still continue to cannonade them. If they attempt going about, in order to attack more closely the ships to windward, they will be raked, while in stays, by their opponents to leeward and to windward, who enfolding them with whole broadsides, which they cannot return, must complete their disorder. If they make sail, in order to frustrate the design of the ships inclined to double, those with which they are engaged abreast to leeward have only to perform the same manoeuvre, and keep them under their fire; while the others, after having harassed them as much as possible, will do their best to perform the same manoeuvre on the succeeding ships.\n\nIf any of the ships in the van of the weather line are disabled in their masts or yards, they will drop astern, and run foul of the next succeeding ship, and there again on the next astern. Thus, the enemy's order of battle will be broken, while on the other hand the lee line is preserved; and those ships which have gained the wind of the enemy will, without engaging more ships than they can manage, contribute to increase the confusion.\n\nWhen the enemy is to leeward, and the weather fleet attempts to double, the ships of the weather line must extend their van beyond that of the enemy, and then veer in order to bring the headmost ships of the lee line between two fires. It must not, however, be concealed, that it is much more dangerous to the ships engaged in this service to attempt doubling a fleet to leeward, than one to windward, as if disabled, or separated too far from their own fleet, they cannot so easily extricate themselves, and rejoin the fleet.\n\nWhen one fleet attempts to double another, this latter will of course do all in their power to avoid the impending danger; and this they will the more readily do, according to their number, or their situation. If the fleet thus threatened be to windward, one of the methods proposed to avoid being doubled, is to extend the line towards the point threatened, so as to leave a greater space between the ships; but in doing this, there is a risk of having the line broken by the superior enemy. Another method suggested is, for the flag ships of the windward fleet to oppose themselves to those of the lee line, which is supposed to render several of the enemy's ships in the intervals of little use; but one great inconvenience of this manoeuvre is, that it leaves the van and rear most exposed to the enemy's fire, and that the rear division in particular is in great danger of being doubled. To remedy these defects, the largest ships should be placed in the van and rear of each division, and the fleet must regulate its failing in such a manner that its rear shall never be astern of the rear of the enemy.\n\nWhen the enemy is to leeward, the weather fleet is to keep astern of the enemy, so that the van of the weather fleet, may be opposed to, and attack the enemy's centre. Hence the enemy's van will become useless for some\nPart II.\n\nW A R.\n\nNaval Tactics.\n\nSome time; and should it attempt to tack and double on the weather fleet, much time will be lost in performing that evolution; and it also runs the risk of being separated by the calm which often happens in the course of an engagement, occasioned by the discharge of the guns. A considerable interval might also be left between the centre and van, if necessary precautions be taken to prevent the van from being cut off.\n\nThere are several circumstances of importance to be considered in the subject of chafing, i.e., when one ship or fleet pursues another, called the chase, either to bring her or them to action, or to oblige them to surrender.\n\nWhen a single ship chases another, it is to be presumed in general, that one of them is the better sailer, though this is not always the case, and still by proper manoeuvring the chasing ship, or chaser, may gain on the chase. In the following observations, however, we shall suppose the chaser to fail faster than the chase. The manoeuvres of the chaser will depend on her being to windward or leeward of the chase.\n\nWhen the chase is to windward, it is evident that as soon as she perceives a strange ship which she takes for an enemy, she will haul her wind, in order to prolong the chase, as otherwise her retreat would soon be cut off. The chaser then stands on also nearly close hauled, till she has the chase on her beam; she then tacks, and stands on close hauled till the chase is again on her beam, and then retacks. In this manner she continues tacking every time she brings the chase perpendicular to her course on either board; and by thus manoeuvring, it is certain that the chaser will, by the superiority only of her sailing, join the other in the shortest time. For since the chaser tacks always as soon as the chase is perpendicular to her course, she is then at the shortest distance possible on that board; and since the chaser is supposed to be the faster sailer, these shortest distances will decrease every time the chaser tacks. It is therefore of advantage to the chase to keep constantly on the same course, without losing her time in going about, as tacking cannot be so favourable to her as to her adversary, whose sailing is superior. If the captain of the chaser should do little understand his profession as to stand on a long way, and tack in the wake of the chase, the best thing she can do is to heave in stays, and pass to windward of him on the other tack, except she should find herself likely gaining advantage by going large; for if the chaser persists in tacking in the wake of the other ship, the pursuit will be very much prolonged.\n\nWhen the chase is to leeward, the chaser is to steer that course by which she thinks she will gain most on the chase. If, after having run a short time, the chase is found to draw more aft, the chaser should then bear away a little more; but if the chase draw ahead, the chaser should haul up a little, and thus the course may be so regulated that the chase may always bear on the same point, and then the chaser will get up with the chase in the shortest time possible; for if any other course were steered, the chaser would be either too far ahead or too far astern, and hence the pursuit would be prolonged. The chase should run on that course which will carry her directly from the chaser, and should consider which is her best trim with respect to the wind, that she may move with the greatest possible rapidity from the chaser; for some ships have more advantage in going large, others with the wind right aft, and others when close hauled.\n\nAnother method has been proposed for chasing a ship to leeward, that is, by constantly steering directly for Curve of the chase; in this case, the track described by the chaser purist is called the line or curve of pursuit. To illustrate this, let A (fig. 11. Plate DLXVIII.) represent the chaser, and B the chase directly to leeward of her, and running with less velocity than the pursuer, in the direction RC, perpendicular to that of the wind. Now, to construct this curve, let B b be the distance run by the chase in any short interval of time; join A b and make A 1 equal the distance run by the chaser in the same time. Again, make b c, c d, d e, e f, &c., each equal to B b; join 1 c, and make 1, 2 = A 1; join 2 d, and make 2, 3 equal to A 1; proceed in like manner till the two distances carried forward meet as at C, and a curve described through the points A, 1, 2, 3, &c., will represent nearly the curve of pursuit; and the less the interval A 1 is taken, the more accurately will the curve be formed. In this particular case, the length of the distance BC may be found as follows, provided the distance AB and the proportional velocities of the two ships be known.\n\nLet the velocity of the chase be denoted by a fraction, that of the chaser being unity. Multiply the given distance AB by this fraction, and divide the product by the complement of the square of the same fraction, and the quotient will be the distance run by the chase B. Suppose AB, the distance of the chase directly to leeward of the chaser, be taken at 12 miles, and suppose the velocity of the chase three-fourths of that of the chaser; what will be the distance run by the chase before she is overtaken? Now \\( \\frac{12 \\times \\frac{3}{4}}{1 - \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2} = \\frac{9}{\\frac{7}{16}} = 20 \\) miles; and since the velocity of the chaser to that of the chase is as 4 to 3, hence the distance run by the chaser will be \\( 20 \\times \\frac{2}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 27 \\frac{3}{7} \\) miles. As the chaser alters her course at every point, and probably sails better with the wind in one direction with respect to her course than when the wind is in another direction, her velocity will be different at different points of the course. Thus, suppose her to sail faster when the wind is on the quarter, her velocity will constantly increase to a certain point, and will then diminish. Hence in real practice the curve of pursuit will not be exactly what is laid down in the above problem, and of course the measure of BC will differ a little from what we have there laid down. See RESISTANCE of Fluids and Seamanship.\n\nIf the whole fleet is to give chase, the admiral will make the proper signal, and then each ship will instantly make all the sail possible. If the retreating fleet is not much inferior to the other, a few of the fastest failing vessels only are to be detached from the superior fleet, in order to pick up any stragglers, or those ships which may have fallen astern; and the remaining part of the fleet will keep in the same line or order of sailing as the retreating fleet, so that they may, if possible, force them to action. But if the retreating fleet is much inferior, the admiral of the superior fleet will make the signal...\nsignal for a general chase, and then each ship will immediately crowd all the sail possible after the retreating fleet; or, if the chase be still less numerous, the admiral will detach one of the squadrons of his fleet, by hoisting the proper signal for that purpose, and he will follow with the remainder of the fleet. The squadron that chases, should be very careful not to engage too far in the chase, for fear of being overpowered; but at the same time to endeavour to satisfy themselves with regard to the object of their chase. They must pay great attention to the admiral's signals at all times; and, in order to prevent separation, they should collect themselves before night, especially if there be any appearance of foggy weather coming on, and endeavour to join the fleet again. The ships are diligently to observe when the admiral makes the signal to give over chase; that each regarding the admiral's ship as a fixed point, is to work back into her station, to form the order or line again as quickly as the nature of the chase and the distance will permit.\n\nWhen a fleet is obliged to run from an enemy who is in flight, it is usual to draw up the ships in that form or order, called the order of retreat; and the admiral, when hard pursued, without any probability of escaping, ought, if practicable, to run his ships ashore, rather than suffer them to be taken afloat, and thereby give additional strength to the enemy. In short, nothing should be neglected that may contribute to the preservation of his fleet, or prevent any part of it from falling into the hands of the conqueror.\n\nWe have now gone through the principal evolutions of fleets and squadrons, nearly as they are described in the Elements of rigging, seamanship, and naval tactics, and other approved publications on similar subjects. We have indeed omitted the method of forcing an enemy's line, and of avoiding being forced, because the former will be readily understood from what we have to add on the improved method of tactics of M. Grenier, and Mr Clerk of Eldin.\n\nVarious defects have been observed in the tactics usually employed at sea, especially in a line of battle, and in the mode of bringing an enemy to action. The usual order of battle first introduced by the duke of York, afterwards James II. of England, is defective from its length. Its great extent makes it difficult for the admiral to judge what orders are proper to be issued, to the ships stationed at the extremities, while his signals, however distinctly made, are liable to be mistaken by the commanders of these ships. Besides, the extremities of a long line, especially if it be to leeward, are necessarily defenceless, as the enemy may throw himself with a superior force on the van or rear, and cut either of these off before it can be properly supported by the other squadrons. Viscount de Grenier, who was, we believe, one of the first to notice these defects, proposed to remedy them by introducing a new order of battle.\n\nThe leading principles of De Grenier's tactics are founded on the following considerations. It is evident that each ship of a fleet must at all times occupy the centre of a certain horizon. This horizon De Grenier divides into two unequal parts, calling the greater the direct and graduated space, and the less the indirect, crooked, and ungraduated space. The reason of these appellations is, that on the greater segment of the horizontal circle there are 20 different points, which may be marked by degrees from one of the clove-hauled lines to the other, and to which a ship may fail from the centre by so many direct courses without tacking; whereas from the other 12 points, including that from which the wind blows, she cannot arrive but by steering crooked courses, which must necessarily delay her progress. Suppose now a fleet to leeward, lo disposed that only a part of it can fight with another equally numerous, and ranged to windward in a single line, and let the lee fleet be ranged on three sides of a lozenge \\(a b, c d, e f\\), (fig. 12.). The squadron \\(a b\\), which is most to windward, being drawn up in line of battle, cannot be fought but by an equal number \\(A B, C D, E F\\). All the rest of that fleet therefore must remain inactive, unless the ships which are not engaged should try to pass to leeward of the fleet \\(a b, c d, e f\\). But should the ships of the weather fleet, which are placed between \\(B\\) and \\(F\\), bear away as they appear in the figure between \\(C i\\) and \\(F i\\), the ships between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), which are fighting to windward, cannot bear away with them. Suppose now that the ships between \\(C i\\) and \\(F i\\) have passed to leeward, the squadrons \\(c d, e f\\), which are ranged according to De Grenier's system, and have not yet been engaged, should come to windward and join with their friends \\(a b\\) against that squadron of the enemy \\(A B\\) which is still to windward and engaged; it is almost impossible but that the squadron \\(A B\\) must be destroyed by so great a superiority, before it could receive assistance from the ships to leeward between \\(C i\\) and \\(F i\\).\n\nDe Grenier proposes only three orders of failing, one when a fleet is to pass a strait; a second when it flees or failing in open sea, on the look out for an enemy, or with a view to avoid him; and a third when on an extensive cruise disposed so that it cannot be easily surprised or broken. Of these three orders only the second and third differ from the usual orders of failing. The former of these is represented by fig. 1. Plate DLXIX., where the columns \\(a b, c d, e f\\), are disposed on three sides of a regular lozenge, on the two clove-hauled lines. The ships of the two divisions \\(c d, e f\\), sometimes to windward (as in fig. 2.) and sometimes to leeward (as in fig. 1.) of the third division \\(a b\\), are to be formed on two parallels of one of the clove-hauled lines in the wakes of their respective headmost ships; while the third division \\(a b\\) is to be ranged ahead or astern of the others on the other clove-hauled line, steering chequerwise the same course as the other divisions.\n\nWhen \\(a b\\) is to windward of \\(c d\\) and \\(e f\\) (fig. 1.), De Grenier calls that the windward primitive order of failing, and when to leeward (fig. 2.), the fleet is said to be in the leeward primitive order of failing. These are the two principal positions in almost every case, and with very little variety, may become the order of battle, of chafing, &c.\n\nHis third order is illustrated by fig. 3., where the divisions \\(a b\\) and \\(e f\\), are supposed at the distance of about six leagues from each other; \\(c d\\) and \\(e f\\) reeling on the extremities of the base of a triangle \\(S T V\\), while the centre ship of the division \\(a b\\) rests on its summit \\(T\\); none of the divisions could be cut off by an enemy, however formidable, seen from its centre ship at the distance of six leagues. For if, on the proper signal, the division \\(a b\\) should steer from \\(T\\) toward \\(X\\), on the course opposite\nopposite to the close-hauled line it steered before, and the two divisions \\( e \\) and \\( f \\) steer from \\( V \\) and \\( S \\) towards \\( X \\) likewise, it is plain that each of these divisions would have only three leagues to run to join the other two, while the enemy which was first perceived at the distance of five leagues, must run nine before he can come up with the nearest of these squadrons.\n\nTo form De Grenier's order of battle represented in fig. 4, and 5, it will be sufficient for the ships of the three divisions ranged in the windward primitive order of failing (see No. 90.) to heave in stays all together, and get on the other tack on the opposite line of bearing (fig. 4.) or for the ships in the leeward primitive order at once to haul the wind on the same tack as they steer; and they will find themselves in order of battle, fig. 5.\n\nWhen the two columns \\( c \\) and \\( d \\), are to leeward of the third division \\( a \\), ranged in order of battle, this is called the natural order of battle, and when \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) are to windward of \\( a \\), this is the inverted order of battle. The former of these is calculated for a fleet combating to leeward, and the latter for a fleet which must fight to windward.\n\nTo explain the advantages of these dispositions, let us suppose the line \\( A \\), \\( B \\), \\( C \\), \\( D \\), \\( E \\), \\( F \\), fig. 6, to represent an enemy's fleet to windward in the usual order of battle, on the close-hauled line, and on the starboard tack, and let \\( a \\) be one of the divisions of a fleet disposed according to the new natural order, on the starboard tack, while the line \\( c \\) and \\( d \\), represent the other two divisions standing on chequerwise on the same tack, but formed on the opposite close hauled line. When the enemy comes to attack this latter fleet on a supposition that it is inferior to their own, their divisions \\( A \\) and \\( E \\), in order to attack the ships \\( a \\) or \\( b \\), must bear away. Now, to prevent the attack, each of the divisions \\( c \\) and \\( d \\), must make the following evolutions according to their respective situations, and the manoeuvres of the enemy.\n\n1. The ships of the division \\( a \\) are to slacken as much as possible their headway, and form a very close line, till the enemy makes a movement to attack the headmost or sternmost ship of that division.\n\n2. The ships of the division \\( c \\) are to make fail till they come under the second or third ship of the rear of the line of battle \\( a \\), when they will take the same sail as the ships of that division, to preserve that position until the hostile ships make their evolution to attack the rear ships of that division. In this situation the ships of the division \\( c \\) will be able to observe the manoeuvres of the enemy, in order to change tack, and form themselves in order of battle on the opposite board as soon as the hostile ships shall have run over a certain space; because the ships of the division \\( c \\), steering afterwards close hauled in the wake of the sternmost ship of the division \\( a \\), will be able to cover the rear ships of that division, and get the weather-gage of the hostile divisions which are bearing away; rake their ships; run along side of them; double their rear-guard, and put it between two fires, if those hostile ships are following in the wake of each other divide it, if they bear away chequerwise, or gain to windward, and put between two fires the enemy's division \\( CD \\), while engaged with the division \\( a \\). 3. The division \\( e \\) may abandon their port, and run chequerwise under a press of sail as soon as the enemy falls ahead of \\( a \\); that if the enemy's division \\( AB \\) attempts to fall on \\( e \\), or on the van of \\( a \\), they may, by going about,\n\nsteer in order of battle close hauled on the opposite line, and cover the ship \\( a \\), double the hostile division \\( CD \\) ahead, or divide \\( AB \\) which is running chequerwise on the opposite tack.\n\nFig. 7, marks another method of manoeuvring by the division \\( d \\), \\( e \\), \\( f \\), when the enemy's ships are arranged in a single line not well formed.\n\nFigs. 8, and 9, illustrate De Grenier's method of replacing the admiral's ship, and the frigates and transports attached to a fleet. A, fig. 8, is the admiral ranging the headmost of the fleet, at a short distance from the admiral's ship, tripping the wind as the headmost ship of the first division; gates and \\( f \\) are two frigates obliterating the same rule and position transports. Figs. 8, and 9, illustrate De Grenier's method of replacing the admiral's ship, and the frigates and transports attached to a fleet. A, fig. 8, is the admiral ranging the headmost of the fleet, at a short distance from the admiral's ship, tripping the wind as the headmost ship of the first division; gates and \\( f \\) are two frigates obliterating the same rule and position transports.\n\nWhen the fleet is in order of battle, as in fig. 9, the admiral's ship \\( A \\) is in the centre of the lozenge, and two of the frigates, \\( f \\), on the fourth side of lozenge. The transports and store-ships, when the fleet is in order of failing or convoy, occupy the space circumscribed by the lozenge, but in order of battle they are disposed in a line opposite to that of the enemy.\n\nWe cannot enter on a more minute or satisfactory account of this system; for a full exposition of which we must refer to the original work entitled L'Art de Guerre sur Mer, ou Tactique Navale, &c., par M. le Vicomte de Grenier, or the extracts from it contained in the Elements and Practice of Rigging and Seamanship.\n\nWe must now turn our attention to the improvements Mr Clerk's tactics suggested by our countryman Mr Clerk, improvements which have received the approbation of several distinguished officers of the British navy, and to hints derived from which we are in a great measure indebted for some of the most signal victories which have heaped additional honour on the naval power of Britain.\n\nBefore entering on an explanation of Mr Clerk's tactics, we must briefly state his objections to the usual method of bringing ships to action, by the weather ship method of fleet steering directly down upon the enemy. By doing this, the enemy to leeward often has an opportunity of completely disabling the ships making the attack, as the former can use all their guns on one side, while the latter can only use their bow chafes. Suppose \\( B \\), fig. 10, Plate DLIX, to represent a ship of 80 guns to windward, in sight of an enemy's ship of equal force \\( F \\), to leeward. Now, if \\( B \\) bears down directly upon \\( F \\), the latter, by lying to, as in fig. 11, and 11, will present a broadside of 40 guns, all bearing for a considerable time on \\( B \\), while the latter coming down headwise, can only bring the two light guns of her forecastle to bear on \\( F \\), not to mention that \\( F \\), by lying broadside to, will have her masts and rigging little exposed to the enemy's shot, while \\( B \\) standing head on, is exposed to be raked by every shot from \\( F \\), and in particular her rigging is in the utmost danger.\n\nInstead of this objectionable mode of attack, Mr Clerk proposes that \\( B \\) having the wind, should run down after as in the dotted line at fig. 12, till she gets into the course of \\( F \\), near her wake, or in such a position as will bring her parallel to \\( F \\)'s course, and within a proper distance, when she can run up close along side of \\( F \\), and engage on equal terms; or, that she should shoot ahead, then veer, and run down on the weather bow of \\( F \\), as in fig. 13, till she can force the chafe to bear.\nbear away to leeward, keeping close by her, on equal terms, taking care in both cases not to put it in the power of F to bring her broadside to bear on her without retaliation.\n\nFig. 14. is employed by Mr Clerk to illustrate the different procedure of a French and British man of war in firing, the former at the rigging, and the latter at the hull of the enemy, with their effects. Let F represent a large ship desirous of avoiding a close engagement, but lying to, to receive with advantage an enemy's ship B, of equal force. Suppose that F, by firing at the rigging of B, may have carried away some of the principal stays, several of the windward throats, a fore-topmast, or other rigging of less consequence, without having wounded a single man; and suppose a second ship consort to F, receiving an enemy's ship like B, but firing only at her hull, so as to kill 30 or 40 men, without damaging her rigging. Now, when F and her consort wish to avoid a close engagement, it is evident that that ship B, which has lost part of her rigging, is much more disabled from coming to close action than her consort whose rigging is entire, though she may have lost a great number of her men.\n\nBy the scheme at fig. 15, it is intended to illustrate the impossibility of one ship being exposed to the fire of many ships at one time. Let I, H, F, H, I, represent five ships in line of battle ahead, about a cable's length, or 240 yards astern, and suppose the length of each ship to be 40 yards, so that the whole space between the head of one ship and the head of that next adjacent equals 280 yards. Let the perpendicular line FK, extending from the beam of F six cables lengths or 1440 yards, be divided into six equal parts. It is evident that any ship stationed at E in the line FK, 720 yards distant, cannot long be exposed to the fire of more than the centre ship F of this squadron. For if we suppose that H and K ahead and astern of F, can bring their broadsides to bear on E; by putting themselves in positions for that purpose, they will not only disorder their own line, but one will leave her head and the other her stern exposed to a raking fire from the opposite ships BB in the enemy's line. If B can suffer little from the two ships H, H, at the distance of 720 yards, it is evident that she will suffer still less from these ships as she approaches nearer the enemy's line. Again, if instead of a cable's length astern, we suppose the ships I, F, I, two cables length astern, to bear on the ship B. It is evident from the figure that in this case B will not be more exposed to the fire of I and I at the distance of 1440 yards than she was to that of H and H at half that distance; and so in similar cases.\n\nIn explaining the principles on which we are to judge of the advantages or defects of different modes of bringing ships to action, Mr Clerk supposes a fleet of 10, 20 or more ships of 80 guns each, drawn up in line of battle to leeward, as at F, fig. 16. And lying to with an intention to avoid an action; while another fleet, as B, of equal number and force, also drawn up in line of battle, three or four miles to windward, wishes to make an attack, and come to close quarters on equal terms. The fleets being thus disposed, should the fleet at B attempt running down to attack the fleet at F, each ship standing head on to the opposite ship in the leeward line, it is to be expected, from what we have already stated, that the attacking ships will be disabled, at least in their rigging, before they can come to close action; but suppose that the commander of the weather fleet, though his ships have been disabled in their rigging during their course a.a.a to leeward, fig. 17, has made them bring to at a great distance, but sufficiently near to injure F. This latter fleet, which has been endeavouring to avoid an action, will now bear away with little injury to a new station, as G, and there remain out of the reach of B's shot, and this fleet must repair its rigging before it can make another attack.\n\nAgain, suppose that the fleet B, instead of standing head on, were to run down in an angular course, as at fig. 18. It is plain that if any ship in this angular line should be crippled, her defect in failing will occasion a confusion of several of the other ships in that line. It may be said that the stoppage of one ship a-head will not necessarily produce a stoppage of every ship a-stern of her, because they may run to leeward of the disabled ship; but we must observe that by this time the ships a-head in the van A may be engaged, and consequently not having much head way, are nearly stationary, so that each ship a-stern, in attempting to bear down as at D, D, must be confined to a certain course, and must run the risk of being raked in coming down before the wind, and consequently of being disabled before coming up with the enemy.\n\nThirdly, the van of the fleet B having attained their station at A, a-breadth of the van of F, fig. 19, and having begun the action, the van ships of F, with a view to retreat, may throw in a broadside on the van of B, and then bear away in succession, as at H, followed by the rest of the fleet F, which, after exchanging broadsides with the van of B, may draw up in a new line two or three miles to leeward at I, fig. 20.\n\nSuppose again, for further illustration, that B, fig. 1, Plate DLXX., represents a fleet putting before the wind, each ship intending, when brought to at a determined distance at A, to take up her particular antagonists in the line of the enemy F to leeward; and let F be supposed at rest, without any motion a-head. It is easy to conceive that while the alternate ships of F's line, under cover of the smoke, withdraw from battle to GGG, the intermediate ships left behind them in the line will be sufficient to amuse even the whole of B's fleet, till the ships G shall form a new line HH as a support from the leeward. In such case B, after being disabled, and not having foreseen the manoeuvre, will neither be able to prevent the intermediate ships with which he is engaged from bearing away to join their friends, nor, were he able, would it be advisable to follow them, for the same manoeuvre with equal success can again and again be repeated.\n\nTo explain the relative motion of these two fleets, let Fig. 2, F, fig. 2, represent a fleet of 12 ships in line of battle, a cable's length astern, and suppose the length of each ship from the end of the jib-boom to the stern to be 36 fathoms. The whole fleet will occupy a space of two English miles; and if it be supposed to fail in the direction FG, at the rate of four knots an hour, it will in an hour have moved to G, four miles from its former position.\n\nNow, let there be an opposite fleet B, also 12 ships, situated four miles to windward, and let the point A be a quarter of a mile right to windward of the point G. Then, if B by bearing away in the direction BA, gain\nthe point A at the same time that the leeward fleet F has arrived at G, B will have moved nearly at the rate of 5\u00bd miles an hour, and the angle contained between the direction of its line of bearing and its present course will be nearly four points.\n\nSecondly, in fig. 3, if F, by carrying more sail, move at the rate of six miles an hour, from F to G, then B, with a more flanking course, will have more difficulty in keeping the line abreast while coming down to the attack, owing to the additional obstruction which will attend each succeeding ship in such a flanking course. Again, if the leeward fleet shall lie up one point higher, as FG, fig. 4, the rears of the two fleets will be removed to a much greater distance, and the van A must be sooner up with the enemy's van, and of course too much farther from support, while F bringing up his ships in succession, may disable the van of A, and afterwards bear away at pleasure with little injury, as at H. Now B being supposed disabled, and having his rear D disengaged, will be unable to prevent F from escaping.\n\nFrom these considerations it appears that a fleet to windward, by extending its line of battle with a view to stop and attack the whole line of an enemy's fleet to leeward, must labour under considerable disadvantages, and will scarcely succeed in the attempt.\n\nOn these principles Mr Clerk explains the reason why, before the commencement of the present contest between Britain and France, the French fleets so repeatedly escaped from the British, without any serious defeat or loss, viz. by avoiding a general engagement, and disabling the British van as it bore down to attack them. He therefore recommends a different mode of attack from the windward, which we shall proceed to illustrate by proper diagrams.\n\nLet F (fig. 5) represent a fleet in line of battle, under easy sail, willing to avoid an action, but ready to receive an attack in the usual way, from another fleet B, three or four miles to windward, arranged in three columns. How shall B make the attack on F, so as, without aiming at the improbable advantage of taking or destroying the greater part of this fleet, they may secure three or four of the sternmost ships? Mr Clerk advises, that a sufficient strength be detached to secure these ships, while the admiral keeps aloof with the rest of his fleet, disposed as in the figure, ready to make the necessary observations and give the requisite support to the detached ships. If F continues to avoid an action by standing on in line, the detachment, coming into the position BA, will secure the three ships at I; and if the headmost ships of F were to tack, and be followed by the rest in succession as at fig. 6, not only the three ships at I will be left at the mercy of the ships detached from B, but two more, as G, will be exposed to an attack from another squadron of B at C. If all the ships of F tack together, as in fig. 7, the delay, and probably the confusion, consequent on this manoeuvre, will still more endanger the sternmost ships, or will bring on a general and close action. Again, if F attempts to haul off, beginning with his sternmost ship G, and then runs to leeward, as at fig. 8, he will expose his ships to a raking fire from B, and still endanger his sternmost ships by getting too far to leeward for their support; or if the headmost ships at H, fig. 9, veer first, to be followed by the rest aft, the danger would be still greater. Thus it appears that in every assignable case, a fleet to leeward, avoiding an attack from an equal or superior windward, as here advised, by preserving the line, will risk the loss of three or more of their sternmost ships.\n\nNow, let us suppose that F, while standing on in fig. 10, 11, line on the larboard tack, when threatened with an attack on his rear from B, veers and passes on opposite tacks to leeward (see fig. 10). The consequence of this will be, that his headmost ships will be forced to leeward by B, and compelled to engage under disadvantageous circumstances, and the disadvantage to F will be much the same, whether he again veers and resumes his former position, as at G, fig. 11, or stands on before the wind, as at P, fig. 12.\n\nWe have hitherto supposed that the wind has been fixed in one point; but let us suppose it to shift, and let us inquire what will be the effect of such a circumstance on the two lines F and B. While the fleets are in the former position, F in line, and B in four divisions B, B, B, A, steering E, with the wind at N, fig. 13, let the wind shift to the west. The only consequence of this will be, that F will be thrown still farther to leeward, to its greater disadvantage. But let the wind shift to E, so as to be a-head, as in figs. 14, Figs. 14, and 15. Still if the admiral of B manages properly, and carefully watches the motions of F, this change will produce no advantage to the latter. For B has nothing to do but veer as the wind comes round, so as to bring his ships to windward of the three sternmost ships of F, and to leeward of the rest of his line, so as to cut off the three sternmost ships.\n\nIf the wind should be supposed to veer from point to point all round the compass, so that the fleet F, maintaining the weather-gage of B, shall make a circuit round B to leeward; till if B act cautiously, F will lose the three threatened ships.\n\nLastly, suppose the wind should instantly shift to a Fig. 16, point opposite to what it was at the commencement of the attack, as from N. to S. Before it can be ascertained whether such a change will be to the advantage or disadvantage of F, the relative situations of the two fleets must be considered. Suppose that the van and centre be separated at some distance from his rear, and that in consequence this fleet shall have taken such a position as is shown at fig. 16. Though in this case he Fig. 16, will have got to windward, his three ships can never be regained or preserved from the attack of B. The most favourable situation for F would be when the fleets were in the position denoted by fig. 13, as then he could not only support his three ships with advantage, but even threaten, and cut off a part of B's detachment. In attempting this, however, he incurs the risk of coming to a close engagement, which we have supposed him to be sedulously avoiding.\n\nBesides this method of attack from the windward by From the detachments from the main fleet, Mr Clerk shows how leeward, a successful attack may be made by a fleet to leeward, by its breaking the enemy's line, and this either near the rear, near the centre, or not far from the van, of which cases the two former will be most likely to prove successful. The enemy's line can be cut only when the two hostile fleets veer on opposite tacks. The most simple method of effecting this is for the van ship of the attacking squadron, instead of ranging parallel to that of the enemy, and to leeward of him, to pass through the...\nthe first interval that offers, followed by the rest of the line, which is thus led across that of the enemy. In consequence of this manoeuvre, the van of the leeward fleet will be to windward of the enemy's rear, and thus the attacking squadron will have its line entire, while that of its adversary is divided. Again, the ships of the rear division, having their progres obstructed, will probably crowd on each other, get into confusion, and be driven to leeward. We cannot detail the different cases mentioned by Mr Clerk; but for these and many other valuable suggestions on the subject of naval tactics, we must refer to his useful and ingenious Essay.\n\nThe above is a very faint and meagre outline of Mr Clerk's tactics, but it is all which our limits enable us to give. It will afford general readers some idea of the nature of the proposed improvements, and professional men will naturally consult the original essay.\n\nOn these or similar principles is founded the method of breaking through the enemy's line, and thus cutting off a part of his fleet, so successfully adopted by the British admirals in the great naval actions that have distinguished the late and present wars with France. We cannot better illustrate the principles above laid down, than by giving a short detail of the last of these memorable engagements, the Battle of Trafalgar. With this we shall conclude our sketch of naval tactics, and our practical observations on the art of War.\n\nAfter having been long blockaded in the harbour of Cadiz, the combined French and Spanish fleet effected their escape, while the British fleet, under the command of Lord Nelson, was at a considerable distance. On the 19th of October 1805, the ships which had been left to watch the motions of the enemy, communicated to the commander in chief the agreeable intelligence, that the combined fleet had put to sea, and was sailing with light winds in a westerly direction. Lord Nelson concluding that their destination must be the Mediterranean, immediately made all sail with his ships for the entrance of the straits. Here he was informed by Captain Blackwood, that the enemy had not yet passed the straits.\n\nOn the 21st of October, at daylight, Cape Trafalgar bearing east by south about seven leagues distant, the combined fleet was discovered about six or seven miles to the eastward. The wind was about west, and very light. As Lord Nelson had long expected to fall in with the enemy's fleet, he had concerted with his officers the best and most expeditious measures for bringing them to a speedy and decisive action. As soon, therefore, as they hove in sight, he immediately made the signal for the British fleet to bear up in two columns, as they formed in order of sailing. The combined fleet was drawn up in line of battle, with their heads to the northward, and had formed the line with great closeness and correctness. It consisted of 33 ships of the line, 18 French, and 15 Spanish, under Admiral Villeneuve, as commander in chief, who occupied the centre in the Bucentaure, while the Spanish admiral, Gravina, led the rear in the Prince of Asturias. The British fleet consisted of 27 ships, including three sixty-fours. Lord Nelson headed the van in the Victory, having under him the Temeraire, Neptune, Conqueror, Leviathan, Ajax, Orion, Agamemnon, Minotaur, Spartiate, Britannia, Africa, with the Euryalus, Sirius, Phoebe, and Naiad frigates, Pickle schooner, and Entrepreneure cutter; while the rear, consisting of the Royal Sovereign, Mars, Belleisle, Tonissant, Belleroophon, Colossus, Achille, Polyphemus, Revenge, Swiftsure, Defence, Thunderer, Defiance, Prince, and Dreadnought, was led by Vice-admiral Collingwood in the Royal Sovereign.\n\nAs the mode of attack adopted by the British was unusual, the combined fleet was obliged to draw up their line in a new manner. It formed a crescent, with its convexity to leeward, so that in leading down to their centre, the rear division of the British had both their van and rear abaft the beam. Before the action commenced, every alternate ship was about a cable's length to windward of her second ahead and aft, thus forming a kind of double line, and appearing, when on their beam, to leave a small interval between them without crowding their ships. The French and Spaniards were not formed in separate divisions, but intermixed without any apparent regard to order of national squadrons. As the British commander had previously communicated to his flag-officers and captains his preconcerted mode of attack, few signals were necessary, and none were made on approaching the enemy, except to direct close order as the lines bore down.\n\nThe action commenced at noon, by the leading ships of both columns, breaking through the enemy's line, the Victory about the tenth ship from the van, and the Royal Sovereign about the twelfth from the rear; the succeeding ships breaking through in every part after of their leaders, and engaging the enemy at the very muzzles of their guns. By this manoeuvre the van of the enemy was unengaged, and thus the inferiority of the British, in point of number, was of less consequence, while the superior skill and bravery of British seamen soon acquired a decided advantage. The conflict was severe, as the enemy's ships were fought with a gallantry highly honourable to their commanders. The British attack, however, was irresistible. About three P.M. many of the enemy's ships had struck their colours, and their line had given way. Ten ships of the line, and the frigates, under Admiral Gravina, made their escape, and fled to leeward towards Cadiz. The five headmost ships of their van tacked, and, standing to the southward, to windward of the British line, were brought to action, and the sternmost of them taken. Nineteen ships of the line, with three flag-officers, including the commander in chief, remained in the hands of the British. Never was there a victory more glorious or more decisive; never was the pre-eminence of the British flag more triumphantly conspicuous.\n\nThe events subsequent to this memorable battle, and the losses sustained on either side, having little connection with the subject of the present article, need not be here detailed. They are fresh in the memory of our readers, and Britain still laments the loss of her immortal Nelson.\n\n* See Nelson.\nWAR\n\nMan-of-WAR Bird.

He was first put to school there under a Mr Twells, but had the chief part of his education at Okeham in Rutlandshire, where he continued till the beginning of the year 1714, and soon after he was put out clerk to an eminent attorney of Great Markham in Nottinghamshire, where he continued till the year 1719, when he returned to his family at Newark; but whether he practised there or elsewhere as an attorney, is not known.\n\nHe had always expressed a strong inclination to take orders; and the love of letters, which tended to retard, rather than forward, his progress in the profession chosen for him by his friends, growing every day stronger in him, it was deemed expedient to give way to that inclination. He therefore devoted himself to the studies necessary to fit him for the church, and at length in 1723 he was ordained deacon, and priest in 1727.\n\nIn 1728 he was presented by Sir Robert Sutton to the rectory of Brand-Broughton, in the diocese of Lincoln, where he spent the greater part of his life, and composed all the great works which will carry his fame down to posterity. In the same year he was put upon the king's list of Masters of Arts, erected on his majesty's visit to the university of Cambridge. He had already published some juvenile performances, which displayed genius and reading, and attracted considerable notice; but it was not till the year 1736 that he may be said to have emerged from the obscurity of a private life into the notice of the world.\u2014The first publication which rendered him afterwards famous now appeared, under the title of \"The Alliance between Church and State; or, the Necessity and Equity of an Established Religion and a Test Law; demonstrated from the Defence and End of Civil Society, upon the fundamental Principles of the Law of Nature and Nations.\" In *Review of this treatise, says Bishop Horsley *, the author \"hath the Cate of shown the general good policy of an establishment, and the necessity of a Test for its security, upon principles which republicans themselves cannot easily deny. His work is one of the finest specimens that are to be found perhaps in any language, of scientific reasoning applied to a political subject.\"\n\nAt the close of the Alliance was announced the scheme of the Divine Legation of Moses, in which he had then made considerable progress. The first volume of this work was published in January 1737-8, under the title of \"The Divine Legation of Moses demonstrated on the Principles of a religious Deity, from the Ommission of the Doctrine of a future State of Rewards and Punishments in the Jewish Dispensation, in six books, by William Warburton, M. A. author of Vol. XX. Part II.\n\nthe Alliance between Church and State;\" and met Warburton, with a reception which neither the subject, nor the manner in which it was treated, seemed to authorize. It was, as the author afterwards observed, fallen upon in so outrageous and brutal a manner as had been scarcely pardonable, had it been \"The Divine Legation of Mahomet.\"\u2014It produced several answers, and so much abuse from the authors of \"The Weekly Miscellany,\" that in less than two months he was constrained to defend himself, in \"A Vindication of the Author of the Divine Legation of Moses, from the Aspersions of the Country Clergyman's Letter in the Weekly Miscellany of February 24, 1737-8, 8vo.\"\n\nMr Warburton's extraordinary merit had now attracted the notice of the heir apparent to the crown, in whose immediate service we find him in June 1738, when he published \"Faith working by Charity to Christian Edification, a Sermon, preached at the last episcopal Visitation for Confirmation in the Diocese of Lincoln; with a Preface, showing the Reason of its Publication; and a Postscript, occasioned by some Letters lately published in the Weekly Miscellany; by William Warburton M. A. Chaplain to his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales.\"\n\nThe \"Essay on Man\" had now been published some years; and it is universally supposed, that the author had, in the composition of it, adopted the philosophy of Lord Bolingbroke, whom, on this occasion, he had followed as his guide, without understanding the tendency of his principles. In 1738, M. de Croufaz wrote some remarks on it, accusing the author of Spinozism and Naturalism; which falling into Mr Warburton's hands, he published a defence of the first epistle, and soon after of the remaining three, in seven letters; of which five were printed in 1739, and the seventh in June 1740, under the title of \"A Vindication of Mr Pope's Essay on Man, by the author of the Divine Legation.\" The opinion which Mr Pope conceived of these defences, as well as of their author, will be best seen in his letters. In consequence, a firm friendship was established between them, which continued with undiminished fervour until the death of Mr Pope; who, during the remainder of his life, paid a deference and respect to his friend's judgement and abilities, which will be considered by many as almost bordering on fervency.\n\nTowards the end of the year 1739, Mr Warburton published a new and improved edition of the first volume of the Divine Legation; and in 1741, appeared the second part, which completed the argument, though not the entire plan of that work. \"A work, says Bishop Hurd *, in all views of the most transcendant Life of merit, whether we consider the invention or the execution. A plain simple argument, yet perfectly new, proving the divinity of the Mosaic law, and laying a sure foundation for the support of Christianity, is there drawn out to a great length by a chain of reasoning so elegantly connected, that the reader is carried along it with ease and pleasure; while the matter presented to him is so striking for its own importance, so embellished by a lively fancy, and illustrated from all quarters by exquisite learning and the most ingenious disquisition, that in the whole compass of modern or ancient theology, there is nothing equal or similar to this extraordinary performance.\"\n\nThis is the panegyric of a man reflecting with ten-\n\n*Life of Warburton prefixed to his Works.\nWarburton dernes on the memory of his friend and benefactor; but it approaches much nearer to the truth than the censures of those cabalistic critics, who, fattening upon some weak part of the Divine Legation, or perhaps never having looked into it, have ridiculously contended that the author was far from being eminent as a scholar, and that his work is inimical to the cause of Christianity! Putting partiality aside, there is in the Divine Legation of Moles abundant evidence of the malignant folly of this charge, as no man can read and understand that work without being convinced that its author was a Christian, not only sincere but zealous; that he was, what Johnson calls him*, \"a man of vigorous faculties, of a mind fervent and vehement, supplied, by unlimited and incessant inquiry, with a wonderful extent and variety of knowledge, which had neither deprived his imagination nor clouded his perspicuity; and that to every work, and this work in particular, he brought a memory full fraught with a fancy fertile of original combinations, exerting at once the powers of the scholar, the reasoner, and the wit.\" But we think it must be acknowledged, that his learning was too multifarious to be always exact, and his inquiries too eagerly pushed to be always cautious. We have no hesitation, however, to say, that to the divine this great work, with all its imperfections, is, in our opinion, one of the most valuable that is to be found in any language.\n\nIn the summer 1741, Mr Pope and Mr Warburton, in a country ramble, took Oxford in their way. The university was naturally pleased at the arrival of two such strangers, and seemed desirous of enrolling their names among their graduates. The degree of D.D. was intended for the divine, and that of LL.D. for the poet; but intrigue and envy defeated this scheme; and the university lost the honour of decorating at the same time the two greatest geniuses of the age, by the fault of one or two of its members. Pope retired with some indignation to Twickenham, where he confided himself and his friend with this satirical reflection\u2014\u201cWe shall take our degree together in fame, whatever we do at the university.\u201d\n\nThe friendship of this eminent poet was of service to Mr Warburton in more respects than that of increasing his fame. He introduced and warmly recommended him to most of his friends, and among others to Mr Murray, afterwards earl of Mansfield, and Ralph Allen, Esq. of Prior-park. In consequence of this introduction, we find Mr Warburton at Bath 1742; where he printed a sermon which had been preached at the Abbey-church on the 24th of October, for the benefit of Mr Allen\u2019s favourite Charity, the General Hospital or Infirmary. In this year also he printed a Dissertation on the origin of books of chivalry, at the end of Jarvis\u2019s Preface to a translation of Don Quixote, which Mr Pope tells him, he had not got over two paragraphs of, before he cried out, *Aut Erafimus, aut Diabolus.*\n\nIn 1742, Mr Warburton published \u201cA Critical and Philosophical Commentary on Mr Pope\u2019s Essay on Man,\u201d in which is contained a Vindication of the said Essay from the Mephistophelian M. de Resnial, the French Translator, and of M. de Croufaz, Professor of Philosophy and Mathematics in the Academy of Laufanne, the Commentator.\u201d It was at this period, when Mr Warburton had the entire confidence of Mr Pope, that he advised him to complete the Dunciad, by changing Warburton\u2019s hero, and adding to it a fourth book. This was accordingly executed in 1742, and published early in 1743, with notes by our author; who, in consequence of it, received his share of the abuse which Mr Gibber liberally bestowed on both Mr Pope and his annotator. In the latter end of the same year he published complete editions of \u201cThe Essay on Man,\u201d and \u201cThe Essay on Criticism,\u201d and from the specimen which he there exhibited of his abilities, it may be presumed Mr Pope determined to commit the publication of those works which he should leave to Mr Warburton\u2019s care. At Mr Pope\u2019s desire, he, about this time, revised and corrected the \u201cEssay on Homer,\u201d as it now stands in the last edition of that translation.\n\nThe publication of \u201cThe Dunciad\u201d was the last service which our author rendered Mr Pope in his lifetime. After a lingering and tedious illness, the event of which had been long foreseen, this great poet died on the 30th of May 1744; and by his will, dated the 12th of the preceding December, bequeathed to Mr Warburton one half of his library, and the property of all such of his works already printed as he had not otherwise disposed of or alienated, and all the profits which should arise from any edition to be printed after his death: but at the same time directed that they should be published without any future alterations.\n\n\u201cIn 1744, Mr Warburton turned his attention to the several attacks which had been made on the \u201cDivine Legation,\u201d and defended himself in a manner which, if it did not prove him to be possessed of much humility or diffidence, at least demonstrated, that he knew how to wield the weapons of controversy with the hand of a master. His first defence now appeared, under the title of \u201cRemarks on several occasional Reflections, in Answer to the Reverend Dr Middleton, Dr Pococke, the Master of the Charter-House, Dr Richard Grey, and others; serving to explain and justify divers Passages in the Divine Legation, objected to by those learned Writers. To which is added, A General Review of the Argument of the Divine Legation, as far as it is yet advanced; wherein is considered the Relation the several Parts bear to each other and the whole. Together with an Appendix, in Answer to a late Pamphlet intitled, An Examination of Mr W\u2014\u2014\u2019s second Proposition.\u201d This was followed next year by \u201cRemarks on several occasional Reflections, in Answer to the Reverend Doctors Siebbing and Sykes; serving to explain and justify the Two Dissertations in the Divine Legation, concerning the Command to Abraham to offer up his Son, and the Nature of the Jewish Theocracy, objected to by these learned Writers. Part II. and last.\u201d Both these answers are couched in those high terms of confident superiority, which marked almost every performance that fell from his pen during the remainder of his life.\n\nOn the 5th of September 1745, the friendship between him and Mr Allen was more closely cemented by his marriage with Miss Tucker, who survived, and is now, if alive, Mrs Stafford Smith of Prior-park. At that important crisis our author preached and published three excellent sermons: 1. \u201cA faithful Portrait of Popery, by which it is seen to be the Reverse of Christianity, as it is the Destruction of Morality, Piety, and Civil Liberty. Preached at St James\u2019s, Westminster, October\nWAR\n\nWarburton. October 1745.\" 2. \"A Sermon occasioned by the present unnatural Rebellion, &c. Preached in Mr Allen's Chapel at Prior-park, near Bath, November 1745.\"\n3. \"The Nature of National Offences truly stated.\u2014Preached on the General Fast-day, Dec. 18. 1745-6.\"\n\nOn account of the laity of these sermons, he was again involved in a controversy with his former antagonist Dr Stebbing, which occasioned \"An Apologetical Dedication to the Reverend Dr Henry Stebbing, in Answer to his Censure and Misrepresentations of the Sermon preached on the General Fast, &c.\"\n\nNotwithstanding his great connections, his acknowledged abilities, and his established reputation, a reputation founded on the durable basis of learning, and upheld by the decent and attentive performance of every duty incident to his station; yet we do not find that he received any addition to the preferments given him in 1728 by Sir Robert Sutton (except the chaplainship to the prince of Wales), until April 1746, when he was unanimously called by the Society of Lincoln's Inn to be their preacher. In November he published \"A Sermon preached on the Thanksgiving appointed to be observed the 9th of October, for the Suppression of the late unnatural Rebellion.\" In 1747 appeared his edition of Shakespeare and his Preface to Clarissa; and in the same year he published, 1. \"A Letter from an Author to a Member of Parliament concerning Literary Property.\" 2. \"Preface to Mrs Cockburn's Remarks upon the Principles and Reasonings of Dr Rutherford's Essay on the Nature and Obligations of Virtue, &c.\"\n\n3. \"Preface to a Critical Inquiry into the Opinions and Practice of the ancient Philosophers, concerning the Nature of a Future State, and their Method of teaching by double Doctrine,\" (by Mr Towne) 1747, second edition. In 1748, a third edition of \"The Alliance between Church and State, corrected and enlarged.\"\n\n\"In 1749, a very extraordinary attack was made on the moral character of Mr Pope, from a quarter where it could be least expected. An insignificant pamphlet, under the name of A Patriotic King, was that year published by Lord Bolingbroke, or by his direction, with a preface to it, reflecting highly on Mr Pope's honour. The provocation was simply this: The manuscript of that trivial declamation had been intrusted to the care of Mr Pope, with the charge (as it was pretended) that only a certain number of copies should be printed. Mr Pope, in his excessive admiration of his guide, philosopher, and friend, took that opportunity, for fear so invaluable a treasure of patriotic eloquence should be lost to the public, to exceed his commission, and to run off more copies, which were found, after his death, in the printer's warehouse. This charge, however frivolous, was aggravated beyond measure; and, notwithstanding the proofs which Lord Bolingbroke had received of Pope's devotion to him, envenomed with the utmost malignity. Mr Warburton thought it became him to vindicate his deceased friend; and he did it so effectually, as not only to silence his accuser, but to cover him with confusion.\"\n\nAbout this time the publication of Dr Middleton's Inquiry concerning the miraculous Powers of the Christian Church, gave rise to a controversy, which was managed with great warmth and acrimony on both sides, and not much to the credit of either party. On this occasion Mr Warburton published an excellent performance, written with a degree of candour and temper, which, it is to be lamented, he did not always exercise. The title of it was \"Julian; or a Discourse concerning the Earthquake and fiery Eruption which defeated the Emperor's attempt to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem, 1750.\" A second edition of this discourse, \"with Additions,\" appeared in 1751, in which year he gave the public his edition of Mr Pope's Works, with Notes, in nine volumes 8vo; and in the same year printed \"An Answer to a Letter to Dr Middleton, inserted in a Pamphlet intitled, The Argument of the Divine Legation fairly stated,\" &c.; and \"An Account of the Prophecies of Aife Evans, the Welsh Prophet in the last Century,\" annexed to the first volume of Dr Jortin's Remarks on Ecclesiastical History, which afterwards subjected him to much trouble.\n\nIn 1752, Mr Warburton published the first volume of a course of sermons, preached at Lincoln's Inn, intitled, \"The Principles of Natural and Revealed Religion, occasionally opened and explained;\" and this was two years afterwards followed by a second. After the public had been some time promised, it may, from the alarm which was taken, be almost said threatened with, the appearance of Lord Bolingbroke's Works, they were about this time printed. The known abilities and infidelity of this nobleman had created apprehensions in the minds of many people, of the pernicious effects of his doctrines; and nothing but the appearance of his whole force could have convinced his friends, how little there was to be dreaded from arguments against religion so weakly supported. Many answers were soon published, but none with more acuteness, solidity, and sprightliness, than \"A View of Lord Bolingbroke's Philosophy, in two Letters to a Friend, 1754;\" the third and fourth letters were published in 1755, with another edition of the two former; and in the same year a smaller edition of the whole; which, though it came into the world without a name, was universally ascribed to Mr Warburton, and afterwards publicly owned by him. To some copies of this is prefixed an excellent complimentary epistle from the president Montesquieu, dated May 26. 1754.\n\nAt this advanced period of his life, that preferment which his abilities might have claimed, and which had hitherto been withheld, seemed to be approaching towards him. In September 1754, he was appointed one of his majesty's chaplains in ordinary; and in the next year was presented to a prebend in the cathedral of Durham. About this time the degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred on him by Dr Herring, then archbishop of Canterbury. A new impression of The Divine Legation being now called for, he printed a fourth edition of the first part of it, corrected and enlarged, divided into two volumes, with a dedication to the earl of Hardwicke. The same year appeared \"A Sermon preached before his Grace Charles Duke of Marlborough, President, and the Governors of the Hospital for the Smallpox and for Inoculation, at the Parish-church of St Andrew, Holborn, April the 24th, 1755.\" And in 1756, Natural and Civil Events the Instruments of God's Moral Government; a Sermon, preached on the last public Fast-day, at Lincoln's Inn Chapel.\"\n\nIn 1757, Dr Warburton meeting with Mr Hume's tract,\nWAR\n\nWarburton's tract, entitled, The Natural History of Religion, filled the margin of the book, as well as some interleaved slips of paper, with many severe and shrewd remarks on the infidelity and naturalism of the author. These he put into the hands of his friend Dr Hurd, who, making a few alterations of the style, added a short introduction and conclusion, and published them in a pamphlet, entitled, \"Remarks on Mr David Hume's Natural History of Religion, by a Gentleman of Cambridge, in a Letter to the Reverend Dr Warburton.\" This lively attack upon Mr Hume gave him so much offence, that he thought proper to vent his spleen on the supposed author, in the polemical discourse which he called his Life; and thus to do greater honour to Dr Hurd than to any other of his numerous antagonists.\n\nTowards the end of the year 1757, Dr Warburton was promoted to the deanery of Bristol; and in the beginning of the year 1760, he was, through Mr Allen's interest with Mr Pitt, afterwards earl of Chatham, advanced to the bishopric of Gloucester. That great minister is known to have declared, \"that nothing of a private nature, since he had been in office, had given him so much pleasure as bringing our author on the bench.\" There was, however, another minister, who dreaded his promotion, and thought he saw a second Atterbury in the new bishop of Gloucester; but Warburton, says Bishop Hurd, had neither talents nor inclination for parliamentary intrigue or parliamentary eloquence: he had other instruments of fame in his hands, and was infinitely above the vanity of being caught\n\n\"With the fine notion of a busy man.\"\n\nHe was consecrated on the 20th of January 1760, and on the 30th of the same month preached before the house of lords. In the next year he printed \"A Rational Account of the Nature and End of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper.\" In 1762, he published \"The Doctrine of Grace; or the Office and Operations of the Holy Spirit vindicated from the Insults of Infidelity and the Abuses of Fanaticism,\" 2 vols 12mo; and in the succeeding year drew upon himself much illiberal abuse from some writers of the popular party, on occasion of his complaint in the house of lords, on the 15th of November 1763, against Mr Wilkes, for putting his name to certain notes on the infamous \"Essay on Woman.\"\n\nIn 1765 he published a new edition of the second part of the Divine Legation, in three volumes; and as it had now received its last hand, he presented it to his great friend Lord Mansfield, in a dedication which deserves to be read by every person who esteems the well-being of society as a concern of any importance. It was the appendix to this edition which produced the well-known controversy between him and Dr Lowth, which we have noticed elsewhere (see Lowth), as doing no great honour, by the mode in which it was conducted, to either party. In the next year he gave a new and much improved edition of the Alliance between the Church and State. This was followed, in 1767, by a third volume of sermons, to which is added, his first Triennial Charge to the Clergy of the Diocese of Gloucester; which may be safely pronounced one of the most valuable discourses of the kind that is to be found in our own or any other language. With this publication he closed his literary course; except that he made an effort towards publishing, and actually printed, the ninth Warburton and last book of the Divine Legation. This book, with one or two occasional sermons, and some valuable directions for the study of theology, have been given to the world in the splendid edition of his works in seven volumes 4to, by his friend and biographer the present bishop of Worcester. That prelate confesses, that the ninth book of the Divine Legation displays little of that vigour of mind and fertility of invention which appear so conspicuous in the former volumes; but he adds, perhaps truly, that under all the disadvantages with which it appears, it is the noblest effort which has hitherto been made to give a rationale of Christianity.\n\nWhile the bishop of Gloucester was thus exerting his last strength in the cause of religion, he projected a method by which he hoped to render it effectual service after his death. He transferred 500l. to Lord Mansfield, Sir Eardley Wilmot, and Mr Charles Yorke, upon trust, to found a lecture, in the form of a course of sermons, to prove the truth of revealed religion in general, and of the Christian in particular, from the completion of the prophecies in the Old and New Testament, which relate to the Christian church, especially to the apostacy of Papal Rome. To this foundation we owe the admirable Introductory Lectures of Hurd, and the well-adapted Continuation of Halifax and Bagot.\n\nIt is a melancholy reflection, that a life spent in the constant pursuit of knowledge, frequently terminates in the loss of those powers, the cultivation and improvement of which are attended with too strict and unabated a degree of ardour. This was the case with Dr Warburton; and it seems probable that this decline of intellectual vigour was aggravated by the loss of his only son, a promising young man, who died of a consumption but a short time before the bishop, who himself resigned to fate in the year 1779, and in the 81st of his age. A neat marble monument was erected to his memory in the cathedral of Gloucester.","sp":313,"ep":316},{"h":"WARD","t":"Dr Seth, an English prelate, chiefly distinguished for his knowledge in mathematics and astronomy, was born at Buntingford in Hertfordshire, about the year 1617. He was admitted of Sidney college, Cambridge, where he applied with great vigour to his studies, particularly to the mathematics, and was chosen fellow of his college. He was much involved in the consequences of the civil war, but soon after the Restoration obtained the bishopric of Exeter; in 1667, he was translated to Salisbury; and in 1671 was made chancellor of the order of the garter; he was the first Protestant bishop that enjoyed that honour, and he procured it to be annexed to the see of Salisbury. Bishop Ward was one of those unhappy persons who have the misfortune to survive their enemies, which happened in consequence of a fever ill cured; he lived to the Revolution, without knowing anything of the matter, and died in 1690. He was the author of several Latin works in mathematics and astronomy, which were thought excellent in their day; but their use has been superseded by later discoveries and the Newtonian philosophy.\n\nWard, is variously used in our old books: a ward in London is a district or division of the city, committed to the special charge of one of the aldermen; and in London there are 26 wards, according to the number of the mayor and aldermen, of which every one has his\nWAR\n\nWard-hold: his ward for his proper guard and jurisdiction.

See FEODAL System, KNIGHT Service, and TENURE.\n\nUpon the death of a tenant, if the heir was under the age of 21, being a male, or 14, being a female, the lord was intitled to the wardship of the heir, and was called the guardian in chivalry. This wardship consisted in having the custody of the body and lands of such heir, without any account of the profits, till the age of 21 in males, and 16 in females. For the law supposed the heir-male unable to perform knight-service till 21; but as for the female, she was supposed capable at 14 to marry, and then her husband might perform the service. The lord therefore had no wardship, if at the death of the ancestor the heir-male was of the full age of 21, or the heir-female of 14: yet if she was then under 14, and the lord once had her in ward, he might keep her so till 16, by virtue of the statute of Westminster, 1. 3 Edw. I. c. 22. the two additional years being given by the legislature for no other reason but merely to benefit the lord.\n\nThis wardship, so far as it related to land, though it was not nor could be part of the law of feuds, so long as they were arbitrary, temporary, or for life only; yet when they became hereditary, and did consequently often descend upon infants, who by reason of their age could neither perform nor stipulate for the services of the feud, does not seem upon feudal principles to have been unreasonable. For the wardship of the land, or custody of the feud, was retained by the lord, that he might out of the profits thereof provide a fit person to supply the infant's services till he should be of age to perform them himself. And if we consider a feud in its original import, as a stipend, fee, or reward for actual service, it could not be thought hard that the lord should withhold the stipend so long as the service was suspended. Though undoubtedly to our English ancestors, where such stipendiary donation was a mere supposition or figment, it carried abundance of hardship; and accordingly it was relieved by the charter of Henry I. which took this custody from the lord, and ordained that the custody, both of the land and the children, should belong to the widow or next of kin. But this noble immunity did not continue many years.\n\nThe wardship of the body was a consequence of the wardship of the land; for he who enjoyed the infant's estate was the properest person to educate and maintain him in his infancy: and also, in a political view, the lord was most concerned to give his tenant a suitable education, in order to qualify him the better to perform those services which in his maturity he was bound to render.\n\nWhen the male heir arrived at the age of 21, or the heir-female at that of 16, they might sue out their livery or ouster/remain; that is, the delivery of their lands.\nWAR\n\nout of their guardian's hands. For this they were obliged to pay a fine, namely, half-a-year's profits of the land; though this seems expressly contrary to magna charta. However, in consideration of their lands having been so long in ward, they were excused all reliefs, and the king's tenants also all primer seifins. In order to ascertain the profits that arose to the crown by these fruits of nature, and to grant the heir his livery, the itinerant justices, or justices in eyre, had it formerly in charge to make inquisition concerning them by a jury of the county, commonly called an inquisitio post mortem; which was instituted to inquire (at the death of any man of fortune) the value of his estate, the tenure by which it was holden, and who, and of what age, his heir was; thereby to ascertain the relief and value of the primer seifin, or the wardship and livery accruing to the king thereupon. A manner of proceeding that came in process of time to be greatly abused, and at length an intolerable grievance; it being one of the principal accusations against Empson and Dudley, the wicked engines of Henry VII. that by colour of false inquisitions they compelled many persons to sue out livery from the crown, who by no means were tenants thereto. And afterwards a court of wards and liveries was erected, for conducting the same inquiries in a more solemn and legal manner.\n\nWhen the heir thus came of full age, provided he held a knight's fee, he was to receive the order of knighthood, and was compellable to take it upon him, or else pay a fine to the king. For in those heroic times no person was qualified for deeds of arms and chivalry who had not received this order, which was conferred with much preparation and solemnity. We may plainly discover the footsteps of a similar custom in what Tacitus relates of the Germans, who, in order to qualify their young men to bear arms, presented them in a full assembly with a shield and lance; which ceremony is supposed to have been the original of the feudal knighthood. This prerogative, of compelling the vassals to be knighted, or to pay a fine, was expressly recognized in parliament by the statute de militibus, 1 Edw. II.; was exerted as an expedient for raising money by many of our best princes, particularly by Edw. VI. and Queen Elizabeth; but this was the occasion of heavy murmurs when exerted by Charles I.: among whose many misfortunes it was, that neither himself nor his people seemed able to distinguish between the arbitrary stretch and the legal exertion of prerogative. However, among the other concessions made by that unhappy prince before the fatal recourse to arms, he agreed to divest himself of this undoubted flower of the crown; and it was accordingly abolished by statute 16 Car.

It may be issued in extraordinary cases by the privy council, or secretaries of state; but most commonly it is issued by justices of the peace. They may do in any cases where they have a jurisdiction over the offence, in order to compel the person accused to appear before them; for it would be absurd to give them power to examine an offender, unless they had also power to compel him to attend and submit to such examination. And this extends to all treasons, felonies, and breaches of the peace; and also to all such offenses as Comment. they have power to punish by statute. Before the granting of the warrant, it is fitting to examine upon oath the party requiring it, as well to ascertain that there is a felony or other crime actually committed, without which no warrant should be granted; as also to prove the cause and probability of suspecting the party against whom the warrant is prayed.\n\nThis warrant ought to be under the hand and seal of the justice; should set forth the time and place of making, and the cause for which it is made; and should be directed to the constable, or other peace officer, or it may be to any private person by name. A general warrant to apprehend all persons suspected, without naming or particularly describing any person in special, is illegal and void for its uncertainty; for it is the duty of the magistrate, and ought not to be left to the officer, to judge of the ground of suspicion. Also a warrant to appre-\nprehend all persons guilty of such a crime, is no legal warrant; for the point upon which its authority rests, is a fact to be decided on a subsequent trial; namely, whether the person apprehended thereupon be guilty or not guilty. When a warrant is received by the officer, he is bound to execute it, so far as the jurisdiction of the magistrate and himself extends. A warrant from any of the justices of the court of king's bench extends over all the kingdom, and is testified or dated England; but a warrant of a justice of the peace in one county, must be backed, that is, signed, by a justice of another county, before it can be executed there.

He joined the fleet of transports from Boston in Canada bay on the 23rd of April, having under his command the Superb of 60, and the Launcetton and Eltham of 40 guns; he was afterwards joined by several other men of war sent from England, and took possession of Louisbourg on the 17th of June. The French, exasperated at this loss, were constantly on the watch to retake it; and in 1747 fitted out a large fleet for that purpose, and at the same time another squadron to prosecute their success in the East Indies. These squadrons failed at the same time; but the views of the French were rendered abortive by the gallant admiral Anson and Sir Peter Warren, who had been created rear-admiral, who with a large fleet of ships fell in with the French, defeated the whole fleet, and took the greatest part of the men of war.

A man therefore that has the franchise of warren, is in reality no more than a royal game-keeper; but no man, not even a lord of a manor, could by common law justify sporting on another's soil, or even on his own, unless he had the liberty of free-warren. This franchise is almost fallen into disrepute since the new statutes for preserving the game; the name being now chiefly preferred in grounds that are let apart for breeding hares and rabbits.

The air is mild, pleasant, and healthy. The river Avon divides the north part of it, or the Woodlands, from the south, called the Feldon; and the soil of both is rich and fertile. Its productions are corn, malt, wood, wool, cheese, coal, iron, and limestone. The chief rivers of this county are the Avon, Tame, and Arrow. Warwick is the capital; but Birmingham is far superior to it in respect of trade and manufactures, and even to any other town in England.\n\nBirmingham, in this county, of which the account given in the order of the alphabet is very deficient, is one of the most remarkable towns in England, or perhaps in Europe, for the extent, variety, elegance, and utility of its manufactures. This town was little distinguished previous to the reign of Charles II, but since that period it continued to increase in extent and importance. In the year 1700, the number of streets in Birmingham was only 30; they are now nearly 250. In the year 1779 there were only three houses on a particular spot, which in 1791 contained 833.\n\nBirmingham owes its prosperity and population to its manufactures, which are in a great measure the consequence of its vicinity to coal, aided by the spirited and industrious exertions of a few individuals. It has been stated, and no doubt with great truth, that its prosperity is in no small degree indebted to its exemption from the restrictions of borough and corporate laws. To give some notion of the progress and extent of the manufactures of this place, it may be mentioned that the late Mr Taylor, who introduced gilt buttons, japanned, gilt, and painted snuff-boxes, with various articles of manufacture in enamel, died in 1775, at the age of 64, having amassed a fortune of 200,000l. In painting snuff-boxes at so low a rate as one farthing each, one man could gain 3l. 10s. per week. The weekly produce of Mr Taylor's manufacture of buttons amounted to 800l. beside many other valuable and curious productions.\n\nThe manufactory of Messrs Boulton and Watt, which for its extent, variety, and importance, stands unrivalled in Europe, has been already noticed under the word Soho. The new coinage of copper, which has been often deservedly admired, and the re-stamped dollars, are the productions of the Soho manufactory. The first coining mill was erected at Soho in 1783. It is now so much improved, that eight machines driven by the steam-engine, are going on at the same time. Each of these machines strikes from 70 to 84 pieces of the size of a guinea per minute, and hence the whole eight machines work off in one hour between 30,000 and 40,000 coins. The different processes of the machinery are, 1. Rolling the masses of copper into sheets. 2. Rolling them through cylindrical steel rollers. 3. Clipping the pieces of copper for the dye. 4. Shaking the coin in bags. 5. Striking both sides of the coin, and then milling it; after which it is displaced, and another is introduced, to be subjected to the same operation. But the most extraordinary contrivance of this ingenious machinery is, that a precise account of every coin which passes through it is regularly kept, so that it is impossible to practise fraud.\n\nBesides the branches of industry already mentioned, there are manufactories of guns, bayonets, and swords, of sporting guns, of whips, of japan ware, of numerous works in brass and steel, both for ornament and use, and at one time of leather to a considerable extent.\n\nBirmingham contains a museum of natural and artificial curiosities, a handsome theatre, rebuilt since 1791, several churches belonging to the establishment, various dissenting meeting houses, and a number of charitable establishments.

It is situated at the junction of the rivers Potomac and the Eastern Branch, extending about four miles up each, including a tract of territory scarcely to be exceeded, in point of convenience, salubrity, and beauty, by any in the world. This territory, which is called Columbia, lies partly in the state of Virginia, and partly in that of Maryland, and was ceded by those two states to the United States of America, and by them established to be the seat of government after the year 1800. It is divided into squares or grand divisions, by streets running due north and south, and east and west, which form the ground-work of the plan. However, from the Capitol, the president's house, and some of the important areas in the city, run diagonal streets, from one material object to another, which not only produce a variety of charming prospects, but remove the insipid sameness which renders some other great cities unpleasing. The great leading streets are all 160 feet wide, including a pavement of 10 feet, and a gravel walk of 30 feet planted with trees on each side, which will leave 80 feet of paved street for carriages. The rest of the streets are in general...\nWashington, general 110 feet wide, with a few only 90 feet, except North, South, and East Capitol Streets, which are 160 feet. The diagonal streets are named after the respective states composing the Union, while those running north and south are, from the Capitol eastward, named East First Street, East Second Street, &c., and those west of it are in the same manner called West First Street, West Second Street, &c. Those running east and west are from the Capitol northward named North A Street, North B Street, &c., and those south of it are called South A Street, South B Street, &c. The squares or divisions of the city amount to 1150. The rectangular squares generally contain from three to six acres, and are divided into lots of from 40 to 80 feet in front, and their depth from about 110 to 300 feet, according to the size of the square. The irregular divisions produced by the diagonal streets are some of them small, but generally in valuable situations. Their acute points are all to be cut off at 40 feet, so that no house in the city will have an acute corner. All the houses must be of brick or stone. The area for the Capitol (or house for the legislative bodies) is situated upon the most beautiful eminence in the city, about a mile from the Eastern Branch, and not much more from the Potomac, commanding a full view of every part of the city, as well as a considerable extent of the country around. The president's house will stand upon a rising ground, not far from the banks of the Potomac, presenting a delightful water prospect, with a commanding view of the Capitol, and some other material parts of the city.\n\nThe city being situated upon the great post road, exactly equidistant from the northern and southern extremities of the Union, and nearly so from the Atlantic ocean to the river Ohio, upon the best navigation, and in the midst of the richest commercial territory in America, commanding the most extensive internal resources, is by far the most eligible situation for the residence of congress; and it is now pressing forward, by the public-spirited enterprise, not only of the people of the United States, but also of foreigners.\n\nWashington, George, the celebrated commander of the American army, and the first president of the United States, after their separation from the mother-country, was born in the year 1732, in the parish of Washington in Virginia. He was descended from an ancient family in Cheshire, of which a branch was established in Virginia about the middle of the 17th century. Little is known concerning his education, or the early years of his life. Before he was 20 years of age, he was appointed a major in the colonial militia, and had then an opportunity of displaying those military and political talents which have since rendered his name so famous throughout the world. In the disputes which arose between the French and English officers, about settling the limits of Canada and Louisiana, Major Washington was employed by the governor of Virginia as a negociator, and he succeeded in preventing a threatened invasion of the English frontiers by the French and their Indian allies; but, in the following year, when hostilities seemed inevitable, he was appointed lieutenant-colonel, and soon after to the command of a regiment raised by the colony for its own defence. In 1755, Colonel Washington served as a volunteer in the unfortunate expedition of General Braddock, and in that expedition, which was attended with great difficulty, he exhibited so much calmness and intrepidity, that the utmost confidence was reposed in his talents, and perfect obedience paid to his commands by the whole army. After having been employed in a different and more successful expedition to the river Ohio, the state of his health required him, about the year 1758, to resign his military situation; and in the fifteen following years, during which period he married Mrs Custis, a Virginian lady, of amiable character and respectable connections, it would appear that he resided chiefly at his beautiful seat of Mount Vernon, and was occupied in the cultivation of his estate.\n\nWhen the disaffection of the Americans to the British government had become pretty general, and had at last spread to the colony of Virginia, Colonel Washington was appointed a delegate from that state to the congress which met at Philadelphia on the 26th October 1774, and soon after he was appointed to the command of the American army, which had assembled in the provinces of New England. The conduct of Washington during the whole of the war, as well as during the period that he presided in the government of the United States, has been fully detailed in another part of this work, that it would be unnecessary repetition, even to give a general outline of it in this place. See AMERICA.\n\nWashington resigned the presidency in 1796, after having published a farewell address to his countrymen. This address was remarkably distinguished for the simplicity and ingenuousness, moderation and sobriety, the good sense, prudence and honesty, as well as sincere affection for his country and for mankind, which the author of it had always exhibited; it seemed to be a perfect picture of his whole life. From the time of his resignation till the month of July 1798, he lived in retirement at his seat of Mount Vernon. At this period, when the unprincipled actors in the French revolution were carrying on their wicked machinations in every part of the world to which their influence extended, the United States resolved to arm by land and sea in their own defense. General Washington was called from his retirement, and the command of the army was bestowed upon him. This he accepted, because he considered, as he himself expressed it, \"every thing we hold dear and sacred was seriously threatened, although he had flattered himself that he had quitted for ever the boundless field of public action, incessant trouble, and high responsibility, in which he had long acted so conspicuous a part.\" In this situation he continued during the remaining short period of his life. On Thursday the 12th of December 1799, he was seized with an inflammation in the throat, and was carried off Saturday the 14th of the same month, in the 68th year of his age. In his dying moments he displayed the same calmness, simplicity, and regularity, which had uniformly marked his conduct through life. He saw the approaches of death without fear; and he met them without parade. Even the perfectly well ordered state of the minutest particulars of his private business bear the stamp of that constant authority of prudence and practical reason over his actions which was always the most prominent feature of his character.\n\nWashington is the name of many counties, towns, and villages in the American states; a circumstance which affords a striking proof in what degree of esteem\nand veneration the name from which they are derived was held by the inhabitants of the new world.\n\nWASP.

But commonly the name watch is appropriated to such as are carried in the pocket; and clock to the large movements, whether they strike the hour or not. See CLOCK.\n\nThe invention of spring or pocket-watches belongs to the present age. It is true, we find mention made of a watch presented to Charles V. in the history of that prince: but this, in all probability, was no more than a kind of clock to be set on a table, some resemblance whereof we have still remaining in the ancient pieces made before the year 1670. There was also a story of a watch having been discovered in Scotland belonging to King Robert Bruce; but this we believe has turned out altogether apocryphal. The glory of this very useful invention lies between Dr Hooke and M. Huyghens; but to which of them it properly belongs, has been greatly disputed; the English ascribing it to the former, and the French, Dutch, &c. to the latter. Mr Derham, in his Artificial Clockmaker, says roundly, that Dr Hooke was the inventor; and adds, that he contrived various ways of regulation. One way was with a loadstone: another with a tender straight spring, one end whereof played backwards and forwards with the balance; so that the balance was to the spring as the bob to a pendulum, and the spring as the rod thereof: A third method was with two balances, of which there were divers forts; some having a spiral spring to the balance for a regulator, and others without. But the way that prevailed, and which continues in mode, was with one balance, and one spring running round the upper part of the verge thereof: Though this has a disadvantage, which those with two springs, &c. were free from; in that a sudden jerk, or confused shake, will alter its vibrations, and put it in an unusual hurry.\n\nThe time of these inventions was about the year 1658; as appears, among other evidences, from an inscription on one of the double balance watches presented to King Charles II. viz. Rob. Hooke inven. 1658. T. Tompion fecit, 1675. The invention presently got into reputation, both at home and abroad; and two of them were sent for by the dauphin of France. Soon after this, M. Huygens's watch with a spiral spring got abroad, and made a great noise in England, as if the longitude could be found by it. It is certain, however, that his invention was later than the year 1673, when his book de Horol. O'Gillat. was published; wherein he has not one word of this, though he has of several other contrivances in the same way.\n\nOne of these the lord Brouncker sent for out of France, where M. Huygens had got a patent for them. This watch agreed with Dr Hooke's in the application of the spring to the balance; only M. Huygens's had a longer spiral spring, and the pulses and beats were much slower. The balance, instead of turning quite round, as Dr Hooke's, turns several rounds every vibration.\n\nMr Derham suggests, that he has reason to doubt M. Huygens's fancy first was set to work by some intelligence he might have of Dr Hooke's invention from Mr Oldenburgh, or some other of his correspondents in England; and this, notwithstanding Mr Oldenburgh's attempt to vindicate himself in the Philosophical Transactions, appears to be the truth. Huygens invented divers other kinds of watches, some of them without any string or chain at all; which he called, particularly, pendulum watches.\n\nStriking WATCHES are such as, besides the proper watch-part for measuring of time, have a clock-part for striking the hours, &c.\n\nRepeating WATCHES, are such as by pulling a string, &c. repeat the hour, quarter, or minute, at any time of the day or night.\u2014This repetition was the invention of Mr Barlow, and first put in practice by him in larger movements or clocks about the year 1676. The contrivance immediately let the other artists to work, who soon contrived divers ways of effecting the same. But its application to pocket-watches was not known before King James II.'s reign; when the ingenious inventor above mentioned, having directed Mr Thompson to make a repeating watch, was soliciting a patent for the same. The talk of a patent engaged Mr Quare to resume the thoughts of a like contrivance, which he had had in view some years before: he now effected it; and being preffed to endeavour to prevent Mr Barlow's patent, a watch of each kind was produced before the king and council; upon trial of which, the preference was given to Mr Quare's. The difference between them was, that Barlow's was made to repeat by pushing in two pieces on each side the watch-box; one of which repeated the hour, and the other the quarter; whereas Quare's was made to repeat by a pin that stuck out near the pendant, which being thrust in (as now\nWatch. now it is done by thrusting in the pendant itself), repeated both the hour and quarter with the same thrust.\n\nOf the Mechanism of a Watch, properly so called. Watches, as well as clocks, are composed of wheels and pinions, and a regulator to direct the quickness or slowness of the wheels, and of a spring which communicates motion to the whole machine. But the regulator and spring of a watch are vastly inferior to the weight and pendulum of a clock, neither of which can be employed in watches. In place of a pendulum, therefore, we are obliged to use a balance (fig. 1.) to regulate the motion of a watch; and a spring (fig. 2.) which serves in place of a weight, to give motion to the wheels and balance.\n\nThe wheels of a watch, like those of a clock, are placed in a frame formed of two plates and four pillars. Fig. 3. represents the inside of a watch, after the plate (fig. 4.) is taken off. A is the barrel which contains the spring (fig. 2.); the chain is rolled about the barrel, with one end of it fixed to the barrel A (fig. 5.), and the other to the fusee B.\n\nWhen a watch is wound up, the chain which was upon the barrel winds about the fusee; and by this means the spring is stretched; for the interior end of the spring is fixed by a hook to the immovable axis, about which the barrel revolves; the exterior end of the spring is fixed to the inside of the barrel, which turns upon an axis. It is therefore easy to perceive how the spring extends itself, and how its elasticity forces the barrel to turn round, and consequently obliges the chain which is upon the fusee to unfold and turn the fusee; the motion of the fusee is communicated to the wheel C (fig. 5.); then, by means of the teeth, to the pinion c, which carries the wheel D; then to the pinion d, which carries the wheel E; then to the pinion e, which carries the wheel F; then to the pinion f, upon which is the balance-wheel G, whose pivot runs in the pieces A called the potance, and B called a follower, which are fixed on the plate fig. 4. This plate, of which only a part is represented, is applied to that of fig. 3. in such a manner that the pivots of the wheels enter into holes made in the plate fig. 3. Thus the impressed force of the spring is communicated to the wheels; and the pinion f being then connected to the wheel F, obliges it to turn (fig. 5.). This wheel acts upon the palettes of the verge, 1, 2, (fig. 1.), the axis of which carries the balance HH, (fig. 1.). The pivot I, in the end of the verge, enters into the hole c in the potance A (fig. 4.). In this figure the palettes are represented; but the balance is on the other side of the plate, as may be seen in fig. 6.\n\nThe pivot 3 of the balance enters into a hole of the cock BC (fig. 7.), a perspective view of which is represented in fig. 8. Thus the balance turns between the cock and the potance c (fig. 4.), as in a kind of cage. The action of the balance-wheel upon the palettes 1, 2 (fig. 1.), is the same with what we have described with regard to the same wheel in the clock; i.e., in a watch, the balance-wheel obliges the balance to vibrate backwards and forwards like a pendulum. At each vibration of the balance a palette allows a tooth of the balance-wheel to escape; so that the quickness of the motion of the wheels is entirely determined by the quickness of the vibrations of the balance; and these vibrations of the balance and motion of the wheels are produced by the action of the spring.\n\nBut the quickness or slowness of the vibrations of the balance depend not solely upon the action of the great Watch. spring, but chiefly upon the action of the spring a, b, c, called the spiral spring (fig. 9.), situated under the ba-Fig. 9. lance H, and represented in perspective (fig. 6.). The exterior end of the spiral is fixed to the pin a, (fig. 9.) This pin is applied near the plate in a, (fig. 6.); the interior end of the spiral is fixed by a peg to the centre of the balance. Hence if the balance is turned upon itself, the plates remaining immovable, the spring will extend itself, and make the balance perform one revolution. Now, after the spiral is thus extended, if the balance be left to itself, the elasticity of the spiral will bring back the balance, and in this manner the alternate vibrations of the balance are produced.\n\nIn fig. 5. all the wheels above described are represented in such a manner, that you may easily perceive at first sight how the motion is communicated from the barrel to the balance.\n\nIn fig. 10. are represented the wheels under the dial-Fig. 10. plate by which the hands are moved. The pinion a is adjusted to the force of the prolonged pivot of the wheel D (fig. 5.), and is called a cannon pinion. This wheel revolves in an hour. The end of the axle of the pinion a, upon which the minute-hand is fixed, is square; the pinion (fig. 10.) is indented into the wheel b, which is carried by the pinion a. Fig. 11. is a wheel fixed upon Fig. 11. a barrel, into the cavity of which the pinion a enters, and upon which it turns freely. This wheel revolves in 12 hours, and carries along with it the hour-hand. For a full account of the principles upon which watches and all time-keepers are constructed, we must refer our readers to a short treatise, entitled Thoughts on the Means of improving Watcher, by Thomas Mudge.\n\nWATCH-Glass, in a ship, are glasses employed to measure the period of the watch, or to divide it into any number of equal parts, as hours, half-hours, &c. so that the several stations therein may be regularly kept and relieved, as at the helm, pump, look-out, &c.\n\nWATCH-Work. There is one part of the movements of clocks and watches of which we have yet given no particular account. This is the method of applying the maintaining power of the wheels to the regulator of the motions, so as not to injure its power of regulation. This part of the construction is called SCAPEMENT, and falls to be described under the present article, to which we have referred from SCAPEMENT.\n\nThe motions of a clock or watch are regulated by a Objects of pendulum or balance, without which check the wheels' escapements impelled by the weight in the clock, or spring in the watch, would run round with a rapidly accelerating motion, till this should be rendered uniform by friction, and the resistance of the air. If, however, a pendulum or balance be put in the way of this motion, in such a manner that only one tooth of a wheel can pass, the revolution of the wheels will depend on the vibration of the pendulum or balance.\n\nWe cannot here enter on an historical account of the improvements that have been made on the regulating powers of clocks and watches, nor can we detail the principles on which their action depends. It will be sufficient here to notice the most simple construction of escapements, and then to describe two or three of the most improved constructions that have been applied to time-keepers.\n\nWe know that the motion of a pendulum or balance\nis alternate, while the pressure of the wheels is constantly exerted in the same direction. Hence it is evident that some means must be employed to accommodate these different motions to each other. Now, when a tooth of the wheel has given the pendulum or balance a motion in one direction, it must quit it, that the pendulum or balance may receive an impulsion in the opposite direction. This escape of the tooth has given rise to the term escapement.\n\nThe ordinary escapement is extremely simple, and may be thus illustrated. Let \\( x y \\) fig. 12. Plate DLXXI. represent a horizontal axis, to which the pendulum \\( p \\) is attached by a slender rod. This axis has two leaves \\( c \\) and \\( d \\), one near each end, and not in the same plane, but so that when the pendulum hangs perpendicularly at rest, \\( c \\) spreads a few degrees to the right, and \\( d \\) as much to the left. These are called the pallets. Let \\( a f b \\) represent a wheel, turning on a perpendicular axis \\( e o \\) in the order \\( a f e b \\). The teeth of this wheel are in the form of those of a saw, leaning forward in the direction of the rim's motion. This wheel is usually called the crown-wheel, or in watches the balance-wheel. See CLOCK and WATCH. It generally contains an odd number of teeth. In the figure the pendulum is represented at the extremity of its excursion towards the right, the tooth \\( a \\) having just escaped from the pallet \\( c \\), and \\( b \\) having just dropped on \\( d \\). Now it is evident that while the pendulum is moving to the left, in the arch \\( p g \\), the tooth \\( b \\) still presses on the pallet \\( d \\); and thus accelerates the pendulum, both in its descent along \\( p h \\), and its ascent up \\( h g \\), and that when \\( d \\), by turning round the axis \\( x y \\), raises its point above the plane of the wheel, the tooth \\( b \\) escapes from it, and \\( i \\) drops on \\( c \\), now nearly perpendicular. Thus \\( c \\) is pressed to the right, and the motion of the pendulum along \\( g p \\) is accelerated. Again, while the pendulum hangs perpendicularly in the line \\( x h \\), the tooth \\( b \\), by pressing on \\( d \\), will force the pendulum to the left, in proportion to its lightness, and if it be not too heavy, will force it so far from the perpendicular, that \\( b \\) will escape, and \\( i \\) will catch on \\( c \\), and force the pendulum back to \\( p \\), when the same motion will be repeated. This effect will be more remarkable, if the rod of the pendulum be continued through \\( x y \\), and have a ball \\( q \\) on the other end, to balance \\( p \\). When \\( b \\) escapes from \\( d \\), the balls are moving with a certain velocity and momentum, and in this condition the balance is checked when \\( i \\) catches on \\( c \\). It is not, however, instantly stopped, but continues to move a little to the left, and \\( i \\) is forced a little backward by the pallet \\( c \\). It cannot make its escape over the top of the tooth \\( i \\), as all the momentum of the balance was generated by the force of \\( b \\), and \\( i \\) is of equal power. Besides, when \\( i \\) catches on \\( c \\), and the motion of \\( c \\) to the left continues, the lower point of \\( c \\) is applied to the face of \\( i \\), which now acts on the balance by a long lever, soon stops its motion in that direction, and continuing to press on \\( c \\), urges the balance in the opposite direction. It is easy to see that the motion of the wheel here must be hobbling and unequal, which has given to this escapement the name of the recoiling escapement.\n\nIn considering the utility of the following improved escapement for clocks, we must keep in mind the following proposition, which, after the above illustration, scarcely requires any direct proof. It is, that the natural vibrations of a pendulum are isochronous, or are performed in equal times. The great object of the escapement is to preserve this isochronous motion of the pendulum.\n\nAs the defect of the recoiling escapement was long apparent, several ingenious artists attempted to substitute Cumming's in its place a escapement that should produce a more regular and uniform motion. Of these, the escapement contrived by Mr Cumming appears to be one of the most ingenious in its construction, and most perfect in its operation. The following construction is similar to that of Mr Cumming but rendered rather less complex for the purpose of shortening the description.\n\nLet \\( A B C \\), fig. 13, represent a portion of the swing wheel, of which \\( O \\) is the centre, and \\( A \\) one of the teeth; \\( Z \\) is the centre of the crutch, pallets, and pendulum. The crutch is represented of the form of the letter \\( A \\), having in the circular cross piece a slit \\( k \\), also circular, \\( Z \\) being the centre. The arm \\( Z F \\) forms the first detent, and the tooth \\( A \\) is represented as locked on it at \\( F \\). \\( D \\) is the first pallet on the end of the arm \\( Z d \\), moveable round the same centre with the detents, but independent of them. The arm \\( d e \\) to which the pallet \\( D \\) is attached, lies wholly behind the arm \\( Z F \\) of the detent, being fixed to a round piece of brass \\( e f g \\), having pivots turning concentric with the axis of the pendulum. To the same piece of brass is fixed the horizontal arm \\( e H \\), carrying at its extremity the ball \\( H \\), of such size, that the action of the tooth \\( A \\) on the pallet \\( D \\) is just able to raise it up to the position here drawn. \\( Z P p \\) represents the fork, or pendulum rod, behind both detent and pallet. A pin \\( p \\) projects forward, coming through the slit \\( k \\), without touching either margin of it. Attached to the fork is the arm \\( m n \\), of such length that, when the pendulum rod is perpendicular, the angular distance of \\( n g \\) from the rod \\( e q H \\) is just equal to the angular distance of the left side of the pin \\( p \\) from the left end \\( i \\) of the slit \\( k \\).\n\nNow, the natural position of the pallet \\( D \\) is at \\( 8 \\), represented by the dotted lines, resting on the back of the detent \\( F \\). It is naturally brought into this position by its own weight, and still more by the weight of the ball \\( H \\). The pallet \\( D \\), being set on the foreside of the arm at \\( Z \\), comes into the same plane with the detent \\( F \\) and the swing-wheel, though here represented in a different position. The tooth \\( C \\) of the wheel is supposed to have escaped from the second pallet, on which the tooth \\( A \\) immediately seizes the pallet \\( D \\), situated at \\( 8 \\), forces it out, and then rests on the detent \\( F \\), the pallet \\( D \\) leaning on the tip of the tooth. After the escape of \\( C \\), the pendulum, moving down the arch of semivibration, is represented as having attained the vertical position. Proceeding still to the left, the pin \\( p \\) reaches the extremity \\( i \\) of the slit \\( k \\); and, at the same instant, the arm \\( n \\) touches the rod \\( e H \\) in \\( g \\). The pendulum proceeding a hairsbreadth further, withdraws the detent \\( F \\) from the tooth, which now even pushes off the detent, by acting on the inclining face of it. The wheel being now unlocked, the tooth following \\( C \\) on the other side acts on its pallet, pushes it off, and rests on its detent, which has been rapidly brought into a proper position by the action of \\( A \\) on the inclining face of \\( F \\). By a similar action of \\( C \\) on its detent at the moment of escape, \\( F \\) was brought into a position proper for the wheels being locked by the tooth \\( A \\). As the pendulum still goes on, the ball \\( H \\), and pallet connected with it, are carried by the arm \\( m n \\), and before the pin \\( p \\) again reaches the end...\nend of the slit, which had been suddenly withdrawn by\nthe action of A on F, the pendulum comes to rest. It\nnow returns towards the right, loaded with the ball H\non the left, and thus the motion lost during the last vi-\nbration is restored. When the pin p, by its motion to\nthe right, reaches the end k of t k, the wheel on the\nright side is unlocked, and at the same instant the weight\nH being raised from the pendulum by the action of a\ntooth like B on the pallet D, ceases to act.\n\nIn this escapement, both pallets and detents are de-\ntached from the pendulum, except in the moment of un-\nlocking the wheel, so that, except during this short in-\nterval, the pendulum may be said to be free during its\nwhole vibration, and of course its motion must be more\nequable and undisturbed.\n\nThe constructing of a proper escapement for watches\nrequires peculiar delicacy, owing to the small size of the\nmachine, from which the error of \\( \\frac{1}{360} \\) of an inch has as\nmuch effect as the error of a whole inch in a common\nclock. From the necessary lightness of the balance, too,\nit is extremely difficult to accumulate a sufficient quan-\ntity of regulating power. This can be done only by\ngiving the balance a great velocity, which is effected by\nconcentrating as much as possible of its weight in the\nrim, and making its vibrations very wide. The balance\nrim of a tolerable watch should pass through at least ten\ninches in every second.\n\nIn considering the most proper escapements for watches,\nwe may assume the following principle, viz., that the o-\nscillations of a balance urged by its spring, and undisturbed\nby extraneous forces, are isochronous.\n\nIn ordinary pocket watches, the common recoil-\ning escapement of clocks is still employed, and answers\nthe common purposes of a watch tolerably well, so that, if\nproperly executed, a good ordinary watch will keep time\nwithin a minute in the day. These watches, however,\nare subject to great variation in their rate of going, from\nany change in the power of the wheels.\n\nThe following is considered as the best construction\nof the common watch escapement, and is represented by\nfig. 14, as it appears when looking straight down on the\nend of the balance arbor. C marks the centre of the\nbalance and verge; CA represents the upper pallet, or\nthat next the balance, and CB the lower pallet; F and\nD are two teeth of the crown wheel, moving from left\nto right; E, G, are two teeth in the lower part, moving\nfrom right to left. The tooth D appears as having just\nescaped from the point of C A, and the tooth E as\nhaving just come in contact with CB. In practice, the\nescapement should not be quite so close, as by a small in-\nequality of the teeth, D might be kept from escaping at\nall. The following are thought the best proportions:\nThe distance between the front of the teeth (that is, of\nG, F, E, D), and the axis C of the balance, is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of F A,\nthe distance between the points of the teeth. The\nlength CA, CB of the pallets is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of the same degrees,\nand the front DH or FK of the teeth makes an angle of\n\\( 25^\\circ \\) with the axis of the crown wheel. The sloping\nside of the tooth must be of an epicycloidal form, fitted\nto the relative motion of the tooth and pallet.\n\nIt appears from these proportions, that by the action\nof the tooth D, the pallet A can throw out till it reach\n\\( 120^\\circ \\) from CL, the line of the crown-wheel axis. To\nthis if we add BCA = \\( 95^\\circ \\), we shall have LC = \\( 125^\\circ \\).\nAgain, B will throw out as far on the other side.\n\nNow, if from \\( 240^\\circ \\) the sum of the extent of vibration\nof both pallets, we take \\( 95^\\circ \\) the angle of the pallets,\nthe remainder \\( 145^\\circ \\) will express the greatest vibration\nwhich the balance can make, without striking the front\nof the teeth. From several causes, however, this mea-\nsure is too great, and \\( 120^\\circ \\) is reckoned a sufficient vibra-\ntion in the best ordinary escapement.\n\nOf the improvements on the escapements of watches, Graham's\none of the most important is that by Mr George Graham,\nwhich we shall proceed to describe. DE, fig. 15,\nrepresents part of the rim of the balance wheel; A and Fig. 15, and\nC, two of its teeth with their faces b e formed into\nplanes, inclined to the circumference of the wheel in an\nangle of about \\( 15^\\circ \\), so that the length b e of the face\nmay be nearly quadruple of its height e m. Let a cir-\ncular arch ABC be described round the centre of the\nwheel, and through the middle of the faces of the teeth.\nThe axis of the balance will pass through same point B\nof this arch, and the mean circumference of the teeth\nmay be said to pass through the centre of the verge. On\nthis axis is fixed a portion of a thin hollow cylinder b c d\nmade of hard tempered steel, or of some hard and tough\nstone, such as ruby or sapphire. By this construction\nthe portion of the cylinder occupies \\( 210^\\circ \\) of the circum-\nference. The edge b, to which the tooth approaches\nfrom without, is rounded off on both angles. The\nother edge d is formed into a plane, inclined to the ra-\ndius about \\( 30^\\circ \\). Now, suppose the wheel pressed for-\nward in the direction AC, the point b of the tooth,\ntouching the rounded edge, will push it outwards, turn-\ning round the balance in the direction b c d. The\nheel e of the tooth will escape from this edge when it is\nin the position h, and e is in the position f. The point b\nof the tooth will now be at d, but the edge of the cy-\nlinder will be at i. The tooth therefore rests in the in-\nside of the cylinder, while the balance continues its vi-\nbration a little way, in consequence of the impulse it\nhas received from the action of the inclined plane.\nWhen this vibration is ended, by the opposition of the\nbalance spring, the balance will return, and the tooth\nnow in the position B, rubbing on the inside of the cy-\nlinder, the balance comes back into its natural posi-\ntion b c d, with an accelerated motion by the action of\nits spring, and would of itself vibrate as far as the other\nside. It is, however, assisted again by the tooth, which\nprecedes on the edge d, pushes it aside till it attain the posi-\ntion k, when the tooth entirely escapes from the cylin-\nder. At this instant the other edge of the cylinder,\nhaving attained the position l, is in the way of the next\ntooth, which is now in the position A, while the balance\ncontinues its vibration; the tooth resting and rubbing on\nthe outside of the cylinder. When this vibration is fin-\nished, the balance, by the action of the spring, resumes its\nfirst motion, and as soon as the balance gets into its na-\ntural position, the tooth begins to act on the edge b,\npushes it aside, escapes from it, and drops as before in the\ninside of the cylinder. In this construction the arch of\naction or escapement is \\( 30^\\circ \\) = twice the angle which the\nface of a tooth makes with the circumference.\n\nIt is necessary to explain how the cylinder is connect-\ned with the verge, so as to make such a great revolution\nround the tooth of the wheel. The triangular tooth\ne b m is placed on the top of a little pillar fixed into\nthe end of the piece of brass m D formed in the rim of\nthe wheel. Thus the plane of the wedge tooth is pa-\nrallel.\nrallied to the plane of the wheel, but at a small distance above it. The verge is represented at fig. 16, and consists of a long hollow cylinder of hard steel, having a great portion of the metal cut out. If spread out flat, this cylinder would assume the form of fig. 17; and if we conceive this flat piece rolled up till the edges GH and G'H' unite, we shall have the exact form. The part acted on by the point of the tooth is denoted by the dotted line b d, and the part D, I, F, E, serves to connect the two ends.\n\nThis escapement of Mr Graham is called a horizontal escapement, because the balance is parallel to the other wheels.\n\nAnother escapement of a superior construction was contrived by M. Lepaute of Paris, and is of such a singular form as to render it extremely difficult to illustrate it by a figure. The representations at figs. 18 and 19 will, however, give general readers some idea of its mode of action, and a skilful artist will easily see how the several parts may be adapted to each other. ABC fig. 18 represents part of the rim of the balance wheel, having the pins 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &c., projecting from its faces; the pins 1, 3, 5, being on the side next the eye, and the pins 2 and 4 on the opposite side. D is the centre of the balance and verge, and the small circle round D represents its thickness. But the verge in this place is crooked, that the rim of the wheel may not be intercepted by it. To it is attached a piece of hard tempered steel a b c d, of which the part a b c is a concave arch of a circle, having D for its centre. It wants about 30\u00b0 of a semicircle. The rest c d is also an arch of a circle, having the same radius with the balance wheel. In the natural position of the balance, a line drawn from D through the middle of the face c d, is a tangent to the circumference of the wheel. But if the balance be turned round, till the point d of the horn come to d', and the point e come to 2, in the circumference in which the pins are placed, the pin prefling on the beginning of the horn or pallet, pushes it aside, slides along it, and escapes at d, having generated a certain velocity in the balance. Let another pallet similar to that now described be placed on the other side of the wheel, but in a contrary position, with the acting face of the pallet turned away from the centre of the wheel. Let it be so placed at E, that the moment the pin 1 on the upper side of the wheel escapes from the pallet c d, the pin 4 on the lower side of the wheel falls on the end of the circular arch e f g of the other pallet. Now, if the pallets be connected by equal pulleys G and F on the axis of each, and a thread round both, so that they shall turn one way; the balance on the axis D, having received an impulse from the pin 1, will continue its motion from A towards i, and will carry the other pallet with a similar motion round the centre E from h to k. The pin 4 will therefore rest in the concave arch g f e as the pallet turns round. When the force of the balance is spent, the pallet c d returns towards its first position. The pallet g h turns with it, and when the point of the first has arrived at d, the beginning p of the other arrives at the pin 4; and proceeding farther, this pin escapes from the concave arch e f g, and slides along the pallet g h, pushing it aside, and of course urging the pallet round the centre E, and the balance on the axis D round at the same time, and in the same direction. The pin 4 escapes from the pallet g h, when h arrives at 3; but while the pin 4 is sliding along the yielding pallet g h, the pin 3 is moving in the circumference BDA; and the instant that the pin 4 escapes from h at 3, the pin 3 arrives at 2, where the beginning c of the concave arch c b is ready, to receive it. It therefore rests on this arch, while the balance continues its motion, and this may continue till the point b of the arch comes to 2. The balance now flops, its force being spent, and then returns; and the pin 3 escapes from the circle at c, slides along the yielding pallet c d, and when it escapes at 1, another pin on the lower side of the wheel arrives at 4, and finds the arch g f e ready to receive it. And thus the vibration of the balance will be continued.\n\nFrom the above description we may deduce the proper dimensions of the parts of the pallet. Thus, the length of the pallet c d or g h, must be equal to the interval between two succeeding pins, and the distance of the centres D, E, must be double of that interval. The radius D e or E g, may be as small as we choose. The concave arches c b a and g f e, must be continued so far as to allow a pin to rest on them during the whole excursion of the balance. The angle of escapement, in which the balance remains under the influence of the wheels, is obtained by drawing the lines D c and D d, and we shall find that this angle c D d is here about 30\u00b0, though it may be made either greater or less than this.\n\nFig. 19 explains how the two pallets may be combined on one verge. KL is the verge with a pivot at each end. It is bent like a crank MNO, to admit the balance wheel between its branches. BC represents this wheel, seen edgewise, with its pin alternately on different faces. The pallets are also represented by b c d and h g f, fixed to the inside of the branches of the crank, facing each other. The position of their acting faces may be seen in the preceding figure, on the verge D, where the pallet g h is represented by the dotted line 2 i, as situated behind the pallet c d. The remote pallet 2 i is so placed, that when the point d of the near pallet is quitted by a pin 1 on the upper side of the wheel, the angle formed by the face and the arch of rest of the other pallet is just ready to receive the next pin 2, which lies on the lower side of the rim. It is plain that the action here will be the same as if the pallets were on separate axes. The pin 1 escapes from d, and the pin 2 is received on the arch of rest, and locks the wheel, while the balance continues in motion. When the balance returns, 2 gets off the arch of rest, pushes aside the pallet 2 i, escapes from it when i gets to 1, and then the point c is ready to receive the pin 3, &c. The vibrations may be increased by giving a sufficient impulse through the angle of escapement, but they cannot exceed a certain quantity, otherwise N, the top of the crank, would strike the rim of the wheel. The vibrations may be easily increased to 180\u00b0, by placing the pins at the very edge of the wheel; and by placing them at the points of long teeth, so that the crank may get in between them, the vibrations may be carried to a much greater extent.\n\nThe construction just described is exceedingly ingenious; and if the machinery be well executed, this escapement will excel the horizontal escapement of Graham, both as it has but two acting faces to form, and as it admits of making the circle of rest extremely small, without lessening the acting face of the pallet. The construction is, however, very delicate and difficult, and must require a very nice workman.\nAn excellent escapement of much more easy construction, is that commonly called Duplaie's escapement, and with this we shall conclude our account of watch-work.\n\nFig. 20 represents the essential parts somewhat magnified. AD is a portion of the balance-wheel, having teeth f, h, g, at the circumference. These teeth are for producing the rep of the wheel, while the balance is making excursions beyond the escapement. This is effected by an agate cylinder s p g, on the verge. This cylinder has a notch o. When the cylinder turns round in the direction s p g, the notch easily passes the tooth B which is resting on the cylinder surface; but when it returns in the direction q p o, the tooth B gets into the notch, and follows it, pressing on one side of it till the notch comes into the position o. The tooth being then in the position h, escapes from the notch, and another tooth drops on the convex surface of the cylinder at B. The balance-wheel is also furnished with a set of flat-sided pins, standing upright on its rim represented by a D. There is likewise fixed on the verge a larger cylinder G F C above the smaller one o p q, with its lower surface clear of the wheel, and having a pallet C, of sapphire, firmly indented into it, and projecting so far as to keep clear of the pins on the wheel. The position of this cylinder, with respect to the smaller one below it, is such that the tooth b being escaped from the notch, the pallet C has just past the pin a, which was at A while B rested on the small cylinder; but it moved from A to a, while B moved to b. The wheel being now at liberty, the pin a exerts its pressure on the pallet C in the most direct manner, and gives it a strong impulsion, following and accelerating it till another tooth stops on the little cylinder. The angle of escapement depends partly on the projection of the pallet, and partly on the diameter of the small cylinder, and the advance of the tooth B into the notch. Independent of the action on the small cylinder, the angle of escapement would be the whole arch of the larger cylinder between C and x. But a stops before it be clear of the pallet, and the arch of impulsion is shortened by all the space described by the pin while a tooth moves from B to b. It stops at d.\n\nFor an account of other escapements we must refer our readers to the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences at Paris for 1748, Cumming's Elements of Clock and Watchwork, a French work entitled Machines approuv\u00e9es par l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, and Young's Lectures on Natural Philosophy, vol. i. p. 193, and Plate 16, vol. ii. p. 193.","sp":322,"ep":331},{"h":"WATCHING","t":"in Medicine, is when the patient cannot sleep.

It is essential to animal and vegetable life; it makes easy the intercourse between the most distant regions of the world; and it is one of the most useful powers in the mechanic arts. It is often found combined with various substances, and is then frequently beneficial in curing or alleviating diseases.\n\nThose properties of water which fit it for answering mechanical purposes are explained in other articles of this Work (see Hydrodynamics, Pneumatics, No. 3, Water, Resistance, and Rivers); and for the discovery of the composition of water, see Chemistry Index.\n\nMineral Waters. For the method of analysing them, see also Chemistry Index.\n\nUnder the title of Mineral Waters, we have given an analysis of the most remarkable waters in Europe.\n\nHoly Water, which is made use of in the church of Rome, as also by the Greeks, and by the other Christians of the East of all denominations, is water with a mixture of salt, blessed by a priest according to a set form of benediction. It is used in the blessing of persons, things, and places; and is likewise considered as a ceremony to excite pious thoughts in the minds of the faithful.\n\nThe priests, in blessing it, first, in the name of God, commands the devils not to hurt the persons who shall be sprinkled with it, nor to abuse the things, nor disturb the places, which shall likewise be so sprinkled. He then prays that health, safety, and the favour of heaven, may be enjoyed by such persons, and by those who shall use such things, or dwell in such places. Veements, vessels, and other such things that are let apart for divine service, are sprinkled with it. It is sometimes sprinkled on cattle, with an intention to free or preserve them from diabolical enchantments; and in some ritual books there are prayers to be said on such occasions, by which the safety of such animals, as being a temporal blessing to the possessors, is begged of God, whose providential care is extended to all his creatures.\n\nThe hope which Catholics entertain of obtaining such good effects from the devout use of holy water, is grounded on the promise made to believers by Christ (St Mark xvi. 17), and on the general efficacy of the prayers of the church; the petition of which prayers God is often pleased to grant; though sometimes, in his Providence, he sees it not expedient to do so. That such effects have been produced by holy water in a remarkable manner, has been asserted by many authors of no small weight; as, namely, by St Epiphanius, Haer. 30th; St Hieron., in the Life of St Hilarion; Theodorest Hist. Eccl. lib. v. cap. 21.; Palladius, Hist. Lauf.; Bede, lib. v. cap. 4.\n\nAs a ceremony (says the Catholic), water brings to our remembrance our baptism; in which, by water, we were cleansed from original sin. It also puts us in mind of that purity of conscience which we ought to endeavour always to have, but especially when we are going to worship our God. The salt, which is put into the water to preserve it from corrupting, is also a figure of divine grace, which preserves our souls from the corruption of sin; and is likewise an emblem of that wisdom and discretion which ought to season every action that a Christian does, and every word that he says. It is wont to be blessed and sprinkled in churches on Sundays, in the beginning of the solemn office. It is kept in vessels at the doors of the same churches, that it may be taken by the faithful as they enter in. It is also often kept in private houses and chambers.\n\nPutrid Water, is that which has acquired an offensive smell and taste by the putrefaction of animal or vegetable substances contained in it. It is in the highest degree pernicious to the human frame, and capable of bringing on mortal diseases even by its smell. It is not always from the apparent muddiness of waters than we can.\ncan judge of their disposition to putrefy; some which are seemingly very pure being more apt to become putrid than others which appear much more mixed with heterogeneous matters. Under the article ANIMALCULE, No. 33, is mentioned a species of insects which have the property of making water stink to an incredible degree, though their bulk in proportion to the fluid which surrounds them is less than that of one to a million. Other substances no doubt there are which have the same property; and hence almost all water which is confined from the air is apt to become offensive, even though kept in glass or stoneware vessels. Indeed it is a common observation, that water keeps much longer sweet in glass vessels, or in those of earthen or stoneware, than in those of wood, where it is exceedingly apt to putrefy. Hence, as ships can only be supplied with water kept in wooden casks, sailors are extremely liable to those difficulties which arise from putrid water; and the discovery of a method by which water could easily be prevented from becoming putrid at sea would be exceedingly valuable. This may indeed be done by quicklime; for when water is impregnated with it, all putrefactive matters are either totally destroyed, or altered in such a manner as never to be capable of undergoing the putrefactive fermentation again. But a continued use of lime-water could not fail of being pernicious, and it is therefore necessary to throw down the lime; after which the water will have all the purity necessary for preserving it free from putrefaction. This can only be done by means of fixed air; and mere exposure in broad shallow vessels to the atmosphere would do it without any thing else, only taking care to break the crust which formed upon it.\n\nTwo methods, however, have been thought of for doing this with more expedition. The one, invented by Dr. Alston, is, by throwing into the water impregnated with lime a quantity of magnesia. The lime attracts fixed air more powerfully than magnesia; in consequence of which the latter parts with it to the lime; and thus becoming insoluble, falls along with the caustic magnesia to the bottom, and thus leaves the water perfectly pure. Another method is that of Mr. Henry, who proposes to throw down the lime by means of an effervescing mixture of oil of vitriol and chalk put down to the bottom of the water cask. His apparatus for this purpose is as simple as it can well be made, though it is hardly probable that sailors will give themselves the trouble of using it; and Dr. Alston's scheme would seem better calculated for them, were it not for the expense of the magnesia; which indeed is the only objection made to it by Mr. Henry. Putrid water may be restored and made potable by a process of the same kind.\n\nOf late it has been discovered that charcoal possesses many unexpected properties, and, among others, that of preserving water from corruption, and of purifying it after it has been corrupted. Mr. Lowitz, whose experiments on charcoal have been published in Crell's Chemical Journal, has turned his attention to this subject in a memoir read to the Economical Society at Peterburgh. He found that the effect of charcoal was rendered much more speedy by using along with it some sulphuric acid. One ounce and a half of charcoal in powder, and 24 drops of concentrated sulphuric acid (oil of vitriol), are sufficient to purify three pints and a half of corrupted water, and do not communicate to it any sensible acidity. This small quantity of acid renders it unnecessary to use more than a third part of the charcoal powder which would otherwise be wanted; and the less of that powder is employed, the less is the quantity of water lost by the operation, which, in sea-voyages, is an object worthy of consideration. In proportion to the quantity of acid made use of, the quantity of charcoal may be diminished or augmented. All acids produce nearly the same effects: neutral salts also, particularly nitre and sea-salt, may be used, but sulphuric acid is preferable to any of these; water which is purified by means of this acid and charcoal will keep a longer time than that which is purified by charcoal alone. When we mean to purify any given quantity of corrupted water, we should begin by adding to it as much powder of charcoal as is necessary to deprive it entirely of its bad smell. To ascertain whether that quantity of powdered charcoal was sufficient to effect the clarification of the said water, a small quantity of it may be passed through a linen bag, two or three inches long; if the water, thus filtrated, still has a turbid appearance, a fresh quantity of powdered charcoal must be added, till it becomes perfectly clear: the whole of the water may then be passed through a filtering bag, the size of which should be proportioned to the quantity of water. If sulphuric acid, or any other, can be procured, a small quantity of it should be added to the water, before the charcoal powder.\n\nThe cleaning of the casks in which water is to be kept in sea-voyages should never be neglected: they should be well washed with hot water and sand, or with any other substance capable of removing the mucilaginous particles, and afterwards a quantity of charcoal dust should be employed, which will entirely deprive them of the musty or putrid smell they may have contracted.\u2014The charcoal used for purifying water should be well burnt, and afterwards beat into a fine powder.\n\nSea-Water. See SEA-Water.\n\nWater-Carts, carriages constructed for the purpose of watering the roads for several miles round London; a precaution absolutely necessary near the metropolis, where, from such a vast daily influx of carriages and horses, the dust would otherwise become quite insufferable in hot dry weather.

Hence there is no resource for the crew, except to free her by the pumps, or to abandon her by the boats as soon as possible.\n\n**WATER-Sail**, a small sail spread occasionally under the lower studding-sail, or driver-boom, in a fair wind and smooth sea.\n\n**WATER-Ouzel.** See *Turdus*, Ornithology Index.\n\n**WATER-Spout**, an extraordinary meteor, consisting of a large mass of water collected into a sort of column, and moved with rapidity along the surface of the sea.\n\nThe best account of the water-spout which we have met with is in the Phil. Trans. Abridged, vol. viii., as observed by Mr Joseph Harris, May 21, 1732, about unfixed, lat. 32\u00b0 30' N.; long. 9\u00b0 E. from Cape Florida.\n\n\"When first we saw the spout (says he), it was whole and entire, and much of the shape and proportion of a speaking trumpet; the small end being downwards, and reaching to the sea, and the big end terminated in a black thick cloud. The spout itself was very black, and the more so the higher up. It seemed to be exactly perpendicular to the horizon, and its sides perfectly smooth, without the least ruggedness. Where it fell the spray of the sea rose to a considerable height, which made somewhat the appearance of a great smoke. From the first time we saw it, it continued whole about a minute, and till it was quite dissipated about three minutes. It began to wane from below, and so gradually up, while the upper part remained entire, without any visible alteration, till at last it ended in the black cloud above; upon which there seemed to fall a very heavy rain in that neighbourhood.\u2014There was but little wind, and the sky elsewhere was pretty serene.\"\n\nWater-spouts have by some been supposed to be merely electrical in their origin; particularly by Signor Beccaria, who supported his opinion by some experiments. But if we attend to the successive phenomena necessary to constitute a complete water-spout through their various stages, we shall be convinced, that recourse must be had to some other principle in order to obtain a complete solution.\n\nDr Franklin, in his Physical and Meteorological Observations, supposes a water-spout and a whirlwind to proceed from the same cause; their only difference being, that the latter passes over the land, and the former over the water. This opinion is corroborated by M. de la Pryme, in the Philosophical Transactions, where he describes two spouts observed at different times in Yorkshire, whose appearances in the air were exactly like those of the spouts at sea, and their effects the same as those of real whirlwinds.\n\nA fluid moving from all points horizontally towards a centre, must at that centre either mount or descend. If a hole be opened in the middle of the bottom of a tub filled with water, the water will flow from all sides to the centre, and there descend in a whirl; but air flowing on or near the surface of land or water, from all sides towards a centre, must at that centre ascend; because the land or water will hinder its descent.\n\nThe doctor, in proceeding to explain his conceptions, begs to be allowed two or three positions, as a foundation for his hypothesis. 1. That the lower region of air is often more heated, and so more rarefied, than the upper, and by consequence specifically lighter. The coldness of the upper region is manifested by the hail, which falls from it in warm weather. 2. That heated air may be very moist, and yet the moisture so equally diffused and rarefied as not to be visible till colder air mixes with it; at which time it condenses and becomes visible. Thus our breath, although invisible in summer, becomes visible in winter.\n\nThese circumstances being granted, he supposes a tract of land or sea, of about 60 miles in extent, unsheltered by clouds and unrefreshed by the wind, during a summer's day, or perhaps for several days without intermission, till it becomes violently heated, together with the lower region of the air in contact with it; so that the latter becomes specifically lighter than the superincumbent higher region of the atmosphere, wherein the clouds are usually floated: he supposes also that the air surrounding this tract has not been so much heated during those days, and therefore remains heavier. The consequence of this, he conceives, should be, that the heated lighter air should ascend, and the heavier descend; and as this rising cannot operate throughout the whole tract at once, because that would leave too extensive a vacuum, the rising will begin precisely in that column which happens to be lightest or most rarefied; and the warm air will flow horizontally from all parts of this column, where the several currents meeting, and joining to rise, a whirl is naturally formed, in the same manner as a whirl is formed in a tub of water, by the descending fluid receding from all sides of the tub towards the hole in the centre.\n\nAnd as the several currents arrive at this central rising column with a considerable degree of horizontal motion, they cannot suddenly change it to a vertical motion: therefore as they gradually, in approaching the whirl, decline from right to curve or circular lines, so, having joined the whirl, they ascend by a spiral motion; in the same manner as the water descends spirally through the hole in the tub before mentioned.\n\nLastly, as the lower air nearest the surface is more rarefied by the heat of the sun, it is more impelled by the current of the surrounding cold and heavy air which is to affume its place, and consequently its motion towards the whirl is swiftest, and so the force of the lower part of the whirl strongest, and the centrifugal force of its particles greatest. Hence the vacuum which incloses the axis of the whirl should be greatest near the earth or sea, and diminish gradually as it approaches the region of the clouds, till it ends in a point.\n\nThis circle is of various diameters, sometimes very large.\n\nIf the vacuum passes over water, the water may rise in a body or column therein to the height of about 32 feet. This whirl of air may be as invisible as the air itself, though reaching in reality from the water to the region of cool air, in which our low summer thunderclouds commonly float; but it will soon become visible at its extremities. The agitation of the water under the whirling of the circle, and the swelling and rising of the water in the commencement of the vacuum, renders it visible below. It is perceived above by the\nwarm air being brought up to the cooler region, where its moisture begins to be condensed by the cold into thick vapour, and is then first discovered at the highest part, which being now cooled condenses what rises behind it, and this latter acts in the same manner on the succeeding body; where, by the contact of the vapours, the cold operates faster in a right line downwards, than the vapours themselves can climb in a spiral line upwards: they climb however; and as by continual addition they grow denser, and by consequence increase their centrifugal force, and being riled above the concentrating currents that compose the whirl, they fly off, and form a cloud.\n\nIt seems easy to conceive, how, by this successive condensation from above, the spout appears to drop or descend from the cloud, although the materials of which it is composed are all the while ascending. The condensation of the moisture contained in so great a quantity of warm air as may be supposed to rise in a short time in this prodigiously rapid whirl, is perhaps sufficient to form a great extent of cloud; and the friction of the whirling air on the sides of the column may detach great quantities of its water, disperse them into drops, and carry them up in the spiral whirl mixed with the air. The heavier drops may indeed fly off, and fall into a shower about the spout; but much of it will be broken into vapour, and yet remain visible.\n\nAs the whirl weakens, the tube may apparently separate in the middle; the column of water subsiding, the superior condensed part drawing up to the cloud. The tube or whirl of air may nevertheless remain entire, the middle only becoming invisible, as not containing any visible matter.\n\nDr Linday, however, in several letters published in the Gentleman's Magazine, has controverted this theory of Dr Franklin, and endeavoured to prove, that water-spouts and whirlwinds are distinct phenomena; and that the water which forms the water-spout, does not ascend from the sea, as Dr Franklin supposes, but descends from the atmosphere. Our limits do not permit us to insert his arguments here, but they may be seen in the Gentleman's Magazine, volume li. p. 559, 615; vol. iii. p. 1025; and vol. iv. p. 594. We cannot avoid observing, however, that he treats Dr Franklin with a degree of asperity to which he is by no means entitled, and that his arguments, even if conclusive, prove nothing more than that some water-spouts certainly descend; which Dr Franklin hardly ever ventured to deny. There are some very valuable dissertations on this subject by Professor Willeke of Upsal.\n\n**Water-Works.** Under this name may be comprehended almost every hydraulic structure or contrivance; such as, canals, conduits, locks, mills, water engines, &c. But they may be conveniently arranged under two general heads, 1st, Works which have for their object the conducting, raising, or otherwise managing, of water; and, 2dly, Works which derive their efficacy from the impulse or other action of water. The first class comprehends the methods of simply conducting water in aqueducts or in pipes for the supply of domestic consumption or the working of machinery: It comprehends also the methods of procuring the supplies necessary for these purposes, by means of pumps, water, or fire engines. It also comprehends the frequent management of the water thus conducted, whether in order to make the proper distribution of it according to the demand, or to employ it for the purpose of navigation, by lockage, or other contrivances.\n\nAnd in the prosecution of these things many subordinate problems will occur, in which practice will derive great advantages from a scientific acquaintance with the subject. The second class of water-works is of much greater variety, comprehending almost every kind of hydraulic machine; and would of itself fill volumes. Many of these have already occurred in various articles of this Dictionary. In describing or treating them, we have tacitly referred the discussion of their general principles, in which they all resemble each other, to some article where they could be taken in a connected body, susceptible of general scientific discussion, independent of the circumstances which of necessity introduced the particular modifications required by the uses to which the structures were to be applied. That part of the present article, therefore, which embraces these common principles, will chiefly relate to the theory of water mills, or rather of water wheels; because, when the necessary motion is given to the axis of the water wheel, this may be set to the performance of any task whatever.\n\n**CLASS I.**\n\n1. Of the conducting of Water.\n\nThis is undoubtedly a business of great importance, and makes a principal part of the practice of the civil engineer: It is also a business so imperfectly understood, that we believe that very few engineers can venture to lay, with tolerable precision, what will be the quantity of water which his work will convey, or what plan and dimensions of conduit will convey the quantity which may be proposed. For proof of this we shall only refer our readers to the facts mentioned in the article Rivers, No 27, &c.\n\nIn that article we have given a sort of history of the progress of our knowledge in hydraulics, a branch of mechanical philosophy which seems to have been entirely unknown to the ancients. Even Archimedes, the author of almost all that we know in hydrostatics, seems to have been entirely ignorant of any principles by which he could determine the motion of water. The mechanical science of the ancients seems to have reached no farther than the doctrine of equilibrium among bodies at rest. Guglielmini first ventured to consider the motion of water in open canals and in rivers. Its motion in pipes had been partially considered in detached scraps by others, but not so as to make a body of doctrine. Sir Isaac Newton first endeavoured to render hydraulics susceptible of mathematical demonstration: But his fundamental proposition has not yet been freed from very serious objections; nor have the attempts of his successors, such as the Bernoullis, Euler, D'Alembert, and others, been much more successful: so that hydraulics may still be considered as very imperfect, and the general conclusions which we are accustomed to receive as fundamental propositions are not much better than matters of observation, little supported by principle, and therefore requiring the most formidable\nious caution in the application of them to any hitherto untried case. When experiments are multiplied so as to include as great a variety of cases as possible; and when these are cleared of extraneous circumstances, and properly arranged, we must receive the conclusions drawn from them as the general laws of hydraulics. The experiments of the abb\u00e9 Boffut, narrated in his *Hydrodynamique*, are of the greatest value, having been made in the cases of most general frequency, and being made with great care. The greatest service, however, has been done by the chevalier Buat, who saw the folly of attempting to deduce an accurate theory from any principles that we have as yet learned, and the necessity of adhering to such a theory as could be deduced from experiment alone, independent of any more general principles. Such a theory must be a just one, if the experiments are really general, unaffected by the particular circumstances of the case, and if the classes of experiment are sufficiently comprehensive to include all the cases which occur in the most important practical questions. Some principle was necessary, however, for connecting these experiments. The sufficiency of this principle was not easily ascertained. M. Buat's way of establishing this was judicious. If the principle is ill-founded, the results of its combination in cases of actual experiments must be irregular; but if experiments, seemingly very unlike, and in a vast variety of dissimilar cases, give a train of results which is extremely regular and consistent, we may presume that the principle, which in this manner harmonizes and reconciles things so unlike, is founded in the nature of things; and if this principle be such as is agreeable to our clearest notions of the internal mechanism of the motions of fluids, our preconception approaches to conviction.\n\nProceeding in this way, the chevalier Buat has collected a prodigious number of facts, comprehending almost every case of the motion of fluids. He first classified them according to their resemblance in some one particular, and observed the differences which accompanied their differences in other circumstances; and by considering what could produce these differences, he obtained general rules, deduced from fact, by which these differences could be made to fall into a regular series. He then arranged all the experiments under some other circumstances of resemblance, and pursued the same method; and by following this out, he has produced a general proposition, which applies to the whole of this numerous list of experiments with a precision far exceeding our utmost hopes. This proposition is contained in No. 59. of the article RIVERS, and is there offered as one of the most valuable results of modern science.\n\nWe must, however, observe, that of this list of experiments there is a very large class, which is not direct, but requires a good deal of reflection to enable us to draw a confident conclusion; and this is in cases which are very frequent and important, viz., where the declivity is exceedingly small, as in open canals and rivers. The experiments were of the following forms: Two large cisterns were made to communicate with each other by means of a pipe. The surfaces of the water in these cisterns were made to differ only by a small fraction of an inch; and it is supposed that the motion in the communicating pipe will be the same as in a very long pipe, or an open canal, having this very minute declivity. We have no difficulty in admitting the conclusion; but we have seen it contested, and it is by no means intuitive. We had entertained hopes that this important case would have been determined by direct experiments, which the writer of this article was commissioned to make by the Board for Encouraging Improvements and Manufactures in Scotland: But the infirm state of his health was always an effectual bar to the accomplishment of this desirable object. This, however, need not occasion any hesitation in the adoption of M. Buat's general proposition, because the experiments which we are now criticizing fall in precisely with the general train of the rest, and show no general deviation which would indicate a fallacy in principle.\n\nWe apprehend it to be quite unnecessary to add much to what has been already delivered on the motion of waters in an open canal. Their general progressive motion, and consequently the quantity delivered by an aqueduct of any slope and dimension, are sufficiently determined; and all that is wanted is the tables which we promised in No. 65. of the article RIVERS, by which any person who understands common arithmetic may, in five minutes time or less, compute the quantity of water which will be delivered by the aqueduct, canal, conduit, or pipe; for the theorem in No. 59. of this article applies to them all without distinction. We therefore take this opportunity of inserting these tables, which have been computed on purpose for this work with great labour.\nTable I.

This is let down for every tenth of an inch in the first 10 inches, that the answers may be more accurately obtained for pipes, the mean depth of which seldom exceeds three or four inches. The column is continued to 100 inches, which is fully equal to the hydraulic mean depth of any canal.\n\nColumn 2. contains the logarithms of the values of \\(\\sqrt{d} - 0.1\\), multiplied by 307; that is, the logarithm of the numerator of the fraction \\(\\frac{307(\\sqrt{d} - 0.1)}{\\sqrt{s} - 1}\\) in No 65, of the article Rivers.\n\nColumn 3. contains the product of the values of \\(\\sqrt{d} - 0.1\\) multiplied by 0.3.\n\nTable II. consists of two columns.\u2014Column 1. entitled \\(s\\), contains the denominator of the fraction expressing the slope or declivity of any pipe or canal; that is, the quotient of its length divided by the elevation of one extremity above the other. Thus, if a canal of one mile in length be three feet higher at one end than the other, then \\(s = \\frac{5280}{3} = 1760\\).\n\nColumn 2. contains the logarithms of the denominators of the above mentioned fraction, or of the different values of the quantity \\(\\sqrt{s} - 1\\).\n\nThese quantities were computed true to the third decimal place. Notwithstanding this, the last figure in about a dozen of the first logarithms of each table is not absolutely certain to the nearest unit. But this cannot produce an error of 1 in 100,000.\n\nExamples of the Use of these Tables.\n\nExample 1. Water is brought into the city of Edinburgh in several mains. One of these is a pipe of five inches diameter. The length of the pipe is 14,637 feet; and the reservoir at Comilton is 44 feet higher than the reservoir into which it delivers the water on the Castle Hill. Query, The number of Scotch pints which this pipe should deliver in a minute?\n\n1. We have \\(d = \\frac{5}{4} = 1.25\\) inches. The logarithm corresponding to this \\(d\\), being nearly the mean between the logarithms corresponding to 1.2 and 1.3 is 2.49472.\n\n2. We have \\(s = \\frac{14637}{44} = 332.7\\). The logarithm corresponding to this in Table II. is had by taking proportional parts for the difference between the logarithms for \\(s = 330\\) and \\(s = 340\\), and is 1.18533.\n\n3. From 2.49472\n   Take 1.18533\n\nRemains 1.30939, the logarithm of 20.385 inches.\n\n4. In column 3. of Table I. opposite to \\(d = 1.2\\) and \\(s = 1.3\\) are 0.3 and 0.31, of which the mean is 0.305 inches, the correction for viscosity.\n\n5. Therefore the velocity in inches per second is 20.385 - 0.305 = 20.08.\n\n6. To obtain the Scotch pints per minute (each containing 103.4 cubic inches), multiply the velocity by 60, and this product by 5\u00b2, and this by 0.7854 (the area of a circle whose diameter is 1), and divide by 103.4. Or, by logarithms,\n\nAdd the log. of 20.08 - 1.30276\nlog. of 6\u00b2 - 1.77815\nlog. of 5\u00b2 or 25 - 1.39794\nlog. of 0.7854 - 9.89509\n\nSubtract the log. of 103.4 - 4.37394\nRemains the log. of 228.8 pints - 2.35943\n\nExample 2. The canal mentioned in the article Rivers, No 63, was 18 feet broad at the surface, and 7 feet at the bottom. It was 4 feet deep, and had a declivity of 4 inches in a mile. Query, The mean velocity?\n\n1. The slant side of the canal, corresponding to 4 feet deep and 5\u00bd projection, is 6.8 feet; therefore the border touched by the water is 6.8 + 7 + 6.8 = 20.6. The area is \\(4 \\times \\frac{18+7}{2} = 50\\) square feet. Therefore \\(d = \\frac{50}{20.6} = 2.427\\) feet, or 29.124 inches. The logarithm corresponding to this in Table I. is 3.21113, and the correction for viscosity from the third column of the same Table is 1.58.\n\n2. The slope is one-third of a foot in a mile, or one foot in three miles. Therefore \\(s = 15.840\\). The logarithm corresponding to this is 2.08285.\n\n3. From 3.21113\n   Subtract 2.08285\n\nRemains 1.12833 = log. of 13.438 inches.\nSubtract for viscosity 1.58\n\nVelocity per second - 11.858\n\nThis velocity is considerably smaller than what was observed by Mr Watt. And indeed we observe, that in the very small declivities of rivers and canals, the formula is a little different. We have made several comparisons with a formula which is essentially the same with Buat's, and comes nearest in these cases. Instead of taking the hyperbolic logarithm of \\(\\sqrt{s} + 1.6\\), multiply its common logarithm by 24, or multiply it by 9, and divide the product by 4; and this process is vastly easier than taking the hyperbolic logarithm.\n\nWe have not, however, presumed to calculate tables on the authority of our own observations, thinking too respectfully of this gentleman's labours and observations. But this subject will, ere long, be fully established on a series of observations on canals of various dimensions and declivities, made by several eminent engineers during the execution of them. Fortunately Mr Buat's formula is chiefly founded on observations on small canals; and is therefore most accurate in such works where it is most necessary, viz. in mill courses, and other derivations for working machinery.\n\nWe now proceed to take notice of a few circumstances which deserve attention, in the construction of canals, in addition to those delivered in the article Rivers.\n\nWhen a canal or aqueduct is brought off from a basin\nor larger stream, it ought always to be widened at the entry, if it is intended for drawing off a continued stream of water: For such a canal has a slope, without which it can have no current. Suppose it filled to a dead level to the farther end: Take away the bar, and the water immediately begins to flow off at that end. But it is some time before any motion is perceived at the head of the canal, during all which time the motion of the water is augmenting in every part of the canal; consequently the slope is increasing in every part, this being the sole cause of its stream. When the water at the entry begins to move, the slope is scarcely sensible there; but it sensibly steepens every moment with the increase of velocity, which at last attains its maximum relative to the slope and dimensions of the whole canal; and this regulates the depth of water in every point down the stream. When all has attained a state of permanency, the slope at the entry remains much greater than in any other part of the canal; for this slope must be such as will produce a velocity sufficient for supplying its train.\n\nAnd it must be remembered, that the velocity which must be produced greatly exceeds the mean velocity corresponding to the train of the canal. Suppose that this is 25 inches. There must be a velocity of 30 inches at the surface, as appears by the Table in the article Rivers, No. 80. This must be produced by a real fall at the entry.\n\nIn every other part the slope is sufficient, if it merely serves to give the water (already in motion) force enough for overcoming the friction and other resistances. But at the entry the water is stagnant, if in a basin, or it is moving past laterally, if the aqueduct is derived from a river; and, having no velocity whatever in the direction of the canal, it must derive it from its slope. The water therefore which has acquired a permanent form in such an aqueduct, must necessarily take that form which exactly performs the offices requisite in its different portions. The surface remains horizontal in the basin, as to KC (fig. 1.), till it comes near the entry of the canal AB, and there it acquires the form of an undulated curve CDE; and then the surface acquires an uniform slope EF, in the lower part of the canal, where the water is in train.\n\nIf this is a drain, the discharge is much less than might be produced by the same bed if this sudden slope could be avoided. If it is to be navigated, having only a very gentle slope in its whole length, this sudden slope is a very great imperfection, both by diminishing the depth of water, which might otherwise be obtained along the canal, and by rendering the passage of boats into the basin very difficult, and the coming out very hazardous.\n\nAll this may be avoided, and the velocity at the entry may be kept equal to that which forms the train of the canal, by the simple process of enlarging the entry. Suppose that the water could accelerate along the slopes of the canal, as a heavy body would do on a finely polished plane. If we now make the width of the entry in its different parts inversely proportional to the fictitious velocities in those parts, it is plain that the slope of the surface will be made parallel to that of the canal which is in train. This will require a form somewhat like a bell or speaking trumpet, as may easily be shown by a mathematical discussion. It would, however, be so much enlarged at the basin as to occupy much room, and it would be very expensive to make such an excavation. But we may, at a very moderate expense of money and room, make the increase of velocity at the entry almost insensible. This should always be done, and it is not all expense: for if it be not done, the water will undermine the banks on each side, because it is moving very swiftly, and will make an excavation for itself, leaving all the mud in the canal below. We may observe this enlargement at the entry of all natural derivations from a basin or lake. It is a very instructive experiment, to fill up this enlargement, continuing the parallel sides of the drain quite to the side of the lake. We shall immediately observe the water grow shallower in the drain, and its performance will diminish. Supposing the ditch carried on with parallel sides quite to the side of the basin, if we build two walls or dykes from the extremities of those sides, bending outwards with a proper curvature (and this will often be less costly than widening the drain), the discharge will be greatly increased. We have seen instances where it was nearly doubled.\n\nThe enlargement at the mouths of rivers is generally owing to the same cause. The tide of flood up the river produces a superficial slope opposite to that of the river, and this widens the mouth. This is most remarkable when the tides are high, and the river has little slope.\n\nAfter this great fall at the entry of the canal, in which all the filaments are much accelerated, and the inferior ones most of all, things take a contrary turn. The water, by rubbing on the bottom and the sides, is retarded; and therefore the section must, from being shallow, become a little deeper, and the surface will be convex for some distance till all comes into train. When this is established, the filaments nearest the bottom and side are moving slowest, and the surface (in the middle especially) retains the greatest velocity, gliding over the rest. The velocity in the canal, and the depth of the section, adjust themselves in such a manner that the difference between the surface of the basin and the surface of the uniform section of the canal corresponds exactly to the velocity. Thus, if this be observed to be two feet in a second, the difference of height will be \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)ths of an inch.\n\nAll the practical questions that are of considerable importance respecting the motion of water in aqueducts, may be easily, though not elegantly, solved by means of the tables.\n\nBut it is to be remembered, that these tables relate only to uniform motion, that is, to water that is in train, and where the velocity suffers no change by lengthening the conduit, provided the slope remain the same. It is much more difficult to determine what will be the velocity, &c., in a canal of which nothing is given but the form, and slope, and depth of the entry, without saying how deep the water runs in it. And it is here that the common doctrines of hydraulics are most in fault, and unable to teach us how deep the water will run in a canal, though the depth of the basin at the entry be perfectly known. Between the part of the canal which is in train and the basin, there is an interval where the water is in a state of acceleration, and is afterwards retarded.\n\nThe determination of the motions in this interval is exceedingly\nexceedingly difficult, even in a rectangular canal. It was one great aim of M. Busat's experiments to ascertain this by measuring accurately the depth of the water. But he found that when the slope was but a very few inches in the whole length of his canal, it was not in train for want of greater length; and when the slope was still less, the small fractions of an inch, by which he was to judge of the variations of depth, could not be measured with sufficient accuracy. It would be a most desirable point to determine the length of a canal, whose slope and other dimensions are given, which will bring it into train; and what is the ratio which will then obtain between the depth at the entry and the depth which will be maintained. Till this be done, the engineer cannot ascertain by a direct process what quantity of water will be drawn off from a reservoir by a given canal. But as yet this is out of our reach. Experiments, however, are in view which will promote the investigation.\n\nBut this and similar questions are of such importance, that we cannot be said to have improved hydraulics, unless we can give a tolerably precise answer. This we can do by a sort of retrograde process, proceeding on the principles of uniform motion established by the Chevalier Busat. We may suppose a train maintained in the canal, and then examine whether this train can be produced by any fall that is possible at the entry. If it can, we may be certain that it is so produced, and our problem is solved.\n\nWe shall now point out the methods of answering some chief questions of this kind.\n\n**Quest. 1.** Given the slope \\( s \\) and the breadth \\( w \\) of a canal, and the height \\( H \\) of the surface of the water in the basin above the bottom of the entry; to find the depth \\( h \\) and velocity \\( V \\) of the stream, and the quantity of water \\( Q \\) which is discharged?\n\nThe chief difficulty is to find the depth of the stream where it is in train. For this end, we may simplify the hydraulic theorem of uniform motion in No. 59. of the article RIVER; making \\( V = \\frac{\\sqrt{N_g d}}{\\sqrt{S}} \\), where \\( g \\) is the velocity (in inches) acquired in a second by falling, \\( d \\) is the hydraulic mean depth, and \\( \\sqrt{S} \\) stands for \\( \\sqrt{S - L} \\). \\( N_g \\) is a number to be fixed by experiment (see RIVER, No. 53.) depending on the contraction or obstruction sustained at the entry of the canal, and it may in most common cases be taken \\( = 244 \\); so that \\( \\sqrt{N_g} \\) may be somewhat less than 307. To find it, we may begin by taking for our depth of stream a quantity \\( h \\), somewhat smaller than \\( H \\) the height of the surface of the basin above the bottom of the canal. With this depth, and the known width \\( w \\) of the canal, we can find the hydraulic depth \\( d \\) (See RIVERS, No. 48). Then with \\( \\sqrt{d} \\) and the slope find \\( V \\) by the Table: make this \\( V = \\frac{\\sqrt{N_g d}}{\\sqrt{S}} \\). This gives \\( \\frac{V}{\\sqrt{S}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{w h}}{\\sqrt{w + 2 h}} \\).\n\nThis value of \\( N_g \\) is sufficiently exact; for a small error of depth hardly affects the hydraulic mean depth.\n\nAfter this preparation, the expression of the mean velocity in the canal will be \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{N_g}}{\\sqrt{S}} \\). The height which will produce this velocity is \\( \\frac{N_g}{2 GS} \\left( \\frac{w h}{w + 2 h} \\right) \\).\n\nNow this is the slope at the entry of the canal which produces the velocity that is afterwards maintained against the obstructions by the slope of the canal. It is therefore \\( H - h \\). Hence we deduce\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{(w \\left( \\frac{N_g}{2 GS} + 1 \\right) - 2H)}{4}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n+ \\frac{\\sqrt{8 H w + \\left( w \\left( \\frac{N_g}{2 GS} + 1 \\right) - 2H \\right)^2}}{4}\n\\]\n\nIf there be no contraction at the entry, \\( g = G \\) and \\( \\frac{g}{2 G} = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nHaving thus obtained the depth \\( h \\) of the stream, we obtain the quantity of water by combining this with the width \\( w \\) and the velocity \\( V \\).\n\nBut as this was but an approximation, it is necessary to examine whether the velocity \\( V \\) be possible. This is very easy. It must be produced by the fall \\( H - h \\). We shall have no occasion for any correction of our first assumption, if \\( h \\) has not been extravagantly erroneous, because a small mistake in \\( h \\) produces almost the same variation in \\( d \\). The test of accuracy, however, is, that \\( h \\), together with the height which will produce the velocity \\( V \\), must make up the whole height \\( H \\). Assuming \\( h \\) too small, leaves \\( H - h \\) too great, and will give a small velocity \\( V \\), which requires a small value of \\( H - h \\). The error of \\( H - h \\) therefore is always greater than the error we have committed in our first assumption. Therefore when this error of \\( H - h \\) is but a trifle, such as one-fourth of an inch, we may rest satisfied with our answer.\n\nPerhaps the easiest process may be the following: Suppose the whole stream in train to have the depth \\( H \\). The velocity \\( V \\) obtained for this depth and slope by the Table requires a certain productive height \\( u \\). Make \\( \\sqrt{H + u} : H = H : h \\), and \\( h \\) will be exceedingly near the truth. The reason is obvious.\n\n**Quest. 2.** Given the discharge (or quantity to be furnished in a second) \\( Q \\), the height \\( H \\) of the basin above the bottom of the canal, and the slope; to find the dimensions of the canal?\n\nLet \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) be the depth and mean width. It is plain that the equation \\( \\frac{Q}{xy} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2 G}}{\\sqrt{H - x}} \\) will give a value of \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\). Compare this with the value of \\( y \\) obtained from the equation \\( \\frac{Q}{xy} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N_g}}{\\sqrt{S}} \\).\n\nThis will give an equation containing only \\( x \\) and known quantities. But it will be very complicated, and we must have recourse to an approximation. This will be best understood in the form of an example.\n\nSuppose the depth at the entry to be 18 inches, and the slope \\( \\frac{1}{100} \\). Let 1200 cubic feet of water per minute be the quantity of water to be drawn off, for working machinery or any other purpose; and let the canal be...\nbe supposed of the best form, recommended in No. 69. of the article RIVER, where the base of the sloping side is four-thirds of the height.\n\nThe slightest consideration will show us that if \\( V^2 \\) be taken for the height producing the velocity, it cannot exceed 3 inches, nor be less than 1. Suppose it = 2, and therefore the depth of the stream in the canal to be 16 inches; find the mean width of the canal by the equation\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{Q}{h(\\sqrt{d} - 0.1)(\\sqrt{\\frac{327}{S}} - 0.3)}\n\\]\n\nin which \\( Q \\) is 20 cubic feet (the 60th part of 1200), \\( \\sqrt{S} \\) is 28.153, \\( \\frac{1}{1000} - L_a \\frac{1}{1000} + 1.6 \\), and \\( h = 16 \\). This gives \\( w = 5.52 \\) feet. The section \\( n = 7.36 \\) feet, and \\( V = 32.6 \\) inches. This requires a fall of 1.52 inches instead of 2 inches. Take this from 18, and there remains 16.48, which we shall find not to differ one-tenth of an inch from the exact depth which the water will acquire and maintain. We may therefore be satisfied with assuming 5.36 feet as the mean width, and 3.53 feet for the width at the bottom.\n\nThis approximation proceeds on this consideration, that when the width diminishes by a small quantity, and in the same proportion that the depth increases, the hydraulic mean depth remains the same, and therefore the velocity also remains, and the quantity discharged changes in the exact proportion of the section. Any minute error which may result from this supposition, may be corrected by increasing the fall producing the velocity, in the proportion of the first hydraulic mean depth to the mean depth corresponding to the new dimensions found for the canal. It will now become 1.53, and \\( V \\) will be 32.72, and the depth will be 16.47. The quantity discharged being divided by \\( V \\), will give the section \\( = 7.335 \\) feet, from which, and the new depth, we obtain 5.344 for the width.\n\nThis and the foregoing are the most common questions proposed to an engineer. We assert with some confidence that few of the profession are able to answer them with tolerable precision. We cannot offend the professional gentlemen by this, when we inform them that the Academy of Sciences at Paris were occupied during several months with an examination of a plan proposed by M. Parcieux, for bringing the waters of the Yvette into Paris; and after the most mature consideration, gave in a report of the quantity of water which M. De Parcieux's aqueduct would yield, and that their report has been found erroneous in the proportion of at least 2 to 5: For the waters have been brought in, and exceed the report in this proportion. Indeed long after the giving in the report, M. Perronet, the most celebrated engineer in France, affirmed that the dimensions proposed were much greater than were necessary, and said that an aqueduct of 5 feet wide, and 3\u00bd deep with a slope of 15 inches in a thousand fathoms, would have a velocity of 12 or 13 inches per second, which would bring in all the water furnished by the proposed sources. The great diminution of expense occasioned by the alteration encouraged the community to undertake the work. It was accordingly begun, and a part executed. The water was found to run with a velocity of near 19 inches when it was 3\u00bd feet deep. M. Perronet founded his computation on his own experience alone, acknowledging that he had no theory to instruct him. The work was carried no farther, it being found that the city could be supplied at a much smaller expense by steam engines erected by Boulton and Watt. But the facts which occurred in the partial execution of the aqueduct are very valuable. If M. Perronet's aqueduct be examined by our general formula, \\( s \\) will be found \\( = \\frac{1}{3880} \\), and \\( d = 18.72 \\), from which we deduce the velocity \\( = 18 \\), agreeing with the observation with astonishing precision.\n\nThe experiments at Turin by Michaelotti on canals were very numerous, but complicated with many circumstances which would render the discussion too long for this place. When cleared of these circumstances, which we have done with scrupulous care, they are also abundantly conformable to our theory of the uniform motion of running waters. But to return to our subject:\n\nShould it be required to bring off at once from the basin a mill course, having a determined velocity for driving an undershot wheel, the problem becomes easier, because the velocity and slope combined determine the hydraulic mean depth at once; and the depth of the stream will be had by means of the height which must be taken for the whole depth at the entry, in order to produce the required velocity.\n\nIn like manner, having given the quantity to be discharged, and the velocity and the depth at the entry, we can find the other dimensions of the channel; and the mean depth being found, we can determine the slope.\n\nWhen the slope of a canal is very small, so that the depth of the uniform stream differs but a little from that at the entry, the quantity discharged is but small. But a great velocity, requiring a great fall at the entry, produces a great diminution of depth, and therefore it may not compensate for this diminution, and the quantity discharged may be smaller. Improbable as this may appear, it is not demonstrably false; and hence we may see the propriety of the following\n\n**Question 3.** Given the depth \\( H \\) at the entry of a rectangular canal, and also its width \\( w \\); required the slope, depth, and velocity which will produce the greatest possible discharge?\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the unknown depth of the stream. \\( H - x \\) is the productive fall, and the velocity is \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{2G}{H-x}} \\). This multiplied by \\( w \\times x \\) will give the quantity discharged. Therefore \\( w \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{2G}{H-x}} \\times x \\) must be made a maximum. The common process for this will give the equation, \\( 2H = 3x \\), or \\( x = \\frac{2}{3}H \\). The mean velocity will be \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{2G}{H}} \\), the section will be \\( \\frac{2}{3}wH \\), and the discharge \\( = \\frac{2}{3} \\sqrt{\\frac{2G}{H}} wH \\).\n\n\\( d = \\frac{2}{3}wH \\). With these data the slope is easily had by the formula for uniform motion.\n\nIf the canal is of the trapezoidal form, the investigation is more troublesome, and requires the resolution of a cubic equation.\n\nIt may appear strange that increasing the slope of a canal beyond the quantity determined by this problem can diminish the quantity of water conveyed. But one of these two things must happen; either the motion will not acquire uniformity in such a canal for want of length,\nlength, or the discharge must diminish. Supposing, however, that it could augment, we can judge how far this can go. Let us take the extreme case by making the canal vertical. In this case it becomes a simple weir or wasteboard. Now the discharge of a wasteboard is $\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{2G} w (\\frac{H}{h} - \\frac{1}{2} h)^{\\frac{3}{2}}$. The maximum determined by the preceding problem is to that of the wasteboard of the same dimensions as $H \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4} H : H^{\\frac{1}{2}} - (\\frac{1}{2} H)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}$, or as $H \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4} H : H \\sqrt{H - \\frac{1}{2} H} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} H} = 5773 : 6465$, nearly $9 : 10$.\n\nHaving given the dimensions and slope of a canal, we can discover the relation between its expenditure and the time; or we can tell how much it will sink the surface of a pond in 24 hours, and the gradual progress of this effect; and this might be made the subject of a particular problem. But it is complicated and difficult. In cases where this is an interesting object, we may solve the question with sufficient accuracy, by calculating the expenditure at the beginning, supposing the basin kept full. Then from the known area of the pond, we can tell in what time this expenditure will sink an inch; do the same on the supposition that the water is one-third lower, and that it is two-thirds lower (noticing the contraction of the surface of the pond occasioned by this abstraction of its waters). Thus we shall obtain three rates of diminution, from which we can easily deduce the desired relation between the expenditure and the time.\n\nAqueducts derived from a basin or river are commonly furnished with a sluice at the entry. This changes exceedingly the state of things. The slope of the canal may be precisely such as will maintain the mean velocity of the water which passes under the sluice: in which case the depth of the stream is equal to that of the sluice, and the velocity is produced at once by the head of water above it. But if the slope is less than this, the velocity of the inflowing water is diminished, and the water must rise in the canal. This must check the efflux at the sluice, and the water will be as it were stagnant above what comes through below it. It is extremely difficult to determine at what precise slope the water will begin to check the efflux. The contraction at the lower edge of the board hinders the water from attaining at once the whole depth which it acquires afterwards, when its velocity diminishes by the obstructions. While the regorging which these obstructions occasion does not reach back to the sluice, the efflux is not affected by it.\u2014Even when it does reach to the sluice, there will be a less depth immediately behind it than farther down the canal, where it is in train; because the swift moving water which is next the bottom drags with it the regorged water which lies on it; but the canal must be rapid to make this difference of depth sensible. In ordinary canals, with moderate slopes and velocities, the velocity at the sluice may be safely taken as if it were that which corresponds to the difference of depths above and below the sluice, where both were in train.\n\nLet therefore $H$ be the depth above the sluice, and $h$ the depth in the canal. Let $e$ be the elevation of the sluice above the sole, and let $b$ be its breadth. The discharge will be $eb \\sqrt{H-h} \\sqrt{2G}$ for the sluice, and $wh \\sqrt{\\frac{N_g}{s}} \\sqrt{\\frac{wh}{w+2h}}$ for the canal. These must be the same. This gives the equation $eb \\sqrt{H-h} \\sqrt{2G} = wh \\sqrt{\\frac{N_g}{s}} \\sqrt{\\frac{wh}{w+2h}}$ containing the solution of all the questions which can be proposed. The only uncertainty is in the quantity $G$, which expresses the velocity competent to the passage of the water through the orifice, circumstanced as it is, namely, subjected to contraction. This may be regulated by a proper form given to the entry into this orifice. The contraction may be almost annihilated by making the masonry of a cycloidal form on both sides, and also at the lower edge of the sluice-board, so as to give the orifice a form resembling fig. D, in the article RIVERS. If the sluice is thin in the face of a basin, the contraction will reduce $2G$ to $2G_1$. If the sluice be as wide as the canal, $2G$ will be nearly $500$.\n\nQuestion 4. Given the head of water in the basin $H$, the breadth $b$, and elevation $e$ of the sluice, and the breadth $w$ and slope $s$ of the canal, to find the depth $h$ of the stream, the velocity, and the discharge?\n\nWe must (as in Question 2) make a first supposition for $h$, in order to find the proper value of $d$. Then the equation $eb \\sqrt{H-h} \\sqrt{2G} = wh \\sqrt{\\frac{N_g}{s}}$ gives $h = \\frac{G e^2 b^2 s}{w^2 N_g d} + \\frac{G e^2 b^2 s H}{w^2 N_g d} + \\frac{(G e^2 b^2 s)^2}{w^2 N_g d}$. If this value shall differ considerably from the one which we assumed in order to begin the computation, make use of it for obtaining a new value of $d$, and repeat the operation. We shall rarely be obliged to perform a third operation.\n\nThe following is of frequent use:\n\nQuestion 5. Given the dimensions and the slope, with the velocity and discharge of a river in its ordinary state, required the area or section of the sluice which will raise the waters to a certain height, still allowing the same quantity of water to pass through? Such an operation may render the rivers navigable for small craft or rafts above the sluice.\n\nThe problem is reduced to the determination of the size of orifice which will discharge this water with a velocity competent to the height to which the river is to be raised; only we must take into consideration the velocity of the water above the sluice, considering it as produced by a fall which makes a part of the height productive of the whole velocity at the sluice. Therefore $H$, in our investigation, must consist of the height to which we mean to raise the waters, and the height which will produce the velocity with which the waters approach the sluice: $h$, or the depth of the stream, is the ordinary depth of the river. Then (using the former symbols) we have $eb \\frac{wh \\sqrt{N_g d}}{\\sqrt{2G} s (H-h)} = \\frac{Q}{\\sqrt{2G} (H-h)}$.\n\nIf the area of the sluice is known, and we would learn the height to which it will raise the river, we have $H-h = \\frac{Q^2}{2G e^2 b^2}$ for the expression of the rise of the water.\nwater above its ordinary level. But from this we must take the height which would produce the velocity of the river; so that if the sluice were as wide as the river, and were raised to the ordinary surface of the water,\n\n$$\\frac{Q^2}{2Gc^2L}$$\n\nwhich expresses the height that produces the velocity under the sluice, must be equal to the depth of the river, and $H-h$ will be zero.\n\nThe performance of aqueduct drains is a very important thing, and merits our attention in this place. While the art of managing waters, and of conducting them so as to answer our demands, renders us very important service by embellishing our habitations, or promoting our commercial intercourse, the art of draining creates as it were new riches, fertilizing tracts of bog or marsh, which was not only useless, but hurtful by its unwholesome exhalations, and converting them into rich pastures and gay meadows. A wild country, occupied by marshes which are inaccessible to herds or flocks, and serve only for the haunts of water-fowls, or the retreat of a few poor fishermen, when once it is freed from the waters in which it is drowned, opens its lap to receive the most precious seeds, is soon clothed in the richest garb, gives life and abundance to numerous herds, and never fails to become the delight of the industrious cultivator who has enfranchised it, and is attached to it by the labour which it cost him. In return, it procures him abundance, and supplies him with the means of daily augmenting its fertility. No species of agriculture exhibits such long-continued and progressive improvement. New families flock to the spot, and there multiply; and there nature seems the more eager to repay their labours, in proportion as she has been obliged, against her will, to keep her treasures locked up for a longer time, chilled by the waters. The countries newly inhabited by the human race, as is a great part of America, especially to the southward, are still covered to a great extent with marshes and lakes; and they would long remain in this condition, if population, daily making new advances, did not increase industry, by multiplying the cultivating hands, at the same time that it increases their wants. The Author of this beautiful world has at the beginning formed the great masses of mountain, has scooped out the dales and sloping hills, has traced out the courses, and even formed the beds of the rivers; but he has left to man the care of making his place of abode, and the field which must feed him, dry and comfortable. For this task is not beyond his powers, as the others are. Nay, by having this given to him in charge, he is richly repaid for his labour by the very state in which he finds those countries into which he penetrates for the first time. Being covered with lakes and forests, the juices of the soil are kept for him as it were in reserve. The air, the burning heat of the sun, and the continual wafting of rains, would have combined to expend and dissipate their vegetative powers, had the fields been exposed in the same degree to their action as the inhabited and cultivated countries, the most fertile moulds of which are long since lodged in the bottom of the ocean. All this would have been completely lost through the whole extent of South America, had it not been protected by the forests which man must cut down, by the rank herbage which he must burn, and by the marsh and bog which he must destroy by draining. Let not ungrateful man complain of this. It is his duty to take on himself the task of opening up treasures, preserved on purpose for him with so much judgement and care. If he has discretion and sensibility, he will even thank the Author of all good, who has thus hitherto treated him for his use. He will co-operate with his beneficent views, and will be careful not to proceed by wantonly snatching at present any partial good, and by picking out what is most easily got at, regardless of him who is to come afterwards to uncover and extract the remaining riches of the ground. A wise administration of such a country will think it their duty to leave a just share of this inheritance to their descendants, who are entitled to expect it as the last legatee. National plans of cultivation should be formed on this principle, that the steps taken by the present cultivators for realizing part of the riches of the infant country shall not obstruct the works which will afterwards be necessary for also obtaining the remainder. This is carefully attended to in Holland and in China. No man is allowed to conduct the drains, by which he recovers a piece of marsh, in such a way as to render it much more difficult for a neighbour, or even for his own successor, to drain another piece, although it may at present be quite inaccessible. There remains in the middle of the most cultivated countries many marshes, which industry has not yet attempted to drain, and where the legislature has not been at pains to prevent many little abuses which have produced elevations in the beds of rivers, and rendered the complete draining of some spots impossible. Administration should attend to such things, because their consequences are great. The sciences and arts, by which alone these difficult and costly jobs can be performed, should be protected, encouraged, and cherished. It is only from science that we can obtain principles to direct these arts. The problem of draining canals is one of the most important, and yet has hardly ever occupied the attention of the hydraulic speculator. We apprehend that M. Buat's theory will throw great light on it; and regret that the very limited condition of our present work will hardly afford room for a slight sketch of what may be done on the subject. We shall, however, attempt it by a general problem, which will involve most of the chief circumstances which occur in works of that kind.\n\n**Question 6.** Let the hollow ground A (fig. 2.) be in Fig. 2., undated by rains or springs, and have no outlet but the canal AB, by which it discharges its water into the neighbouring river BCDE, and that its surface is nearly on a level with that of the river at B. It can only drain when the river sinks in the droughts of summer; and even if it could then drain completely, the putrid marsh would only be an infecting neighbour. It may be proposed to drain it by one or more canals; and it is required to determine their lengths and other dimensions, so as to produce the best effects?\n\nIt is evident that there are many circumstances to determine the choice, and many conditions to be attended to.\n\nIf the canals AC, AD, AG, are respectively equal to the portions BC, BD, BE, of the river, and have the same slopes, they will have the same discharge; but they are not for this reason equivalent. The long canal AE may drain the marsh completely, while the short\none AC will only do it in part; because the difference of level between A and C is but inconsiderable. Also the freights of the river may totally obstruct the operation of AC, while the canal AE cannot be hurt by them, E being so much lower than C. Therefore the canal must be carried so far down the river, that no freights there shall ever raise the waters in the canal so high as to reduce the slope in the upper part of it to such a level that the current shall not be sufficient to carry off the ordinary produce of water in the marsh.\n\nStill the problem is indeterminate, admitting many solutions. This requisite discharge may be accomplished by a short but wide canal, or by a longer and narrower. Let us first see what solution can be made, so as to accomplish our purpose in the most economical manner, that is, by means of the smallest equation. We shall give the solution in the form of an example.\n\nSuppose that the daily produce of rains and springs raises the water 1/2 inch on an area of a square league, which gives about 120,000 cubic fathoms of water. Let the bottom of the basin be three feet below the surface of the freights in the river at B in winter. Also, that the slope of the river is 2 inches in 100 fathoms, or 3 inches deep, and that the canal is to be 6 feet deep.\n\nThe canal being supposed nearly parallel to the river, it must be at least 1800 fathoms long before it can be admitted into the river, otherwise the bottom of the bog will be lower than the mouth of the canal; and even then a hundred or two more fathoms added to this will give it so little slope, that an immense breadth will be necessary to make the discharge with so small a velocity. On the other hand, if the slope of the canal be made equal to that of the river, an extravagant length will be necessary before its admission into the river, and many obstacles may then intervene. And even then it must have a breadth of 13 feet, as may easily be calculated by the general hydraulic theorem. By receding from each of these extremes, we shall diminish the expense of excavation. Therefore,\n\nLet \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) be the breadth and length, and \\( h \\) the depth (6 feet), of the canal. Let \\( q \\) be the depth of the bog below the surface of the river, opposite to the basin, D the discharge in a second, and \\( \\frac{1}{a} \\) the slope of the river. We must make \\( h + y \\) a minimum, or \\( xy + yx = 0 \\).\n\nThe general formula gives the velocity\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{\\sqrt{N_g}}{\\sqrt{s - \\frac{1}{4} \\sqrt{1 + 1.6}}} \\cdot 3 (\\sqrt{d - 1})\n\\]\n\nThis would give \\( x \\) and \\( y \\); but the logarithmic term renders it very complicated. We may make use of the simple form\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{\\sqrt{N_g}}{\\sqrt{s}}, \\text{ making } \\sqrt{N_g} \\text{ nearly } 2y b.\n\\]\n\nThis will be sufficiently exact for all cases which do not deviate far from this, because the velocities are very nearly in the subduplicate ratio of the slopes.\n\nTo introduce these data into the equation, recollect that \\( V = \\frac{D}{h} \\); \\( d = \\frac{h}{x + 2h} \\). As to S, recollect that the canal being supposed of nearly equal length with the river, \\( \\frac{y}{a} \\) will express the whole difference of height, and \\( \\frac{y}{a} - q \\) is the difference of height for the canal.\n\nThis quantity being divided by \\( y \\), gives the value of \\( \\frac{1}{S} = \\frac{a - q}{y} \\). Therefore the equation for the canal becomes\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{N_g} \\left( \\frac{h}{x + 2h} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\left( \\frac{y}{a} - q \\right)\n\\]\n\nHence we deduce\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{N_g h^3 x^3}{a} \\left( \\frac{3 N_g h^3 x^3}{a} - D(x + 2h) \\right)\n\\]\n\nIf we substitute these values in the equation \\( y + x = 0 \\), and reduce it, we obtain finally,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{N_g h^3 x^3}{a D^2} - 3x = 8h.\n\\]\n\nIf we resolve this equation by making \\( N_g = (296)^2 \\), or 87616 inches; \\( h = 72 \\), \\( \\frac{1}{a} = \\frac{1}{300} \\), and \\( D = 518400 \\), we obtain \\( x = 392 \\) inches, or 32 feet 8 inches, and \\( \\frac{D}{h} \\), or \\( V = 1836 \\) inches. Now putting these values in the exact formula for the velocity, we obtain the slope of the canal, which is \\( \\frac{1}{100} \\), nearly 0.62 inches in 100 fathoms.\n\nLet \\( l \\) be the length of the canal in fathoms. As the river has 2 inches fall in 100 fathoms, the whole fall is \\( \\frac{2}{100} \\) and that of the canal is \\( \\frac{0.62}{100} \\). The difference of these two must be 3 feet, which is the difference between the river and the entry of the canal. We have therefore \\( \\left( \\frac{2}{100} - \\frac{0.62}{100} \\right) l = 36 \\) inches. Hence \\( l = 2604 \\) fathoms; and this multiplied by the section of the canal gives 14177 cubic fathoms of earth to be removed.\n\nThis may surely be done, in most cases, for eight shillings each cubic fathom, which does not amount to 6000l, a very moderate sum for completely draining of nine square miles of country.\n\nIn order to judge of the importance of this problem, we have added two other canals, one longer and the other shorter, having their widths and slopes so adjusted as to ensure the same performance.\n\n| Width | Velocity | Slope | Length | Excavation |\n|-------|----------|-------|--------|------------|\n| Feet  | Inches   |       |        |            |\n| 42    | 14.28    | 78.78 | 2221   | 15547      |\n| 34.7  | 18.36    | 78.78 | 2604   | 14177      |\n| 21    | 28.57    | 78.78 | 7381   | 25833      |\n\nWe have considered this important problem in its most simple state. If the basin is far from the river, so that the drains are not nearly parallel to it, and therefore have less slope attainable in their course, it is more difficult. Perhaps the best method is to try two very extreme cases and a middle one, and then a fourth, nearer to that extreme which differs least from the middle one in the\nthe quantity of excavation. This will point out on which side the minimum of excavation lies, and also the law by which it diminishes and afterwards increases. Then draw a line, on which set off from one end the lengths of the canals. At each length erect an ordinate representing the excavation; and draw a regular curve through the extremities of the ordinates. From that point of the curve which is nearest to the base line, draw another ordinate to the base. This will point out the best length of the canal with sufficient accuracy. The length will determine the slope, and this will give the width, by means of the general theorem. N.B. These draining canals must always come off from the basin with elevated entries. This will prevent the loss of much fall at the entry.\n\nTwo canals may sometimes be necessary. In this case expense may frequently be saved, by making one canal flow into the other. This, however, must be at such a distance from the basin, that the swell produced in the other by this addition may not reach back to the immediate neighbourhood of the basin, otherwise it would impede the performance of both. For this purpose, recourse must be had to Problem III. in No. 104. of the article RIVER. We must here observe, that in this respect canals differ exceedingly from rivers; rivers enlarge their beds, so as always to convey every increase of waters; but a canal may be gorged through its whole length, and will then greatly diminish its discharge. In order that the lower extremity of a canal may convey the waters of an equal canal admitted into it, their junction must be so far from the basin, that the swell occasioned by raising its waters nearly twice more (viz. in the subduplicate ratio of 1 to 2) may not reach back to the basin.\n\nThis observation points out another method of economy. Instead of one wide canal, we may make a narrower one of the whole length, and another narrow one reaching part of the way, and communicating with the long canal at a proper distance from the basin. But the lower extremity will now be too shallow to convey the waters of both. Therefore raise its banks by using the earth taken from its bed, which must at any rate be disposed of. Thus the waters will be conveyed, and the expense, even of the lower part of the long canal, will scarcely be increased.\n\nThese observations must suffice for an account of the management of open canals; and we proceed to the consideration of the conduct of water in pipes.\n\nThis is much more simple and regular, and the general theorem requires very trifling modifications for adapting it to the cases or questions that occur in the practice of the civil engineer. Pipes are always made round, and therefore \\(d\\) is always \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)th of the diameter. The velocity of water in a pipe which is in train, is\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{397(\\sqrt{d} - 0.1)}{\\sqrt{s - L \\sqrt{s + 1.6}}} - 0.3 (\\sqrt{d} - 0.1) \\text{ or } (\\sqrt{d} - 0.1) \\left( \\frac{397}{\\sqrt{s - L \\sqrt{s + 1.6}}} - 0.3 \\right).\n\\]\n\nThe chief questions are the following:\n\n**Quest. 1.** Given the height \\(H\\) of the reservoir above the place of delivery, and the diameter and length of the pipe, to find the quantity of water discharged in a second.\n\nLet \\(L\\) be the length, and \\(h\\) the fall which would produce the velocity with which the water enters the pipe, and actually flows in it, after overcoming all obstructions. This may be expressed in terms of the velocity by\n\n\\[\n\\frac{V^2}{2G}, \\quad G \\text{ denoting the acceleration of gravity, corresponding to the manner of entry.}\n\\]\n\nWhen no methods are adopted for facilitating the entry of the water, by a bell-shaped funnel or otherwise, \\(2G\\) may be assumed as \\(= 500\\) inches, or 42 feet, according as we measure the velocity in inches or feet. The slope is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{V^2}{2G} = \\frac{H}{L},\n\\]\n\nwhich must be put into the general formula.\n\nThis would make it very complicated. We may simplify it by the consideration that the velocity is very small in comparison of that arising from the height \\(H\\); consequently \\(h\\) is very small. Also, in the same pipe, the resistances are nearly in the duplicate ratio of the velocities when these are small, and when they differ little among themselves. Therefore make \\(b = \\frac{L}{h}\\), taking \\(h\\) by guess, a very little less than \\(H\\). Then compute the mean velocity \\(v\\) corresponding to these data, or take it from the table. If \\(h + \\frac{V^2}{2G} = H\\), we have found the mean velocity \\(V = v\\). If not, make the following proportion:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{V^2}{2G} = \\frac{H}{L} = \\frac{V^2}{2G} : \\frac{V^2}{2G},\n\\]\n\nwhich is the same with\n\n\\[\n\\frac{V^2}{2G} = \\frac{H}{L} = \\frac{V^2}{2G} : \\frac{V^2}{2G},\n\\]\n\nand \\(V^2\\) is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{V^2}{2G} = \\frac{H}{L} = \\frac{V^2}{2G} : \\frac{V^2}{2G}.\n\\]\n\nIf the pipe has any bendings, they must be calculated for in the manner mentioned in the article RIVER, No. 101; and the head of water necessary for overcoming this additional resistance being called \\(\\frac{V^2}{m}\\), the last proportion must be changed for\n\n\\[\n\\frac{V^2}{2G} + \\frac{1}{m} : \\frac{V^2}{2G} = H : V^2.\n\\]\n\n**Quest. 2.** Given the height of the reservoir, the length of the pipe, and the quantity of water which is to be drawn off in a second; to find the diameter of the pipe which will draw it off?\n\nLet \\(d\\) be considered as \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)th of the diameter, and let \\(r : c\\) represent the ratio of the diameter of a circle to its circumference. The section of the pipe is \\(4c d^2\\). Let the quantity of water per second be \\(Q\\); then \\(\\frac{Q}{4c d^2}\\) is the mean velocity. Divide the length of the pipe by the height of the reservoir above the place of delivery, diminished by a very small quantity, and call the quotient \\(S\\). Consider this as the slope of the conduit; the general formula now becomes\n\n\\[\n\\frac{Q}{4c d^2} = \\frac{397(\\sqrt{d} - 0.1)}{\\sqrt{s - L \\sqrt{s + 1.6}}} - 0.3 (\\sqrt{d} - 0.1) \\text{ or } (\\sqrt{d} - 0.1) \\left( \\frac{397}{\\sqrt{s - L \\sqrt{s + 1.6}}} - 0.3 \\right).\n\\]\nWe may neglect the last term in every case of civil practice, and also the small quantity \\( o_1 \\). This gives the very simple formula,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{Q}{4c d^2} = \\frac{307}{\\sqrt{S}} (\\sqrt{d - o_1}) - o_3 (\\sqrt{d - o_1}). \n\\]\n\nThis process gives the diameter somewhat too small. But we easily rectify this error by computing the quantity delivered by the pipe, which will differ a little from the quantity proposed. Then observing, by this equation, that two pipes having the same length and the same slope give quantities of water, of which the squares are nearly as the fifth powers of the diameter, we form a new diameter in this proportion, which will be almost perfectly exact.\n\nIt may be observed that the height assumed for determining the slope in these two questions will seldom differ more than an inch or two from the whole height of the reservoir above the place of delivery; for in conduits of a few hundred feet long, the velocity seldom exceeds four feet per second, which requires only a head of three inches.\n\nAs no inconvenience worth minding results from making the pipes a tenth of an inch or so wider than is barely sufficient, and as this generally is more than the error arising from even a very erroneous assumption of \\( h \\), the answer first obtained may be augmented by one or two tenths of an inch, and then we may be confident that our conduit will draw off the intended quantity of water.\n\nWe presume that every person who assumes the name of engineer knows how to reduce the quantity of water measured in gallons, pints, or other denominations, to cubic inches, and can calculate the gallons, &c., furnished by a pipe of known diameter, moving with a velocity that is measured in inches per second. We farther suppose that all care is taken in the construction of the conduit, to avoid obstructions occasioned by lumps of solder hanging in the inside of the pipes; and, particularly, that all the cocks and plugs by the way have waterways equal to the section of the pipe. Undertakers are most tempted to fail here, by making the cocks too small, because large cocks are very costly. But the employer should be scrupulously attentive to this; because a simple contraction of this kind may be the throwing away of many hundreds of pounds in a wide pipe, which yields no more water than can pass through the small cock.\n\nThe chief obstructions arise from the deposition of sand or mud in the lower parts of pipes, or the collection of air in the upper parts of their bendings. The velocity being always very moderate, such depositions of heavy matters are unavoidable. The utmost care should therefore be taken to have the water freed from all such things at its entry by proper filtration; and there ought to be cleansing plugs at the lower parts of the bendings, or rather a very little way beyond them. When these are opened, the water issues with greater velocity, and carries the depositions with it.\n\nIt is much more difficult to get rid of the air which chokes the pipes by lodging in their upper parts. This is sometimes taken in along with the water at the reservoir, when the entry of the pipe is too near the surface. This should be carefully avoided, and it costs no trouble to do so. If the entry of the pipe is two feet under the surface, no air can ever get in. Floats should be placed above the entries, having lids hanging from them, which will shut the pipe before the water runs too low.\n\nBut air is also disengaged from spring-water by merely passing along the pipe. When pipes are supplied by an engine, air is very often drawn in by the pumps in a disengaged state. It is also disengaged from its state of chemical union, when the pumps have a suction-pipe of 10 or 12 feet, which is very common. In whatever way it is introduced, it collects in all the upper part of bendings, and chokes the passage, so that sometimes not a drop of water is delivered. Our cocks should be placed there, which should be opened frequently by persons who have this in charge. Defagulators describes a contrivance to be placed on all such eminences, which does this of itself. It is a pipe with a cock, terminating in a small cistern. The key of the cock has a hollow ball of copper at the end of a lever. When there is no air in the main pipe, water comes out by this discharger, fills the cistern, raises the ball, and thus shuts the cock. But when the bend of the main contains air, it rises into the cistern, and occupies the upper part of it. Thus the floating bail falls down, the cock opens and lets out the air, and the cistern again filling with water, the ball rises, and the cock is again shut.\n\nA very neat contrivance for this purpose was invented by the late Professor Rusell of Edinburgh. The cylindrical pipe BCDE (fig. 3.), at the upper end of a Fig. 3. bending of the main, is screwed on, the upper end of which is a flat plate perforated with a small hole F. This pipe contains a hollow copper cylinder G, to the upper part of which is fastened a piece of soft leather H. When there is air in the pipe, it comes out by the hole A, and occupies the discharger, and then escapes through the hole F. The water follows, and rising in the discharger, lifts up the hollow cylinder G, causing the leather H to apply itself to the plate CD, and thus the hole. Thus the air is discharged without the smallest loss of water.\n\nIt is of the most material consequence that there be no contraction in any part of a conduit. This is evident; but it is also prudent to avoid all unnecessary enlargements. For when the conduit is full of water moving along it, the velocity in every section is inversely proportional to the area of the section: it is therefore diminished wherever the pipe is enlarged; but it must again be increased where the pipe contracts. This cannot be without expending force in the acceleration. This consumes part of the impelling power, whether this be a head of water, or the force of an engine. See what is said on this subject in the article PUMPS, No. 83, &c. Nothing is gained by any enlargement; and every contraction, by requiring an augmentation of velocity, employs a part of the impelling force precisely equal to the weight of a column of water whose base is the contracted passage, and whose height is the fall which would produce a velocity equal to this augmentation. This point seems to have been quite overlooked by engineers of the first eminence, and has in many instances greatly\ngreatly diminished the performance of their best works. It is no less detrimental in open canals; because at every contraction a small fall is required for restoring the velocity lost in the enlargement of the canal, by which the general slope and velocity are diminished. Another point which must be attended to in the conducting of water is, that the motion should not be sub- junctive, but continuous. When the water is to be driven along a main by the strokes of a reciprocating engine, it should be forced into an air-box, the spring of which may preserve it in motion along the whole subsequent main. If the water is brought to rest at every successive stroke of the piston, the whole mass must again be put in motion through the whole length of the main. This requires the same useless expenditure of power as to communicate this motion to as much dead matter; and this is over and above the force which may be necessary for raising the water to a certain height; which is the only circumstance that enters into the calculation of the power of the pump-engine.\n\nAn air-box removes this imperfection, because it keeps up the motion during the returning stroke of the piston. The compression of the air by the active stroke of the piston must be such as to continue the impulse in opposition to the contrary pressure of the water (if it is to be raised to some height), and in opposition to the friction or other resistances which arise from the motion that the water really acquires. Indeed a very considerable force is employed here also in changing the motion of the water, which is forced out of the capacious air-box into the narrow pipe; and when this change of motion is not judiciously managed, the expenditure of power may be as great as if all were brought to rest and again put into motion. It may even be greater, by causing the water to move in the opposite direction to its former motion. Of such consequence is it to have all these circumstances scientifically considered. It is in such particulars, unheeded by the ordinary herd of engineers or pump-makers, that the superiority of an intelligent practitioner is to be seen.\n\nAnother material point in the conduct of water in pipes is the distribution of it to the different persons who have occasion for it. This is rarely done from the rising main. It is usual to send the whole into a cistern, from which it is afterwards conducted to different places in separate pipes. Till the discovery of the general theorem by the chevalier Buat, this has been done with great inaccuracy. Engineers think that the different purchasers from water-works receive in proportion to their respective bargains when they give them pipes whose areas are proportional to the payments. But we now see, that when these pipes are of any considerable length, the waters of a larger pipe run with a greater velocity than those of a smaller pipe having the same slope. A pipe of two inches diameter will give much more water than four pipes of one inch diameter; it will give as much as five and a half such pipes, or more; because the squares of the discharges are very nearly as the fifth powers of the diameters. This point ought therefore to be carefully considered in the bargains made with the proprietors of water-works, and the payments made in this proportion. Perhaps the most unexceptionable method would be to make a double distribution. Let the water be first let off in its proper proportions into a second series of small cisterns, and let each have a pipe which will convey the whole water that is discharged into it. The first distribution may be made entirely by pipes of one inch in diameter; this would leave nothing to the calculation of the distributor, for every man would pay in proportion to the number of such pipes which run into his own cistern.\n\nIn many cases, however, water is distributed by pipes derived from a main. And here another circumstance comes into action. When water is passing along a pipe, its pressure on the sides of the pipe is diminished by its velocity; and if a pipe is now derived from it, the quantity drawn off is also diminished in the subduplicate ratio of the pressures. If the pressure is reduced to one-fourth, one-ninth, one-sixteenth, &c., the discharge from the lateral pipe is reduced to one-half, one-third, one-fourth, &c.\n\nIt is therefore of great importance to determine, what this diminution of pressure is which arises from the motion along the main.\n\nIt is plain, that if the water suffered no resistance in the main, its velocity would be that with which it entered, and it would pass along without exerting any pressure. If the pipe were shut at the end, the pressure on the sides would be the full pressure of the head of water. If the head of water remain the same, and the end of the tube be contracted, but not stopped entirely, the velocity in the pipe is diminished. If we would have the velocity in the pipe with this contracted mouth augmented to what it was before the contraction was made, we must employ the pressure of a piston, or of a head of water. This is propagated through the fluid, and thus a pressure is immediately excited on the sides of the pipe. New obstructions of any kind, arising from friction or any other cause, produce a diminution of velocity in the pipe. But when the natural velocity is checked, the particles react on what obstructs their motion; and this action is uniformly propagated through a perfect fluid in every direction. The resistance therefore which we thus ascribe to friction, produces the same lateral pressure, which a contraction of the orifice, which equally diminishes the velocity in the pipe, would do. Indeed this is demonstrable from any distinct notions that we can form of these obstructions. They proceed from the want of perfect smoothness, which obliges the particles next the sides to move in undulated lines. This excites transverse forces in the same manner as any constrained curvilinear motion. A particle in its undulated path tends to escape from it, and acts on the lateral particles in the same manner that it would do if moving singly in a capillary tube having the same undulations; it would press on the concave side of every such undulation. Thus a pressure is exerted among the particles, which is propagated to the sides of the pipe; or the diminution of velocity may arise from a viscosity or want of perfect fluidity. This obliges the particle immediately pressed to drag along with it another particle which is withheld by adhesion to the sides. This requires additional pressure from a piston, or an additional head of water; and this pressure also is propagated to the sides of the pipe.\n\nHence it should follow, that the pressure which water in motion exerts on the sides of its conduit is equal to that which is competent to the head of water which impels\nimpels it into the pipe, diminished by the head of water competent to the actual velocity with which it moves along the pipe. Let $H$ represent the head of water which impels it into the entry of the pipe, and $h$ the head which would produce the actual velocity; then $H-h$ is the column which would produce the pressure exerted on its sides.\n\nThis is abundantly verified by very simple experiments. Let an upright pipe be inserted into the side of the main pipe. When the water runs out by the mouth of the main, it will rise in this branch till the weight of the column balances the pressure that supports it; and if we then ascertain the velocity of the issuing water by means of the quantity discharged, and compute the head or height necessary for producing this velocity, and subtract this from the height of water above the entry of the main, we shall find the height in the branch precisely equal to their difference. Our readers may see this by examining the experiments related by Gravelande, and fill better by consulting the experiments narrated by Bo\u00ebtius, \u00a7 558, which are detailed with great minuteness; the results corresponded accurately with this proposition. The experiments indeed were not heights of water supported by this pressure, but water expelled by it through the same orifice. Indeed the truth of the proposition appears in every way we can consider the motion of water. And as it is of the first importance in the practice of conducting water (for reasons which will presently appear), it merits a particular attention. When an inclined tube is in train, the accelerating power of the water (or its weight diminished in the proportion of the length of the oblique column to its vertical height, or its weight multiplied by the fraction $\\frac{1}{3}$, which expresses the slope), is in equilibrium with the obstructions; and therefore it exerts no pressure on the pipe but what arises from its weight alone. Any part of it would continue to slide down the inclined plane with a constant velocity, though detached from what follows it. It therefore derives no pressure from the head of water which impelled it into the pipe. The same must be said of a horizontal pipe infinitely smooth, or opposing no resistance. The water would move in this pipe with the full velocity due to the head of water which impelled it into the entry. But when the pipe opposes an obstruction, the head of water is greater than that which would impel it into the pipe with the velocity that it actually has in it; and this additional pressure is propagated along the pipe, where it is balanced by the actual resistance, and therefore excites a quagga verium pressure on the pipe. In short, whatever part of the head of water in the reservoir, or of the pressure which impels it along the tube, is not employed in producing velocity, is employed in acting against some obstruction, and excites (by the reaction of this obstruction) an equal pressure on the tube. The rule therefore is general, but is subject to some modifications which deserve our attention.\n\nIn the simply inclined pipe BC (fig. 4.), the pressure on any point $S$ is equal to that of the head $AB$ of water which impels the water into the pipe, wanting or minus that of the head of water which would communicate to it the velocity with which it actually moves. This we shall call $x$, and consider it as the weight of a column of water whose length also is $x$. In like manner $H$ may be the column $AB$, which impels the water into the pipe, and would communicate a certain velocity; and $h$ may represent the column which would communicate the actual velocity. We have therefore $x = H - h$.\n\nIn the pipe HIKL, the pressure at the point I is $AH - h - IO$, $= H - h - IO$; and the pressure at K is $H - h + PK$.\n\nAnd in the pipe DEFG, the pressure on E is $AR - h - EM$, $= H - h - EM$; and the pressure at F is $H - h + FN$.\n\nWe must carefully distinguish this pressure on any square inch of the pipe from the obstruction or resistance which that inch actually exerts, and which is part of the cause of this pressure. The pressure is (by the laws of hydrostatics) the same with that exerted on the water by a square inch of the piston or forcing head of water. This must balance the united obstructions of the whole pipe, in as far as they are not balanced by the relative weight of the water in an enclosed pipe. Whatever be the inclination of a pipe, and the velocity of the water in it, there is a certain part of this resistance which may not be balanced by the tendency which the water has to slide along it, provided the pipe be long enough; or if the pipe is too short, the tendency down the pipe may more than balance all the resistances that obtain below. In the first case, this surplus must be balanced by an additional head of water; and in the latter case the pipe is not in train, and the water will accelerate. There is something in the mechanism of these motions which makes a certain length of pipe necessary for bringing it into train; a certain portion of the surface which acts in concert in obstructing the motion. We do not completely understand this circumstance, but we can form a pretty distinct notion of its mode of acting. The film of water contiguous to the pipe is withheld by the obstruction, but glides along; the film immediately within this is withheld by the outer film, but glides through it; and thus all the concentric films glide within those around them, somewhat like the sliding tubes of a spyglass, when we draw it out by taking hold of the end of the innermost. Thus the second film passes beyond the first or outermost, and becomes the outermost, and rubs along the tube. The third does the same in its turn; and thus the central filaments come at last to the outside, and all sustain their greatest possible obstruction. When this is accomplished, the pipe is in train. This requires a certain length, which we cannot determine by theory. We see, however, that pipes of greater diameter must require a greater length, and this in a proportion which is probably that of the number of filaments, or the square of the diameter. Buat found this supposition agree well enough with his experiments. A pipe of one inch in diameter sustained no change of velocity by gradually shortening it till he reduced it to six feet, and then it discharged a little more water. A pipe of two inches diameter gave a sensible augmentation of velocity when shortened to 25 feet. He therefore says, that the square of the diameter in inches, multiplied by 72, will express (in inches) the length necessary for putting any pipe in train.\n\nThe resistance exerted by a square inch of the pipe makes but a small part of the pressure which the whole resistances\nresistances occasion to be exerted there before they can be overcome. The resistance may be represented by \\( \\frac{d}{r} \\) when \\( d \\) is the hydraulic depth (one-fourth of the diameter), and \\( r \\) the length of a column whose vertical height is one inch, and it is the relative weight of a column of water whose base is a square inch, and height is \\( d \\). For the resistance of any length \\( s \\) of pipe which is in train, is equal to the tendency of the water to slide down (being balanced by it); that is, is equal to the weight of this column multiplied by \\( \\frac{1}{s} \\). The magnitude of this column is had by multiplying its length by its section. The section is the product of the border \\( h \\) or circumference, multiplied by the mean depth \\( d \\), or it is \\( bd \\). This multiplied by the length, is \\( bds \\); and this multiplied by the flope \\( \\frac{1}{s} \\) is \\( bds \\), the relative weight of the column whose length is \\( s \\). The relative weight of one inch is therefore \\( \\frac{bd}{s} \\); and this is in equilibrium with the resistance of a ring of the pipe one inch broad. This, when unfolded, is a parallelogram \\( b \\) inches in length. One inch of this therefore is \\( \\frac{d}{s} \\), the relative weight of a column of water having \\( d \\) for its height and a square inch for its base. Suppose the pipe four inches in diameter, and the flope \\( = 253 \\), the resistance is one grain; for an inch of water weighs 253 grains.\n\nThis knowledge of the preflure of water in motion is of great importance. In the management of rivers and canals it instructs us concerning the damages which they produce in their beds by tearing up the soil; it informs us of the strength which we must give to the banks; but it is of more consequence in the management of close conduits. By this we must regulate the strength of our pipes; by this also we must ascertain the quantities of water which may be drawn off by lateral branches from any main conduit.\n\nWith respect to the first of these objects, where security is our sole concern, it is proper to consider the preflure in the most unfavourable circumstances, viz., when the end of the main is shut. This case is not unfrequent. Nay, when the water is in motion, its velocity in a conduit seldom exceeds a very few feet in a second. Eight feet per second requires only one foot of water to produce it. We should therefore estimate the strain on all conduits by the whole height of the reservoir.\n\nIn order to adjust the strength of a pipe to the strain, we may conceive it as consisting of two half cylinders of insuperable strength, joined along the two seams, where the strength is the same with the ordinary strength of the materials of which it is made. The inside preflure tends to burst the pipe by tearing open the seams; and each of these two seams is equal to the weight of a column of water whose height is the depth of the seam below the surface of the reservoir, and whose base is an inch broad and a diameter of the pipe in length. This follows from the common principles of hydrostatics.\n\nSuppose the pipe to be of lead, one foot in diameter and 100 feet under the surface of the reservoir. Water weighs 62\u00bd pounds per foot. The base of our column is therefore \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)th of a foot, and the tendency to burst the pipe is \\( 100 \\times 62\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 6250 \\), or 521 pounds nearly. Therefore an inch of one seam is strained by 260\u00bd pounds. A rod of lead one inch square is pulled alaund by 860 pounds (see Strength of Materials, No. 40.). Therefore, if the thickness of the seam is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) inches, or one-third of an inch, it will just withstand this strain. But we must make it much stronger than this, especially if the pipe leads from an engine which sends the water along it by flaps. Belidor and Defaguliers have given tables of the thicknesses and weights of pipes which experience has found sufficient for the different materials and depths. Defaguliers says, that a leaden pipe of three-fourths of an inch in thickness is strong enough for a height of 140 feet and diameter of seven inches. From this we may calculate all others. Belidor says, that a leaden pipe 12 inches diameter and 60 feet deep should be half an inch thick; but these things will be more properly computed by means of the list given in No. 40 of the article Strength of Materials.\n\nThe application which we are most anxious to make of the knowledge of the preflure of moving waters is the derivation from a main conduit by lateral branches. This occurs very frequently in the distribution of waters among the inhabitants of towns; and it is so imperfectly understood by the greatest part of those who take the name of engineers, that individuals have no security that they shall get even one half of the water they bargain and pay for; yet this may be as accurately ascertained as any other problem in hydraulics by means of our general theorem. The case therefore merits our particular attention.\n\nIt appears to be determined already, when we have ascertained the preflures by which the water is impelled into these lateral pipes, especially after we have said that the experiments of Boffut on the actual discharges from a lateral pipe fully confirm the theoretical doctrine. But much remains to be considered. We have seen that there is a vast difference between the discharge made through a hole, or even through a short pipe, and the discharge from the far end of a pipe derived from a main conduit. And even when this has been ascertained by our new theory, the discharge thus modified will be found considerably different from the real state of things: For when water is flowing along a main with a known velocity, and therefore exerting a known preflure on the circle which we propose for the entry of a branch, if we insert a branch there water will go along it: but this will generally make a considerable change in the motion along the main, and therefore in the preflure which is to expel the water. It also makes a considerable change in the whole quantity which passes along the anterior part of the main, and a still greater change on what moves along that part of it which lies beyond the branch: it therefore affects the quantity necessary for the whole supply, the force that is required for propelling it, and the quantity delivered by other branches. This part therefore of the management of water in conduits is of considerable importance and intricacy. We can propose in this place nothing more than a solution of such leading questions as involve the chief circumstances, recommending to our readers the perusal of original works on this subject. M. Boffut's experiments\nexperiments are fully competent to the establishment of the fundamental principle. The hole through which the lateral discharges were made was but a few feet from the reservoir. The pipe was successively lengthened, by which the resistances were increased, and the velocity diminished. But this did not affect the lateral discharges, except by affecting the pressures; and the discharges from the end of the main were supposed to be the same as when the lateral pipe was not inserted. Although this was not strictly true, the difference was insensible, because the lateral pipe had but about the 18th part of the area of the main.\n\nSuppose that the discharge from the reservoir remains the same after the derivation of this branch, then the motion of the water all the way to the insertion of the branch is the same as before; but, beyond this, the discharge is diminished by all that is discharged by the branch, with the head equivalent to the pressure on the side. The discharge by the lower end of the main being diminished, the velocity and resistance in it are also diminished. Therefore the difference between \\( x \\) and the head employed to overcome the friction in this second case, would be a needless or inefficient part of the whole load at the entry, which is impossible; for every force produces an effect, or it is destroyed by some reaction. The effect of the forcing head of water is to produce the greatest discharge corresponding to the obstructions; and thus the discharge from the reservoir, or the supply to the main, must be augmented by the insertion of the branch, if the forcing head of water remains the same. A greater portion therefore of the forcing head was employed in producing a greater discharge at the entry of the main, and the remainder, less than \\( x \\), produced the pressure on the sides. This head was the one competent to the obstructions resulting from the velocity beyond the insertion of the branch; and this velocity, diminished by the discharge already made, was less than that at the entry, and even than that of the main without a branch. This will appear more distinctly by putting the case into the form of an equation. Therefore let \\( H - x \\) be the height due to the velocity at the entry, of which the effect obtains only horizontally. The head \\( x \\) is the only one which acts on the sides of the tube, tending to produce the discharge by the branch, at the same time that it must overcome the obstructions beyond the branch. If the orifice did not exist, and if the force producing the velocity on a short tube be represented by \\( xG \\), and the section of the main be \\( A \\), the supply at the entry of the main would be \\( A \\sqrt{\\frac{x}{H}} \\); and if the orifice had no influence on the value of \\( x \\), the discharge by the orifice would be \\( D \\sqrt{\\frac{x}{H}} \\), \\( D \\) being its discharge by means of the head \\( H \\), when the end of the main is shut; for the discharges are in the subduplicate ratio of the heads of water by which they are expelled; and therefore \\( \\sqrt{H} : \\sqrt{x} = D : D \\sqrt{\\frac{x}{H}} \\). But we have seen that \\( x \\) must diminish; and we know that the obstructions are nearly as the square roots of the velocities, when these do not differ much among themselves. Therefore calling \\( y \\) the pressure or head which balances the resistances of the main without a branch, while \\( x \\) is the head necessary for the main with a branch, we may institute this proportion, \\( y : H - y = \\frac{x(H-y)}{y} \\); and this 4th term will express the head producing the velocity in the main beyond the branch (as \\( H - y \\) would have done in a main without a branch). This velocity beyond the branch will be \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{2G}{x(H-y)}} \\), and the discharge at the end will be \\( \\Delta \\sqrt{\\frac{2G}{x(H-y)}} \\). If to this we add the discharge of the branch, the sum will be the whole discharge, and therefore the whole supply. Therefore we have the following equation, \\( A \\sqrt{\\frac{2G}{H-y}} + D \\sqrt{\\frac{x}{H}} \\). From this we deduce the value of \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2GHA^2}{(A \\sqrt{\\frac{2G}{H-y}} + D \\sqrt{\\frac{x}{H}})^2 + 2GA^2}\n\\]\n\nThis value of \\( x \\) being substituted in the equation of the discharge of the branch, which was \\( D \\sqrt{\\frac{x}{H}} \\), will give the discharges required, and they will differ so much the more from the discharges calculated according to the simple theory, as the velocity in the main is greater. By the simple theory, we mean the supposition that the lateral discharges are such as would be produced by the head \\( H - h \\), where \\( H \\) is the height of the reservoir, and \\( h \\) the head due to the actual velocity in the main.\n\nAnd thus it appears that the proportion of the discharge by a lateral pipe from a main that is shut at the far end, and the discharge from a main that is open, depends not only on the pressures, but also on the size of the lateral pipe, and its distance from the reservoir. When it is large, it greatly alters the train of the main, under the same head, by altering the discharge at its extremity, and the velocity in it beyond the branch; and if it be near the reservoir, it greatly alters the train, because the diminished velocity takes place through a greater extent, and there is a greater diminution of the resistances.\n\nWhen the branch is taken off at a considerable distance from the reservoir, the problem becomes more complicated, and the head \\( x \\) is resolved into two parts; one of which balances the resistance in the first part of the main, and the other balances the resistances beyond the lateral pipe, with a velocity diminished by the discharge from the branch.\u2014A branch at the end of the main produces very little change in the train of the pipe.\n\nWhen the lateral discharge is great, the train may be so altered, that the remaining part of the main will not run full, and then the branch will not yield the same quantity. The velocity in a very long horizontal tube may be so small (by a small head of water and great obstructions in a very long tube) that it will just run full. An orifice made in its upper side will yield nothing; and yet a small tube inserted into it will carry a column almost as high as the reservoir. So that we cannot judge in all cases of the pressures by the discharges, and vice versa.\nIf there be an inclined tube, having a head greater than what is competent to the velocity, we may bring it into train by an opening on its upper side near the reservoir. This will yield some water, and the velocity will diminish in the tube till it is in train. If we should now enlarge the hole, it will yield no more water than before.\n\nAnd thus we have pointed out the chief circumstances which affect their lateral discharges. The discharges are afterwards modified by the conduits in which they are conveyed to their places of destination. These being generally of small dimensions, for the sake of economy, the velocity is much diminished. But, at the same time, it approaches nearer to that which the same conduit would bring directly from the reservoir, because its small velocity will produce a less change in the train of the main conduit.\n\nWe should now treat of jets of water, which still make an ornament in the magnificent pleasure grounds of the wealthy. Some of these are indeed grand objects, such as the two at Peterhoff in Russia, which spout about 60 feet high a column of nine inches diameter, which falls again, and shakes the ground with its blow. Even a spout of an inch or two inches diameter, lancing to the height of 150 feet, is a gay object, and greatly enlivens a pleasure-ground; especially when the changes of a gentle breeze bend the jet to one side. But we have no room left for treating this subject, which is of some nicety; and must conclude this article with a very short account of the management of water as an active power for impelling machinery.\n\nII. Of Machinery driven by Water.\n\nThis is a very comprehensive article, including almost every possible species of mill. It is no less important, and it is therefore matter of regret, that we cannot enter into the detail which it deserves. The mere description of the immense variety of mills which are in general use, would fill volumes, and a scientific description of their principles and maxims of construction would almost form a complete body of mechanical science. But this is far beyond the limits of a work like ours. Many of these machines have been already described under their proper names, or under the articles which give an account of their manufactures; and for others we must refer our readers to the original works, where they are described in minute detail. The great academical collection Des Arts et Metiers, published at Paris in many folio volumes, contains a description of the peculiar machinery of many mills; and the volumes of the Encyclop\u00e9die M\u00e9thodique, which particularly relate to the mechanic arts, already contain many more. All that we can do in this place is, to consider the chief circumstances that are common to all water-mills, and from which all must derive their efficacy. These circumstances are to be found in the manner of employing water as an acting power, and most of them are comprehended in the construction of water-wheels. When we have explained the principles and the maxims of construction of a water-wheel, every reader conversant in mechanics knows, that the axis of this wheel may be employed to transmit the force impressed on it to any species of machinery. Therefore nothing subsequent to this can with propriety be considered as water-works.\n\nWater-wheels are of two kinds, distinguished by the manner in which water is made an impelling power, viz. by its weight, or by its impulse. This requires a very different form and manner of adaptation; and this forms an offensive distinction, sufficiently obvious to give a name to each class. When water is made to act by its weight, it is delivered from the spout as high on the wheel as possible, that it may continue long to press it down; but when it is made to strike the wheel, it is delivered as low as possible, that it may have previously acquired a great velocity. And thus the wheels are said to be overshot or undershot.\n\nOf Overshot Wheels.\n\nThis is nothing but a frame of open buckets, so disposed round the rim of a wheel as to receive the water delivered from a spout; so that one side of the wheel is loaded with water, while the other is empty. The consequence must be, that the loaded side must descend. By this motion the water runs out of the lower buckets, while the empty buckets of the rising side of the wheel come under the spout in their turn, and are filled with water.\n\nIf it were possible to construct the buckets in such a manner as to remain completely filled with water till they come to the very bottom of the wheel, the pressure with which the water urges the wheel round its axis would be the same as if the extremity of the horizontal radius were continually loaded with a quantity of water sufficient to fill a square pipe, whose section is equal to that of the bucket, and whose length is the diameter of the wheel. For let the buckets BD and EF (fig. 5.) Fig. 5. be compared together, the arches DB and EF are equal. The mechanical energy of the water contained in the bucket EF, or the pressure with which its weight urges the wheel, is the same as if all this water were hung on that point T of the horizontal arm CF, where it is cut by the vertical or plumb-line BT. This is plain from the most elementary principles of mechanics. Therefore the effect of the bucket BD is to that of the bucket EF as CT to CF or CB. Draw the horizontal lines PB b b, QD d d. It is plain, that if BD is taken very small, so that it may be considered as a straight line, BD : BO = CB : BP, and EF : b d = CF : CT, and EF \u00d7 CT = b d \u00d7 CF. Therefore if the prism of water, whose vertical section is b d \u00d7 d, were hung on at F, its force to urge the wheel round would be the same as that of the water lying in the bucket BD. The same may be said of every bucket; and the effective pressure of the whole ring of water A f HKFI, in its natural situation, is the same with the pillar of water a b h a hung on at F. And the effect of any portion BF of this ring is the same with that of the corresponding portion b f fb of the vertical pillar. We do not take into account the small difference which arises from the depth B or F f, because we may suppose the circle described through the centres of gravity of the buckets. And in the farther prosecution of this subject, we shall take similar liberties, with the view of simplifying the subject, and saving time to the reader.\n\nBut such a state of the wheel is impossible. The bucket at the very top of the wheel may be completely filled with water; but when it comes into the oblique position BD, a part of the water must run over the outer edge v, and the bucket will only retain the quantity\ntity ZBD; and if the buckets are formed by partitions directed to the axis of the wheel, the whole water must be run out by the time that they descend to the level of the axis. To prevent this many contrivances have been adopted. The wheel has been surrounded with a hoop or sweep, consisting of a circular board, which comes almost into contact with the rim of the wheel, and terminates at H, where the water is allowed to run off. But unless the work is executed with uncommon accuracy, the wheel made exactly round, and the sweep exactly fitting it, a great quantity of water escapes between them; and there is a very sensible obstruction to the motion of such a wheel, from something like friction between the water and the sweep. Froth also effectually stops the motion of such a wheel. Sweeps have therefore been generally laid aside, although there are situations where they might be used with good effect.\n\nMillwrights have turned their whole attention to the giving a form to the buckets which shall enable them to retain the water along a great portion of the circumference of the wheel. It would be endless to describe all these contrivances; and we shall therefore content ourselves with one or two of the most approved. The intelligent reader will readily see that many of the circumstances which concur in producing the ultimate effect (such as the facility with which the water is received into the buckets, the place which it is to occupy during the progress of the bucket from the top to the bottom of the wheel, the readiness with which they are evacuated, or the chance that the water has of being dragged beyond the bottom of the wheel by its adhesion, &c., &c.) are such as do not admit of precise calculation or reasoning about their merits; and that this or that form can seldom be evidently demonstrated to be the very best possible. But, at the same time, he will see the general reasons of preference, and his attention will be directed to circumstances which must be attended to, in order to have a good bucketed wheel.\n\nFig. 6. is the outline of a wheel having 40 buckets. The ring of board contained between the concentric circles QDS and PAR, making the ends of the buckets, is called the Shrouding, in the language of the art, and QP is called the depth of shrouding. The inner circle PAR is called the Sole of the wheel, and usually consists of boards nailed to strong wooden rings of compass timber of considerable scantling, firmly united with the Arms or radii. The partitions, which determine the form of the buckets, consist of three different planes or boards AB, BC, CD, which are variously named by different artists. We have heard them named the Start or Shoulder, the Arm, and the Wrist (probably for wrist, on account of the resemblance of the whole line to the human arm); B is also called the Elbow.\n\nFig. 7. represents a small portion of the same bucketing on a larger scale, that the proportions of the parts may be more distinctly seen. AG, the sole of one bucket, is made about 1/3th more than the depth GH of the shrouding. The start AB is 1/3 of AI. The plane BC is so inclined to AB that it would pass through H; but it is made to terminate in C, in such a manner that FC is 2/3ths of GH or AI. Then CD is so placed that HD is about 1/3th of IH.\n\nBy this construction, it follows that the area FABC is very nearly equal to DABC; so that the water which will fill the space FABC will all be contained in the bucket when it shall come into such a position that AD is a horizontal line; and the line AB will then make an angle of nearly 35\u00b0 with the vertical, or the bucket will be 35\u00b0 from the perpendicular. If the bucket descend so much lower than one half of the water runs out, the line AB will make an angle of 25\u00b0, or 25\u00b0 nearly, with the vertical. Therefore the wheel, filled to the degree now mentioned, will begin to lose water at about 1/3th of the diameter from the bottom, and half of the water will be discharged from the lowest bucket, about 1/3th of the diameter farther down. These situations of the discharging bucket are marked T and V in fig. 6. Had a greater proportion of the buckets been filled with water when they were under the spout, the discharge would have begun at a greater height from the bottom, and we should lose a greater portion of the whole fall of water. The loss by the present construction is less than 1/10th (supposing the water to be delivered into the wheel at the very top), and may be estimated at about 1/10th; for the loss is the versed sine of the angle which the radius of the bucket makes with the vertical. The versed sine of 35\u00b0 is nearly 1/3th of the radius (being 0.18085), or 1/10th of the diameter. It is evident, that if only 1/3 of this water were supplied to each bucket as it passes the spout, it would have been retained for 10\u00b0 more of a revolution, and the loss of fall would have been only about 1/10th.\n\nThese observations serve to show, in general, that an advantage is gained by having the buckets so capacious that the quantity of water which each can receive as it passes the spout may not nearly fill it. This may be accomplished by making them of a sufficient length, that is, by making the wheel sufficiently broad between the two throodings. Economy is the only objection to this practice, and it is generally very ill placed. When the work to be performed by the wheel is great, the addition of power gained by a greater breadth will soon compensate for the additional expense.\n\nThe third plane CD is not very frequent; and millwrights generally content themselves with continuing the board all the way from the elbow B to the outer edge of the wheel at H; and AB is generally no more than one-third of the depth AI. But CD is a very evident improvement, causing the wheel to retain a very sensible addition to the water. Some indeed make this addition more considerable, by bringing BC more outward, so as to meet the rim of the wheel at H, for instance, and making HD coincide with the rim. But this makes the entry of the water somewhat more difficult during the very short time that the opening of the bucket passes the spout. To facilitate this as much as possible, the water should get a direction from the spout, such as will send it into the buckets in the most perfect manner. This may be obtained by delivering the water through an aperture that is divided by thin plates of board or metal, placed in the proper position, as we have represented in fig. 6. The form of bucket last mentioned, having the wreft concentric with the rim, is unfavourable to the ready admittance of the water; whereas an oblique wreft conducts the water which has missed one bucket into the next below.\n\nThe mechanical consideration of this subject also shows us, that a deep throading, in order to make a capacious bucket,\nbucket, is not a good method: it does not make the buckets retain their water any longer; and it diminishes the effective fall of water: for the water received at the top of the wheel immediately falls to the bottom of the bucket, and thus shortens the fictitious pillar of water, which we showed to be the measure of the effective or useful pressure on the wheel: and this concurs with our former reasons for recommending as great a breadth of the wheel, and length of buckets, as economical considerations will permit.\n\nA bucket wheel was some time ago executed by Mr Robert Burns, at the cotton mills of Houlton, Burns, and Co. at Cartfide in Renfrewshire, of a construction entirely new, but founded on a good principle, which is susceptible of great extension. It is represented in fig. 8. The bucket consists of a flut AB, an arm BC, and a well CD, concentric with the rim. But the bucket is also divided by a partition LM, concentric with the sole and rim, and so placed as to make the inner and outer portions of nearly equal capacity. It is evident, without any farther reasoning about it, that this partition will enable the bucket to retain its water much longer. When they are filled one-third, they retain the whole water at 18\u00b0 from the bottom; and they retain one half at 11\u00b0. They do not admit the water quite so freely as buckets of the common construction; but by means of the contrivance mentioned a little ago for the spout (after the invention of Mr Burns, and furnished with a rack-work, which raised or depressed it as the supply of water varied, so as at all times to employ the whole fall of the water), it is found, that a slow-moving wheel allows one-half of the water to get into the inner buckets, especially if the partition do not altogether reach the radius drawn through the lip D of the outer bucket.\n\nThis is a very great improvement of the bucket wheel; and when the wheel is made of a liberal breadth, so that the water may be very shallow in the buckets, it seems to carry the performance as far as it can go. Mr Burns made the first trial on a wheel of 24 feet diameter; and its performance is manifestly superior to that of the wheel which it replaced, and which was a very good one. It has also another valuable property: When the supply of water is very scanty, a proper adjustment of the apparatus in the spout will direct almost the whole of the water into the outer buckets; which, by placing it at a greater distance from the axis, makes a very sensible addition to its mechanical energy.\n\nWe said that this principle is susceptible of considerable extension; and it is evident that two partitions will increase the effect, and that it will increase with the number of partitions: so that when the practice now begun, of making water-wheels of iron, shall become general, and therefore very thin partitions are used, their number may be greatly increased without any inconvenience: and it is obvious, that this series of partitions must greatly contribute to the stiffness and general firmness of the whole wheel.\n\nThere frequently occurs a difficulty in the making of bucket wheels, when the half-taught mill-wright attempts to retain the water a long time in the buckets. The water gets into them with a difficulty which he cannot account for, and spills all about, even when the buckets are not moving away from the spout. This arises from the air, which must find its way out to admit the water, but is obstructed by the entering water, and occasions a great spluttering at the entry. This may be entirely prevented by making the spout considerably narrower than the wheel. This will leave room at the two ends of the buckets for the escape of the air. This obstruction is vastly greater than one would imagine: for the water drags along with it a great quantity of air, as is evident in the Water-blast described by many authors.\n\nThere is another and very serious obstruction to the motion of an overshot or bucketed wheel. When it moves in back water, it is not only resisted by the water, when it moves more slowly than the wheel, which is very frequently the case, but it lifts a great deal in the rising buckets. In some particular states of back water, the descending bucket fills itself completely with water; and, in other cases, it contains a very considerable quantity, and air of common density; while in some rarer cases it contains less water, with air in a condensed state. In the first case, the rising bucket must come up filled with water, which it cannot drop till its mouth gets out of the water. In the second case, part of the water goes out before this; but the air rarefies, and therefore there is still some water dragged or lifted up by the wheel, by suction as it is usually called. In the last case there is no such back load on the rising side of the wheel, but (which is as detrimental to its performance) the descending side is employed in condensing air; and although this air aids the ascent of the rising side, it does not aid it so much as it impedes the descending side, being (by the form of the bucket) nearer to the vertical line drawn through the axis.\n\nAll this may be completely prevented by a few holes made in the flut of each bucket. Air being at least 800 times rarer than water, will escape through a hole almost 30 times faster with the same pressure. Very moderate holes will therefore suffice for this purpose: and the small quantity of water which these holes discharge during the descent of the buckets, produces a loss which is altogether insignificant. The water which runs out of one runs into another, so that there is only the loss of one bucket. We have seen a wheel of only 14 feet diameter working in nearly three feet of back water. It laboured prodigiously, and brought up a great load of water, which fell from it in abrupt dashes, which rendered the motion very hobbling. When three holes of an inch diameter were made in each bucket (12 feet long), the wheel laboured no more, there was no more plunging of water from its rising side, and its power on the machinery was increased more than one-fourth.\n\nThese practical observations may contain information that is new even to several experienced millwrights. To persons less informed they cannot fail of being useful. We now proceed to consider the action of water thus lying in the buckets of a wheel; and to ascertain its energy as it may be modified by different circumstances of fall, velocity, &c.\n\nWith respect to variations in the fall, there can be little room for discussion. Since the active pressure is measured by the pillar of water reaching from the horizontal plane where it is delivered on the wheel, to the horizontal plane where it is spilled by the wheel, it is evident that it must be proportional to this pillar, and therefore we must deliver it as high and retain it as long as possible.\n\nThis maxim obliges us, in the first place, to use a wheel\nwheel whose diameter is equal to the whole fall. We shall not gain anything by employing a larger wheel; for although we should gain by using only that part of the circumference where the weight will act more perpendicularly to the radius, we shall lose more by the necessity of discharging the water at a greater height from the bottom: For we must suppose the buckets of both wheels equally constructed; in which case, the heights above the bottom, where they will discharge the water, will increase in the proportion of the diameter of the wheel. Now, that we shall lose more by this than we gain by a more direct application of the weight, is plain, without any further reasoning, by taking the extreme case, and supposing our wheel enlarged to such a size, that the useful part below is equal to our whole fall. In this case the water will be spilled from the buckets as soon as it is delivered into them. All intermediate cases, therefore, partake of the imperfection of this.\n\nWhen our fall is exceedingly great, a wheel of an equal diameter becomes enormously big and expensive, and is of itself an unmanageable load. We have seen wheels of 38 feet diameter, however, which worked extremely well; but they are of very difficult construction, and extremely apt to warp and go out of shape by their weight. In cases like this, where we are unwilling to lose any part of the force of a small stream, the belt form of a bucket wheel is an inverted chain pump. Instead of employing a chain pump of the best construction, ABCDEA (fig. 9.) to raise water through the upright pipe CB, by means of a force applied to the upper wheel A, let the water be delivered from a spout F, into the upper part of the pipe BC, and it will press down the plugs in the lower and narrower bored part of it with the full weight of the column, and escape at the dead level of C. This weight will urge round the wheel A without any deflection: and this is the most powerful manner that any fall of water whatever can be applied, and exceeds the most perfect overshot wheel. But though it excels all chains of buckets in economy and in effect, it has all the other imperfections of this kind of machinery. Though the chain of plugs be of great strength, it has so much motion in its joints that it needs frequent repairs; and when it breaks, it is generally in the neighbourhood of A, on the loaded side, and all comes down with great a crash. There is also a loss of power by the immersion of so many plugs and chains in the water; for there can be no doubt but that if the plugs were big enough and light enough, they would buoy and even draw up the plugs in the narrow part at C. They must therefore diminish, in all other cases, the force with which this plug is pressed down.\n\nThe velocity of an overshot wheel is a matter of very great nicety; and authors, both speculative and practical, have entertained different, nay opposite, opinions on the subject. Mr Belidor, whom the engineers of Europe have long been accustomed to regard as sacred authority, maintains, that there is a certain velocity related to that obtainable by the whole fall, which will procure to an overshot wheel the greatest performance. Desaguliers, Smeaton, Lambert, De Parcieux, and others, maintain, that there is no such relation, and that the performance of an overshot wheel will be the greater, as it moves more slowly by an increase of its load of work. Belidor maintains, that the active power of water lying in a bucket wheel of any diameter is equal to that of the impulse of the same water on the floats of an undershot wheel, when the water issues from a sluice in the bottom of the dam. The other writers whom we have named assert, that the energy of an undershot wheel is but one half of that of an overshot, actuated by the same quantity of water falling from the same height.\n\nTo a manufacturing country like ours, which derives allodium superiority, by which it more than compensates for the impediments of heavy taxes and luxurious living, chiefly from its machinery, in which it leaves all Europe far behind, the decision of this question, in such a manner as shall leave no doubt or misconception in the mind even of an unlettered artist, must be considered as a material service; and we think that this is easily attainable.\n\nWhen any machine moves uniformly, the accelerating force or pressure actually exerted on the impelled point of the machine is in equilibrio with all the resistances which are exerted at the working point, with those arising from friction, and those that are excited in different parts of the machine by their mutual actions. This is an incontrovertible truth; and though little attended to by the mechanicians, is the foundation of all practical knowledge of machines. Therefore, when an overshot wheel moves uniformly, with any velocity whatever, the water is acting with its whole weight: for gravity would accelerate its descent, if not completely balanced by some reaction; and in this balance gravity and the resisting part of the machine exert equal and opposite pressures, and thus produce the uniform motion of the machine. We are thus particular on this point, because we observe mechanicians of the first name employing a mode of reasoning on the question now before us which is specious, and appears to prove the conclusion which they draw; but is nevertheless contrary to true mechanical principles. They assert, that the slower a heavy body is descending (suppose in a scale suspended from an axis in peritrochoid), the more does it press on the scale, and the more does it urge the machine round: and therefore the slower an overshot wheel turns, the greater is the force with which the water urges it round, and the more work will be done. It is very true that the machine is more forcibly impelled, and that more work is done: but this is not because a pound of water presses more strongly, but because there is more water pressing on the wheel; for the spout supplies at the same rate, and each bucket receives more water as it passes by it.\n\nLet us therefore examine this point by the unquestionable principles of mechanics.\n\nLet the overshot wheel AFH (fig. 5.) receive the water from a spout at the very top of the wheel; and, in order that the wheel may not be retarded by dragging into motion the water simply laid into the uppermost bucket at A, let it be received at B, with the velocity (directed in a tangent to the wheel) acquired by the head of water AP. This velocity, therefore, must be equal to that of the rim of the wheel. Let this be v, or let the wheel and the water move over v inches in a second. Let the buckets be of such dimensions, that all the water which each receives as it passes the spout is retained till it comes to the position R, where it is discharged at once. It is plain that, in place of the separate quantities of water lying in each bucket, we may substitute a continued ring of water, equal to their sum,\nsum, and uniformly distributed in the space BER \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). This constitutes a ring of uniform thickness. Let the area of its cross-section \\( \\beta B \\) or \\( F F' \\) be called \\( a \\). We have already demonstrated that the mechanical energy with which this water on the circumference of the wheel urges it round, is the same with what would be exerted by the pillar \\( b r b \\) pressing on \\( F F' \\), or acting by the lever \\( C F \\). The weight of this pillar may be expressed by \\( a \\times b r \\), or \\( a \\times PS \\); and if we call the radius \\( CF \\) of the wheel \\( R \\), the momentum or mechanical energy of this weight will be represented by \\( a \\times PS \\times R \\).\n\nNow, let us suppose that this wheel is employed to raise a weight \\( W \\), which is suspended by a rope wound round the axis of the wheel. Let \\( r \\) be the radius of this axle. Then \\( W \\times r \\) is the momentum of the work. Let the weight rise with the velocity \\( u \\) when the rim of the wheel turns with the velocity \\( v \\), that is, let it rise \\( u \\) inches in a second.\n\nSince a perfect equilibrium obtains between the power and the work when the motion is uniform, we must have \\( W \\times r = a \\times PS \\times R \\). But it is evident that \\( R : r = v : u \\). Therefore \\( W \\times u = a \\times v \\times PS \\).\n\nNow the performance of the machine is undoubtedly measured by the weight and the height to which it is raised in a second, or by \\( W \\times u \\). Therefore the machine is in its best possible state when \\( a \\times v \\times PS \\) is a maximum. But it is plain that \\( a \\times v \\) is an invariable quantity; for it is the cubic inches of water which the spout supplies in a second. If the wheel moves fast, little water lies in each bucket, and \\( a \\) is small. When \\( v \\) is small, \\( a \\) is great, for the opposite reason; but \\( a \\times v \\) remains the same. Therefore we must make \\( PS \\) a maximum, that is, we must deliver the water as high up as possible. But this diminishes \\( AP \\), and this diminishes the velocity of the wheel; and as this has no limit, the proposition is demonstrated; and an overhot wheel does the more work as it moves slower.\n\nConvincing as this discussion must be to any mechanician, we are anxious to impress the same maxim on the minds of practical men, unaccustomed to mathematical reasoning of any kind. We therefore beg indulgence for adding a popular view of the question, which requires no such investigation.\n\nWe may reason in this way: Suppose a wheel having 30 buckets, and that six cubic feet of water are delivered in a second on the top of a wheel, and discharged without any loss by the way at a certain height from the bottom of the wheel. Let this be the case, whatever is the rate of the wheel's motion; the buckets being of a sufficient capacity to hold all the water which falls into them. Let this wheel be employed to raise a weight of any kind, suppose water in a chain of 30 buckets, to the same height, and with the same velocity. Suppose, farther, that when the load on the rising side of the machine is one half of that on the wheel, the wheel makes four turns in a minute, or one turn in 15 seconds. During this time 90 cubic feet of water have flowed into the 30 buckets, and each has received three cubic feet. Then each of the rising buckets contains \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) feet; and 45 cubic feet are delivered into the upper cistern during one turn of the wheel, and 180 cubic feet in one minute.\n\nNow, suppose the machine so loaded, by making the rising buckets more capacious, that it makes only two turns in a minute, or one turn in 30 seconds. Then each descending bucket must contain six cubic feet of water. If each bucket of the rising tide contained three cubic feet, the motion of the machine would be the same as before. This is a point which no mechanician will controvert. When two pounds are suspended to one end of a string which passes over the pulley, and one pound to the other end, the descent of the two pound will be the same with that of a four pounds weight, which is employed in the same manner to draw up two pounds. Our machine would therefore continue to make four turns in the minute, and would deliver 90 cubic feet during each turn, and 360 in a minute. But, by supposition, it is making but two turns in a minute; this must proceed from a greater load than three cubic feet of water in each rising bucket. The machine must therefore be raising more than 90 feet of water during one turn of the wheel, and more than 180 in the minute.\n\nThus it appears, that if the machine be turning twice as slow as before, there is more than twice the former quantity in the rising buckets, and more will be raised in a minute by the same expenditure of power. In like manner, if the machine go three times as slow, there must be more than three times the former quantity of water in the rising buckets, and more work will be done.\n\nBut we may go farther, and assert, that the more we retard the machine, by loading it with more work of a similar kind, the greater will be its performance. This does not immediately appear from the present discussion: But let us call the first quantity of water in the rising bucket \\( A \\); the water raised by four turns in a minute will be \\( 4 \\times 30 \\times A = 120A \\). The quantity in this bucket, when the machine goes twice as slow, has been shown to be greater than \\( 2A \\) (call it \\( 2A + x \\)); the water raised by two turns in a minute will be \\( 2 \\times 30 \\times 2A + x = 120A + 60x \\). Now, let the machine go four times as slow, making but one turn in a minute, the rising bucket must now contain more than twice \\( 2A + x \\), or more than \\( 4A + 2x \\); call it \\( 4A + 2x + y \\). The work done by one turn in a minute will now be \\( 30 \\times 4A + 2x + y = 120A + 60x + 30y \\).\n\nBy such an induction of the work, done with any rates of motion we choose, it is evident that the performance of the machine increases with every diminution of its velocity that is produced by the mere addition of a similar load of work, or that it does the more work the slower it goes.\n\nWe have supposed the machine to be in its state of permanent uniform motion. If we consider it only in the beginning of its motion, the result is still more in favour of slow motion: For, at the first action of the moving power, the inertia of the machine itself consumes part of it, and it acquires its permanent speed by degrees; during which, the resistances arising from the work, friction, &c., increase, till they exactly balance the pressure of the water; and after this the machine accelerates no more. Now the greater the power and the resistance arising from the work are, in proportion to the inertia of the machine, the sooner will all arrive at its state of permanent velocity.\n\nThere is another circumstance which impairs the performance of an overhot wheel moving with a great velocity, viz., the effects of the centrifugal force on the water.\nwater in the buckets. Our mill-wrights know well enough, that too great velocity will throw the water out of the buckets; but few, if any, know exactly the diminution of power produced by this cause. The following very simple construction will determine this:\n\nLet AOB (fig. 10.) be an overshot wheel, of which AB' is the upright diameter, and C is the centre. Make CF the length of a pendulum, which will make two vibrations during one turn of the wheel. Draw FE to the elbow of any of the buckets. The water in this bucket, instead of having its surface horizontal, as NO, will have it in the direction NO perpendicular to FE very nearly.\n\nFor the time of falling along half of FC is to that of two vibrations of this pendulum, or to the time of a revolution of the wheel, as the radius of a circle is to its circumference; and it is well known, that the time of moving along half of AC, by the uniform action of the centrifugal force, is to that of a revolution as the radius of a circle to its circumference. Therefore the time of describing one half of AC by the centrifugal force, is equal to the time of describing one half of FC by gravity. These spaces, being similarly described in equal times, are proportional to the accelerating forces. Therefore \\( \\frac{1}{2} FC : \\frac{1}{2} AC, \\) or \\( FC : AC = \\text{gravity} : \\text{centrifugal force}. \\)\n\nComplete the parallelogram FCEK. A particle at E is urged by its weight in the direction KE, with a force which may be expressed by FC or KE; and it is urged by the centrifugal force in the direction CE, with a force = AC or CE. By their combined action it is urged in the direction FE. Therefore, as the surface of standing water is always at right angles to the action of gravity, that is, to the plumb-line, so the surface of the water in the revolving bucket is perpendicular to the action of the combined force FE.\n\nLet NEO be the position of the bucket, which just holds all the water which it received as it passed the spout when not affected by the centrifugal force; and let NDO be its position when it would be empty. Let the vertical lines through D and E cut the circle described round C with the radius CF in the points H and I. Draw HC, IC, cutting the circle AOB in L and M. Make the arch d' equal to AL, and the arch e' equal to AM: Then C and C will be the positions of the bucket on the revolving wheel, corresponding to CDO and CEO on the wheel at rest. Water will begin to run out at e', and it will be all gone at d'.\u2014The demonstration is evident.\n\nThe force which now urges the wheel is still the weight really in the buckets: For though the water be urged in the direction and with the force FE, one of its constituents, CE, has no tendency to impel the wheel; and KE is the only impelling force.\n\nIt is but of late years that mills have been constructed or attended to with that accuracy and scientific skill which are necessary for deducing confidential conclusions from any experiments that can be made with them; and it is therefore no matter of wonder that the opinions of mill-wrights have been so different on this subject. There is a natural wish to see a machine moving briskly; it has the appearance of activity: but a very slow motion always looks as if the machine were overloaded. For this reason mill-wrights have always yielded slowly, and with some reluctance, to the repeated advices of the mathematicians: but they have yielded; and we see them adopting maxims of construction more agreeable to found theory; making their wheels of great breadth, and loading them with a great deal of work. Mr Euler says, that the performance of the belt mill cannot exceed that of the worst above 3th: but we have seen a stream of water completely expended in driving a small flax mill, which now drives a cotton mill of 4000 spindles, with all its carding, roving, and drawing machinery, besides the lathes and other engines of the smith and carpenters workshops, exerting a force not less than ten times what sufficed for the flax mill.\n\nThe above discussion only demonstrates in general the advantage of slow motion; but does not point out in any degree the relation between the rate of motion and the work performed, nor even the principles on which it depends. Yet this is a subject fit for a mathematical investigation; and we would prosecute it in this place, if it were necessary for the improvement of practical mechanics. But we have seen that there is not, in the nature of things, a maximum of performance attached to any particular rate of motion which should therefore be preferred. For this reason we omit this discussion of mere speculative curiosity. It is very intricate: For we must not now express the pressure on the wheel by a constant pillar of water incumbent on the extremity of the horizontal arm, as we did before when we supposed the buckets completely filled; nor by a smaller constant pillar, corresponding to a smaller but equal quantity lying in every bucket. Each different velocity puts a different quantity of water into the bucket as it passes the spout; and this occasions a difference in the place where the discharge is begun and completed. This circumstance is some obstacle to the advantages of very slow motions, because it brings on the discharge sooner.\n\nAll this may indeed be expressed by a simple equation of easy management; but the whole process of the mechanical discussion is both intricate and tedious, and the results are so much diversified by the forms of the buckets, that they do not afford any rule of sufficient generality to reward our trouble. The curious reader may see a very full investigation of this subject in two dissertations by Elvius in the Swedish Transactions, and in the Hydrodynamique of Professor Karlfner of Gottingen; who has abridged these dissertations of Elvius, and considerably improved the whole investigation, and has added some comparisons of his deductions with the actual performance of some great works. These comparisons, however, are not very satisfactory. There is also a valuable paper on this subject by Mr Lambert, in the Memoirs of the Academy of Berlin for the year 1775. From these dissertations, and from the Hydrodynamique of the abbe Bofluit, the reader will get all that theory can teach of the relation between the pressures of the power and work on the machine and the rates of its motion. The practical reader may rely with confidence on the simple demonstration we have given, that the performance is improved by diminishing the velocity.\n\nAll we have to do, therefore, is to load the machine, and thus to diminish its speed, unless other physical circumstances throw obstacles in the way: but there are such obstacles. In all machines there are little inequalities of action that are unavoidable. In the action of a wheel and pinion, though made with the utmost judgment and care, there are such inequalities. These increase\ncrease by the changes of form occasioned by the wearing of the machine\u2014much greater irregularities arise from the sublatory motions of cranks, tampers, and other parts which move unequally or reciprocally. A machine may be so loaded as just to be in equilibrium with its work, in the favourable position of its parts. When this changes into one less favourable, the machine may stop; if not, it at least staggers, hobbles, or works unequally. The rubbing parts bear long on each other, with enormous prelusions, and cut deep, and increase friction. Such slow motions must therefore be avoided.\n\nA little more velocity enables the machine to get over those increased resistances by its inertia, or the great quantity of motion inherent in it. Great machines possess this advantage in a superior degree, and will therefore work steadily with a smaller velocity. These circumstances are hardly susceptible of mathematical dilution, and our best reliance is on well directed experience.\n\nFor this purpose, the reader will do well to peruse with care the excellent paper by Mr Smeaton in the Philosophical Transactions for 1759. This dissertation contains a numerous list of experiments, most judiciously contrived by him, and executed with the accuracy and attention to the most important circumstances, which is to be observed in all that gentleman's performances.\n\nIt is true, these experiments were made with small models; and we must not, without great caution, transfer the results of such experiments to large works. But we may safely transfer the laws of variation which result from a variation of circumstances, although we must not adopt the absolute quantities of the variations themselves. Mr Smeaton was fully aware of the limitations to which conclusions drawn from experiments on models are subject, and has made the applications with his usual sagacity.\n\nHis general inference is, that, in smaller works, the rim of the overhot-wheel should not have a greater velocity than three feet in a second; but that larger mills may be allowed a greater velocity than this. When every thing is executed in the best manner, he says that the work performed will amount to fully two-thirds of the power expended; that is, that three cubic feet of water descending from any height will raise two to the same height.\n\nIt is not very easy to compare these deductions with observations on large works; because there are few cases where we have good measures of the resistances opposed by the work performed by the machine. Mills employed for pumping water afford the best opportunities. But the inertia of their working gear diminishes their useful performance very sensibly; because their great beams, pump-rods, &c., have a reciprocating motion, which must be destroyed, and produced anew in every stroke. We have examined some machines of this kind which are esteemed good ones; and we find few of them whose performance exceeds one half of the power expended.\n\nBy comparing other mills with these, we get the best information of their resistances. The comparison with mills worked by Watt and Boulton's steam-engines is perhaps a better measure of the resistances opposed by different kinds of work, because their power is very distinctly known. We have been informed by one of the most eminent engineers, that a ton and a half of water per minute falling one foot will grind and dress one bushel of wheat per hour. This is equivalent to nine tons falling ten feet.\n\nIf an overhot-wheel opposed no resistance, and only one bucket were filled, the wheel would acquire the velocity due to a fall through the whole height. But when it is in this state of accelerated motion, if another bucket of water is delivered into it, its motion must be checked at the first, by the necessity of dragging forward this water. If the buckets fill in succession as they pass the spout, the velocity acquired by an unrelenting wheel is but half of that which one bucket would give. In all cases, therefore, the velocity is diminished by the inertia of the entering water when it is simply laid into the upper buckets. The performance will therefore be improved by delivering the water on the wheel with that velocity with which the wheel is really moving. And as we cannot give the direction of a tangent to the wheel, the velocity with which it is delivered on the wheel shall be so much greater than the intended velocity of the rim, that it shall be precisely equal to it when it is eliminated in the direction of the tangent. Three or four inches of fall are sufficient for this purpose; and it should never be neglected, for it has a very sensible influence on the performance. But it is highly improper to give it more than this, with the view of impelling the wheel by its stroke. For even although it were proper to employ part of the fall in this way (which we shall presently see to be very improper), we cannot procure this impulse; because the water falls among other water, or it strikes the boards of the wheel with such obliquity that it cannot produce any such effect.\n\nIt is a much debated question among millwrights, whether the diameter of the wheel should be such as that the water will be delivered at the top of the wheel, or larger, so that the water is received at some distance from the top, where it will act more perpendicularly to the arm? We apprehend that the observations formerly made will decide in favour of the first practice. The space below, where the water is discharged from the wheel, being proportional to the diameter of the wheel, there is an undoubted loss of fall attending a large wheel; and this is not compensated by delivering the water at a greater distance from the perpendicular. We should therefore recommend the use of the whole descending side, and make the diameter of the wheel no greater than the fall, till it is so much reduced that the centrifugal force begins to produce a sensible effect. Since the rim can hardly have a smaller velocity than three feet per second, it is evident that a small wheel must revolve more rapidly. This made it proper to infer the determination that we have given, of the loss of power produced by the centrifugal force. But even with this in view, we should employ much smaller wheels than are generally done on small falls. Indeed the loss of water at the bottom may be diminished, by nicely fitting the arch which surrounds the wheel, so as not to allow the water to escape by the sides or bottom. While this improvement remains in good order, and the wheel entire, it produces a very sensible effect; but the passage widens continually by the wearing of the wheel. A bit of stick or stone falling in about the wheel tears off part of the throbbing or bucket, and frothy weather frequently binds all fast. It therefore seldom answers expectations. We have nothing to add on this case.\nto what we have already extracted from Mr Smeaton's Dissertation on the Subject of Bread or half Overflot Wheels.\n\nThere is another form of wheel by which water is made to act on a machine by its weight, which merits consideration. This is known in this country by the name of Barker's mill, and has been described by Defaguliers, vol. ii. p. 460. It consists of an upright pipe or trunk AB (fig. 11.), communicating with two horizontal branches BC, Bc, which have a hole C c near their ends, opening in opposite directions, at right angles to their lengths. Suppose water to be poured in at the top from the spout F, it will run out by the holes C and c with the velocity corresponding to the depth of these holes under the surface. The consequence of this must be, that the arms will be pressed backwards; for there is no solid surface at the hole C, on which the lateral pressure of the water can be exerted, while it acts with its full force on the opposite side of the arm. This unbalanced pressure is equal to the weight of a column having the orifice for its base, and twice the depth under the surface of the water in the trunk for its height. This measure of the height may seem odd, because if the orifice were shut, the pressure on it is the weight of a column reaching from the surface. But when it is open, the water issues with nearly the velocity acquired by falling from the surface, and the quantity of motion produced is that of a column of twice this length, moving with this velocity. This is actually produced by the pressure of the fluid, and must therefore be accompanied by an equal reaction.\n\nNow suppose this apparatus set on the pivot E, and to have a spindle AD above the trunk, furnished with a cylindrical bobbin D, having a rope wound round it, and passing over a pulley G. A weight W may be suspended there, which may balance this backward pressure. If the weight be too small for this purpose, the retrograde motion of the arms will wind up the cord, and raise the weight; and thus we obtain an acting machine, employing the pressure of the water, and applicable to any purpose. A runner millstone may be put on the top of the spindle; and we should then produce a flour mill of the utmost simplicity, having neither wheel nor pinion, and subject to hardly any wear. It is somewhat surprising, that although this was invented at the beginning of this century, and appears to have such advantage in point of simplicity, it has not come into use. So little has Dr Defaguliers's account been attended to (although it is mentioned by him as an excellent machine, and as highly instructive to the hydraulic), that the same invention was again brought forward by a German professor (Segner) as his own, and has been honoured by a series of elaborate disquisitions concerning its theory and performance by Euler and by John Bernoulli. Euler's Dissertations are to be found in the Memoirs of the Academy of Berlin, 1751, &c., and in the Nov. Comment. Petropol. tom. vi. Bernoulli's are at the end of his Hydraulics. Both these authors agree in saying, that this machine excels all other methods of employing the force of water. Simple as it appears, its true theory, and the best form of construction, are most abstruse and delicate subjects; and it is not easy to give such an account of its principles as will be understood by an ordinary reader.\n\nWe see, in general, that the machine must press backwards; and little investigation suffices for understanding the intensity of this pressure, when the machine is at rest. But when it is allowed to run backwards, withdrawing itself from the pressure, the intensity of it is diminished; and if no other circumstances intervened, it might not be difficult to lay what particular pressure corresponded to any rate of motion. Accordingly, Defaguliers, presuming on the simplicity of the machine, affirms the pressure to be the weight of a column, which would produce a velocity of efflux equal to the difference of the velocity of the fluid and of the machine; and hence he deduces, that its performance will be the greatest possible, when its retrograde velocity is one-third of the velocity acquired by falling from the surface, in which case, it will raise $\\frac{3}{4}$ths of the water expended to the same height, which is double of the performance of a mill acted on by the impulse of water.\n\nBut this is a very imperfect account of the operation. When the machine (constructed exactly as we have described) moves round, the water which issues defecates in the vertical trunk, and then, moving along the horizontal arms, partakes of this circular motion. This excites a centrifugal force, which is exerted against the ends of the arms by the intervention of the fluid. The whole fluid is subjected to this pressure (increasing for every section across the arm in the proportion of its distance from the axis), and every particle is pressed with the accumulated centrifugal forces of all the sections that are nearer to the axis. Every section therefore sustains an actual pressure proportional to the square of its distance from the axis. This increases the velocity of efflux, and this increases the velocity of revolution; and this mutual co-operation would seem to terminate in an infinite velocity of both motions. But, on the other hand, this circular motion must be given anew to every particle of water as it enters the horizontal arm. This can be done only by the motion already in the arm, and at its expense. Thus there must be a velocity which cannot be overpassed even by an unloaded machine. But it is also plain, that by making the horizontal arm very capacious, the motion of the water from the axis to the jet may be made very slow, and much of this diminution of circular motion prevented. Accordingly, Euler has recommended a form by which this is done in the most eminent degree. His machine consists of a hollow conoidal ring, of which fig. 12. is a section. The part AH h a is a sort of a funnel basin, which receives the water from the spout F; not in the direction pointing towards the axis, but in the direction, and with the precise velocity, of its motion. This prevents any retardation by dragging forward the water. The water then passes down between the outer conoid AC ca and the inner conoid HG g h along spiral channels formed by partitions soldered to both conoids. The curves of these channels are determined by a theory which aims at the annihilation of all unnecessary and improper motions of the water, but which is too abstruse to find a place here. The water thus conducted arrives at the bottom CG, c g. On the the outer circumference of this bottom are arranged a number of spouts (one for each channel), which are all directed one way in tangents to the circumference.\n\nAdopting the common theory of the reaction of fluids, this should be a very powerful machine, and should raise $\\frac{3}{4}$ths of the water expended. But if we admit the reaction...\naction to be equal to the force of the issuing fluid (and we do not see how this can be refused), the machine must be nearly twice as powerful. We therefore repeat our wonder, that it has not been brought into use. But it appears that no trial has been made even of a model; so that we have no experiments to encourage an engineer to repeat the trial. Even the late author, Professor Segner, has not related any thing of this kind in his *Exercitationes Hydraulicae*, where he particularly describes the machine. This remissness probably has proceeded from fixing the attention on Euler's improved construction. It is plain that this must be a most cumbrous mass, even in a small size requiring a prodigious vessel, and carrying an unwieldy load. If we examine the theory which recommends this construction, we find that the advantages, though real and sensible, bear but a small proportion to the whole performance of the simple machine as invented by Dr Barker. It is therefore to be regretted, that engineers have not attempted to realize the first project. We beg leave to recommend it, with an additional argument taken from an addition made to it by Mr Mathon de la Cour, in Rozier's *Journal de Physique*, January and August 1775.\n\nThis gentleman brings down a large pipe FEH (fig. 13.) from a reservoir, bends it upward at H, and introduces it into two horizontal arms DA, DB, which have an upright spindle DK, carrying a millstone in the style of Dr Barker's mill. The ingenious mechanician will have no difficulty of contriving a method of joining these pipes, so as to permit a free circular motion without losing much water. The operation of the machine in this form is evident. The water, pressed by the column FG, flows out at the holes A and B, and the unbalanced pressure on the opposite sides of the arms forces them round. The compendiousness and other advantages of this construction are most striking, allowing us to make use of the greatest fall without any increase of the size of the machine. It undoubtedly enables us to employ a stream of water too scanty to be employed in any other form. The author gives the dimensions of an engine which he had seen at Bourg Argental. AB is 92 inches, and its diameter 3 inches; the diameter of each orifice is 1\u00bd; FG is 21 feet; the pipe D was fitted into C by grinding; and the internal diameter of D is 2 inches.\n\nWhen the machine was performing no work, or was unloaded, and emitted water by one hole only, it made 415 turns in a minute. This gives a velocity of 46 feet per second for the hole. This is a curious fact: For the water would issue from this hole at rest with the velocity of 37\u00bd. This great velocity (which was much less than the velocity with which the water actually quitted the pipe) was undoubtedly produced by the prodigious centrifugal force, which was nearly 17 times the weight of the water in the orifice.\n\nThe empty machine weighed 80 pounds, and its weight was half-supported by the upper pressure of the water, so that the friction of the pivots was much diminished. It is a pity that the author has given no account of any work done by the machine. Indeed it was only working ventilators for a large hall. His theory by no means embraces all its principles, nor is it well-founded.\n\nWe think that the free motion round the neck of the feeding-pipe, without any loss of water or any considerable friction, may be obtained in the following manner: AB (fig. 14.) represents a portion of the revolving horizontal pipe, and CE etc part of the feeding pipe. The neck of the first is turned truly cylindrical, so as to turn easily, but without thake, in the collar C of the feeding-pipe, and each has a shoulder which may support the other. That the friction of this joint may not be great, and the pipes destroy each other by wearing, the horizontal pipe has an iron spindle EF, fixed exactly in the axis of the joint, and resting with its pivot F in a slot of hard steel, fixed to the iron bar GH, which goes across the feeding-pipe, and is firmly supported in it. This pipe is made bell-shaped, widening below. A collar or hole of thin leather is fitted to the inside of this pipe, and is represented (in section) by LKM m k l. This is kept in its place by means of a metal or wooden ring N n, thin at the upper edge, and taper shaped. This is drawn in above the leather, and stretches it, and causes it to apply to the side of the pipe all around. There can be no leakage at this joint, because the water will press the leather to the smooth metal pipe; nor can there be any sensible friction, because the water gets at the edge of the leather, and the whole unbalanced pressure is at the small crevice, between the two metal shoulders. These shoulders need not touch, so that the friction must be insensible. We imagine that this method of tightening a turning joint may be used with great advantage in many cases.\n\nWe have only further to observe on this engine, that any imperfection by which the passage of the water is diminished or obstructed produces a saving of water which is in exact proportion to the diminution of effect. The only inaccuracy that is not thus compensated is when the jets are not at right angles to the arms.\n\nWe repeat our wishes, that engineers would endeavour to bring this machine into use, seeing many situations where it may be employed to great advantage. Suppose, for instance, a small supply of water from a great height applied in this manner to a centrifugal pump, or to a hair belt passing over a pulley, and dipping in the water of a deep well. This would be a hydraulic machine exceeding all others in simplicity and durability, though inferior in effect to some other constructions.\n\n2. Of Underflot Wheels.\n\nAll wheels go by this name where the motion of the water is quicker than that of the partitions or boards of the wheel, and it therefore impels them. These are called the float-boards, or floats, of an underflot wheel. The water, running in a mill-row, with a velocity derived from a head of water, or from a declivity of channel, strikes on these floats, and occasions, by its deflections sidewise and upwards, a pressure on the floats sufficient for impelling the wheel.\n\nThere are few points of practical mechanics that have been more considered than the action of water on the floats of a wheel; hardly a book of mechanics being silent on the subject. But the generality of them, at least such as are intelligible to persons who are not very much conversant in dynamical and mathematical discussion, have hardly done anything more than copied the earliest deductions from the simple theory of the resistance of fluids. The consequence has been, that our practical knowledge is very imperfect; and it is still chiefly\nchiefly from experience that we must learn the performance of underhot wheels. Unfortunately this stops their improvement; because those who have the only opportunities of making the experiments are not sufficiently acquainted with the principles of hydraulics, and are apt to ascribe differences in their performance to trifling novelties in their construction, or in the manner of applying the impulse of the water.\n\nWe have said so much on the imperfection of our theories of the impulse of fluids in the article RESISTANCE OF Fluids, that we need not repeat here the defects of the common explanations of the motions of underhot wheels. The part of this theory of the impulse of fluids which agrees best with observation is, that the impulse is in the duplicate proportion of the velocity with which the water strikes the float. That is, if \\( v \\) be the velocity of the stream, and \\( u \\) the velocity of the float, we shall have \\( F \\), the impulse on the float when held fast to its impulse \\( f \\) on the float moving with the velocity \\( u \\), as \\( v^2 \\) to \\( v-u^2 \\), and \\( f = F \\times \\frac{v-u^2}{v^2} \\).\n\nThis is the pressure acting on the float, and urging the wheel round its axis. The wheel must yield to this motion, if the resistance of the work does not exert a superior pressure on the float in the opposite direction. By yielding, the float withdraws from the impulse, and this is therefore diminished. The wheel accelerates, the resistances increase, and the impulses diminish, till they become an exact balance for the resistances. The motion now remains uniform, and the momentum of impulse is equal to that of resistance. The performance of the mill therefore is determined by this; and, whatever be the construction of the mill, its performance is best when the momentum of impulse is greatest. This is had by multiplying the pressure on the float by its velocity. Therefore the momentum will be expressed by\n\n\\[ F \\times \\frac{v-u^2}{v^2} \\times u. \\]\n\nBut since \\( F \\) and \\( v^2 \\) are constant quantities, the momentum will be proportional to \\( u \\times \\frac{v-u^2}{v^2} \\).\n\nLet \\( x \\) represent the relative velocity. Then \\( v-x \\) will be \\( u \\), and the momentum will be proportional to \\( v-x \\times x^2 \\), and will be a maximum when \\( v-x \\times x^2 \\) is a maximum, or when \\( v-x^3 \\) is a maximum. This will be discovered by making its fluxion \\( = 0 \\). That is,\n\n\\[ 2v \\times x - 3x^2 = 0. \\]\n\nand \\( 2v \\times x - 3x^2 = 0 \\)\n\nor \\( 2v = 3x \\), and \\( x = \\frac{2}{3}v \\); and therefore \\( v-x \\), or \\( u = \\frac{1}{3}v \\). That is, the velocity of the float must be one third of the velocity of the stream. It only remains to say what is the absolute pressure on the float thus circumstanced. Let the velocity \\( v \\) be supposed to arise from the pressure of a head of water \\( h \\). The common theory teaches that the impulse on a given surface \\( S \\) at rest is equal to the weight of a column \\( hS \\); put this in place of \\( F \\), and \\( \\frac{4}{9}v^3 \\) in place of \\( v-u^2 \\) and \\( \\frac{4}{9}v \\) for \\( u \\). This gives us \\( S \\times \\frac{4}{9}v^3 \\) for the momentum. Now the power expended is \\( S \\times \\frac{4}{9}v^3 \\), or the column \\( S \\times h \\) moving with the velocity \\( v \\). Therefore the greatest performance of an underhot wheel is equivalent to raising \\( \\frac{4}{9}v^3 \\) of the water that drives it to the same height.\n\nBut this is too small an estimation; for the pressure exerted on a plane surface, situated as the float of a mill-wheel, is considerably greater than the weight of the column \\( S.h \\). This is nearly the pressure on a surface wholly immersed in the fluid. But when a small vein strikes a larger plane, so as to be deflected on all sides in a thin sheet, the impulse is almost double of this. This is in some measure the case in a mill wheel. When the stream strikes it, it is heaped up along its face, and falls back again\u2014and during this motion it is acting with a hydrostatic pressure on it. When the wheel dips into an open river, this accumulation is less remarkable, because much escapes laterally. But in a mill course it may be considerable.\n\nWe have considered only the action on one float, but several generally act at once. The impulse on most of them must be oblique, and is therefore less than when the same stream impinges perpendicularly; and this diminution of impulse is, by the common theory, in the proportion of the sine of the obliquity. For this reason it is maintained, that the impulse of the whole stream on the lowest floatboard, which is perpendicular to the stream, is equal to the sum of the impulses made on all the floats which then dip into the water; or that the impulse on any oblique float is precisely equal to the impulse which that part of the stream would have made on the lowest floatboard had it not been interrupted. Therefore it has been recommended to make such a number of floatboards, that when one of them is at the bottom of the wheel, and perpendicular to the stream, the next in succession should be just entering into the water. But since the impulse on a float by no means annihilates all the motion of the water, and it bends round it and hits the one behind with its remaining force, there must be some advantage gained by employing a greater number of floats than this rule will permit. This is abundantly confirmed by the experiments of Smeaton and Boffin. Mr. Boffin formed three or four suppositions of the number of floats, and calculated the impulse on each; according to the observations made in a course of experiments made by the Academy of Sciences, and inserted by us in the article RESISTANCE OF Fluids; and when he summed them up, and compared the results with his experiments, he found the agreement very satisfactory. He deduces a general rule, that if the velocity of the wheel is one-third of that of the stream, and if 72 degrees of the circumference are immersed in the stream, the wheel should have 36 floats. Each will dip one-fifth of the radius. The velocity being still supposed the same, there should be more or fewer floats according as the arch is less or greater than 72 degrees.\n\nSuch is the theory, and such are the circumstances which it leaves undetermined. The accumulation of the water on a floatboard, and the force with which it may still strike another, are too intricate to be assigned with any tolerable precision: For such reasons we must acknowledge that the theory of underhot wheels is still very imperfect, and that recourse must be had to experience for their improvement. We therefore strongly recommend the perusal of Mr. Smeaton's experiments on underhot wheels, contained in the same dissertation with those we have quoted on overshot wheels. We have only to observe, that to an ordinary reader the experiments will appear too much in favour of underhot wheels. His aim is partly to establish a theory, which will state the relation between their performance and the velocity of\nof the stream, and partly to state the relation between the power expended and the work done. The velocity in his experiments is always considerably below that which a body would acquire by falling from the surface of the head of water; or it is the velocity acquired by a shorter fall. Therefore if we estimate the power expended by the quantity of water multiplied by this diminished fall, we shall make it too small; and the difference in some cases is very great: yet, even with these conceptions, it appears that the utmost performance of an underflow wheel does not surpass the raising one-third of the expended water to the place from which it came. It is therefore far inferior to an overflow wheel expending the same power; and Mr Belidor has led engineers into very mistaken maxims of construction, by saying that overflow wheels should be given up, even in the case of great falls, and that we should always bring on the water from a sluice in the very bottom of the dam, and bring it to the wheel with as great velocity as possible. Mr Smeaton also says, that the maximum takes place when the velocity of the wheel is two-fifths of that of the stream, instead of two-sixths according to the theory; and this agrees with the experiments of Boffet. But he measured the velocity by means of the quantity of water which run past. This must give a velocity somewhat too small; as will appear by attending to Buat's observations on the superficial, the mean, and the bottom velocities.\n\nThe rest of his observations are most judicious, and well adapted to the instruction of practitioners. We have only to add to them the observations of Des Parcieux and Boffet, who have evinced, by very good experiments, that there is a very sensible advantage gained by inclining the floatboards to the radius of the wheel about 20 degrees, so that the lowest floatboard shall not be perpendicular, but have its point turned up the stream about 20 degrees. This inclination causes the water to heap up along the floatboard, and act by its weight. The floats should therefore be made much broader than the vein of water interrupted by them is deep.\n\nSome engineers, observing the great superiority of overflow wheels above underflow wheels driven by the same expense of power, have proposed to bring the water home to the bottom of the wheel on an even bottom, and to make the floatboard no deeper than the aperture of the sluice, which would permit the water to run out. The wheel is to be fitted with a close pole and sides, exactly fitted to the end of this trough, so that if the wheel is at rest, the water may be dammed up by the pole and floatboard. It will therefore press forward, the floatboard with the whole force of the head of water. But this cannot answer; for if we suppose no floatboards, the water will flow out at the bottom, propelled in the manner those persons suppose; and it will be supplied from behind, the water coming slowly from all parts of the trough to the hole below the wheel. But now add the floats, and suppose the wheel in motion with the velocity that is expected. The other floats must drag into motion all the water which lies between them, giving to the greatest part of it a motion vastly greater than it would have taken in consequence of the pressure of the water behind it; and the water out of the reach of the floats will remain still, which it would not have done independent of the floatboards above it, because it would have contributed to the expense of the hole. The motion therefore which the wheel will acquire by this construction must be so different from what is expected, that we can hardly say what it will be.\n\nWe are therefore persuaded, that the best way of delivering the water on an underflow wheel in a close mill-course is, to let it slide down a very smooth channel, without touching the wheel till near the bottom, where the wheel should be exactly fitted to the course; or, to make the floats exceedingly broader than the depth of the vein of water which glides down the course, and allow it to be partly intercepted by the first floats, and heap up along them, acting by its weight, after its impulse has been expended. If the bottom of the course be an arch of a circle described with a radius much greater than that of the wheel, the water which slides down will be thus gradually intercepted by the floats.\n\nAttempts have been made to construct water-wheels which receive the impulse obliquely, like the sails of a common wind-mill. This would, in many situations, be a very great acquisition. A very slow but deep river could in this manner be made to drive our mills; and although much power is lost by the obliquity of the impulse, the remainder may be very great. It is to be regretted, that these attempts have not been more zealously prosecuted; for we have no doubt of their success in a very serviceable degree. Engineers have been deterred, because when such wheels are plunged in an open stream, their lateral motion is too much impeded by the motion of the stream. We have seen one, however, which was very powerful: It was a long cylindrical frame, having a plate standing out from it about a foot broad, and surrounding it with a very oblique spiral like a corkscrew. This was plunged about one-fourth of its diameter (which was about 12 feet), having its axis in the direction of the stream. By the work which it was performing, it seemed more powerful than a common wheel which occupied the same breadth of the river. Its length was not less than 20 feet: it might have been twice as much, which would have doubled its power, without occupying more of the water way. Perhaps such a spiral, continued to the very axis, and moving in a hollow canal wholly filled by the stream, might be a very advantageous way of employing a deep and slow stream.\n\nBut mills with oblique floats are most useful for employing small streams, which can be delivered from a spout with a great velocity. Mr Boffet has considered these with due attention, and ascertained the best modes of construction. There are two which have nearly equal performances:\n\n1. The vanes being placed like those of a wind-mill, round the rim of a horizontal or vertical wheel, and being made much broader than the vein of water which is to strike them, let the spout be so directed that the vein may strike them perpendicularly. By this measure it will be spread about on the vane in a thin sheet, and exert a pressure nearly equal to twice the weight of a column whose base is the orifice of the spout, and whose height is the fall producing the velocity.\n\nMills of this kind are much in use in the south of Europe. The wheel is horizontal, and the vertical axis carries the millstone; so that the mill is of the utmost simplicity: and this is its chief recommendation; for its power is greatly inferior to that of a wheel constructed in the usual manner.\n\n2. The vanes may be arranged round the rim of the wheel,\nwheel, not like the sails of a wind-mill, but in planes inclined to the radii, but parallel to the axis, or to the planes passing through the axis. They may either stand on a sole, like the oblique floats recommended by De Parcieux; as above mentioned: or they may stand on the side of the rim, not pointing to the axis, but aside from it.\n\nThis disposition will admit the spout to be more conveniently disposed either for a horizontal or a vertical wheel.\n\nWe shall conclude this article by describing a contrivance of Mr Burns, the inventor of the double bucketed wheel, for fixing the arms of a water-wheel. It is well known to millwrights that the method of fixing them by making them to pass through the axle, weakens it exceedingly, and by lodging water in the joint, soon causes it to rot and fail. They have, therefore, of late years put cast-iron flanges on the axle, to which each arm is bolted: or the flanges are so fashioned as to form boxes, serving as mortises to receive the ends of the arms. These answer the purpose completely, but are very expensive; and it is found that arms of fir bolted into flanges of iron, are apt to work loose. Mr Burns has made wooden flanges of a very curious construction, which are equally firm, and cost much less than the iron ones.\n\nThis flange consists of eight pieces, four of which compose the ring represented in fig. 15, meeting in the joints \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(a'\\), \\(b'\\), directed to the centre \\(O\\). The other four are covered by these, and their joints are represented by the dotted lines \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(a'\\), \\(b'\\). These two rings break joint in such a manner that an arm MN is contained between the two nearest joints \\(a\\), \\(b\\) of the one, and \\(a'\\), \\(b'\\) of the other. The tenon formed on the one end of the arm A, &c., is of a particular shape: one side, GF, is directed to the centre O; the other side, BCDE, has a small shoulder BC; then a long side CD directed to the centre O; and then a third part DE parallel to GF, or rather diverging a little from it, so as to make up at E the thickness of the shoulder BC; that is, a line from B to E would be parallel to CD. This side of the tenon fits exactly to the corresponding side of the mortise; but the mortise is wider on the other side, leaving a space GFK a little narrower at FK than at GH. These tenons and mortises are made extremely true to the square; the pieces are put round the axle, with a few blocks or wedges of soft wood put between them and the axle, leaving the space empty opposite to the place of each arm, and firmly bolted together by bolts between the arm mortises. The arms are then put in, and each is pressed home to the side CDE, and a wedge HF of hard wood is then put into the empty part of the mortise and driven home. When it comes through the flange and touches the axle, the part which has come through is cut off with a thin chisel, and the wedge is driven better home. The spaces under the ends of the arms are now filled with wedges, which are driven home from opposite sides, till the circle of the arms stands quite perpendicular on the axle, and all is fast. It needs no hoops to keep it together, for the wedging it up round the axle makes the two half rings draw close on the arms, and it cannot start at its own joints till it crushes the arms. Hoops, however, can do no harm, when all is once wedged up, but it would be improper to put them on before this be done.\n\nA very curious hydraulic machine was erected at Zurich by H. Andreas Wirtz, a tinplate worker of that place. The invention shows him to be a person of very uncommon mechanical knowledge and sagacity. As it is a machine which operates on a principle widely different from all other hydraulic machines, and is really excellent in its kind, we presume that our readers will not be displeased with some account of it.\n\nFig. 16. is a sketch of the section of the machine, as it was first erected by Wirtz at a ceyhouse in Limmat, in the suburbs or vicinity of Zurich. It consists of a hollow cylinder, like a very large grindstone, turning on a horizontal axis, and partly plunged in a cistern of water. The axis is hollow at one end, and communicates with a perpendicular pipe CBZ', part of which is hid by the cylinder. This cylinder or drum is formed into a spiral canal by a plate coiled up within it like the main spring of a watch in its box; only the spires are at a distance from each other, so as to form a conduit for the water of uniform width. This spiral partition is well joined to the two ends of the cylinder, and no water escapes between them. The outermost turn of the spiral begins to widen about three-fourths of a circumference from the end, and this gradual enlargement continues from Q to S nearly a semicircle: this part may be called the Horn. It then widens suddenly, forming a Scoop or shovel SS'. The cylinder is supported so as to dip several inches into the water, whose surface is represented by VV'.\n\nWhen this cylinder is turned round its axis in the direction ABEO, as expressed by the two darts, the scoop SS' dips at V', and takes up a certain quantity of water before it emerges again at V. This quantity is sufficient to fill the taper part SQ, which we have called the Horn; and this is nearly equal in capacity to the outermost uniform spiral round.\n\nAfter the scoop has emerged, the water passes along the spiral by the motion of it round the axis, and drives the air before it into the rising-pipe, where it escapes.\u2014In the mean time, air comes in at the mouth of the scoop; and when the scoop again dips into the water, it again takes in some. Thus there is now a part filled with water and a part filled with air. Continuing this motion, we shall receive a second round of water and another of air. The water in any turn of the spiral will have its two ends on a level; and the air between the successive columns of water will be in its natural state; for since the passage into the rising-pipe or Main is open, there is nothing to force the water and air into any other position. But since the spires gradually diminish in their length, it is plain that the column of water will gradually occupy more and more of the circumference of each. At last it will occupy a complete turn of some spiral that is near the centre; and when sent farther in, by the continuance of the motion, some of it will run back over the top of the succeeding spiral. Thus it will run over at K4 into the right-hand side of the third spiral. Therefore it will push the water of this spire backwards, and raise its other end, so that it also will run over backwards before the next turn be completed. And this change of disposition will at last reach the first or outermost spiral, and some water will run over into the horn and scoop, and finally into the cistern.\n\nBut as soon as water gets into the rising-pipe, and\nrises a little in it, it stops the escape of the air when the next scoop of water is taken in. Here are now two columns of water acting against each other by hydrostatic pressure and the intervening column of air. They must compress the air between them, and the water and air columns will now be unequal. This will have a general tendency to keep the whole water back, and cause it to be higher on the left or rising side of each spire than on the right defending side. The excess of height will be just such as produces the compression of the air between that and the preceding column of water. This will go on increasing as the water mounts in the rising pipe; for the air next to the rising pipe is compressed at its inner end with the weight of the whole column in the main. It must be as much compressed at its outer end. This must be done by the water column without it; and this column exerts this pressure partly by reason that its outer end is higher than its inner end, and partly by the transmission of the pressure on its outer end by air, which is similarly compressed from without. And thus it will happen that each column of water, being higher at its outer than at its inner end, compresses the air on the water column beyond or within it, which transmits this pressure to the air beyond it, adding to it the pressure arising from its own want of level at the ends. Therefore the greatest compression, viz. that of the air next the main, is produced by the sum of all the transmitted pressures; and these are the sum of all the differences between the elevation of the inner ends of the water columns above their outer ends: and the height to which the water will rise in the main will be just equal to this sum.\n\nDraw the horizontal lines K'K 1, K'K 2, K'K 3, &c. and m n, m n, m n, &c. Suppose the left-hand spaces to be filled with water, and the right-hand spaces to be filled with air. There is a certain gradation of compression which will keep things in this position. The spaces evidently decrease in arithmetical progression; so do the hydrostatic heights and pressures of the water columns. If therefore the air be dense in the same progression, all will be in hydrostatic equilibrium. Now this is evidently producible by the mere motion of the machine; for since the density and compression in each air column is supposed inversely as the bulk of the column, the absolute quantity of air is the same in all; therefore the column first taken in will press gradually inwards, and the increasing compression will cause it to occupy precisely the whole right-hand side of every spire. The gradual diminution of the water columns will be produced during the motion by the water running over backwards at the top, from spire to spire, and at last coming out by the scoop.\n\nIt is evident that this disposition of the air and water will raise the water to the greatest height, because the hydrostatic height of each water column is the greatest possible, viz. the diameter of the fore. This disposition may be obtained in the following manner: Take CL to CB as the density of the external air to its density in the last column next the rising pipe or main; that is, make CL to CB as 33 feet (the height of the column of water which balances the atmosphere), to the sum of 33 feet and the height of the rising pipe. Then divide BL into such a number of turns, that the sum of their diameters shall be equal to the height of the main; then bring a pipe straight from L to the centre C. The reason of all this is very evident.\n\nBut when the main is very high, this construction will require a very great diameter of the drum, or many turns of a very narrow pipe. In such cases it will be much better to make the spiral in the form of a corkscrew, as in fig. 17, instead of this flat form like a watch-spring. The pipe which forms the spiral may be lapped round the frustum of a cone, whose greatest diameter is to the least (which is next to the rising pipe) in the same proportion that we assigned to CB and CL. By this construction the water will stand in every round so as to have its upper and lower surfaces tangents to the top and bottom of the spiral, and the water columns will occupy the whole ascending side of the machine, while the air occupies the descending side.\n\nThis form is vastly preferable to the flat; it will allow us to employ many turns of a large pipe, and therefore produce a great elevation of a large quantity of water.\n\nThe same thing will be still better done by lapping the pipe on a cylinder, and making it taper to the end, in such a proportion that the contents of each round may be the same as when it is lapped round the cone. It will raise the water to a greater height (but with an increase of the impelling power) by the same number of turns, because the vertical or pressing height of each column is greater.\n\nNay, the same thing may be done in a more simple manner, by lapping a pipe of uniform bore round a cylinder. But this will require more turns, because the water columns will have less difference between the heights of their two ends. It requires a very minute investigation to show the progress of the columns of air and water in this construction, and the various changes of their arrangement, before one is attained which will continue during the working of the machine.\n\nWe have chosen for the description of the machine that construction which made its principle and manner of working most evident, namely, which contained the same material quantity of air in each turn of the spiral, more and more compressed as it approaches to the rising pipe. We should otherwise have been obliged to investigate in great detail the gradual progress of the water, and the frequent changes of its arrangement, before we could see that one arrangement would be produced which would remain constant during the working of the machine. But this is not the best construction. We see that, in order to raise water to the height of a column of 34 feet, which balances the atmosphere, the air in the last spire is compressed into half its bulk; and the quantity of water delivered into the main at each turn is but half of what was received into the first spire, the rest flowing back from spire to spire, and being discharged at the spout.\n\nBut it may be constructed so as that the quantity of water in each spire may be the same that was received into the first; by which means a greater quantity (double in the instance now given) will be delivered into the main, and raised to the same height by very nearly the same force.\u2014This may be done by another proportion of the capacity of the spires, whether by a change of their caliber or of their diameters. Suppose the bore to be the same, the diameter must be made such that the constant column of water, and the column of air, com-\npressed to the proper degree, may occupy the whole circumference. Let A be the column of water which balances the atmosphere, and h the height to which the water is to be raised. Let A be to A + h as 1 to m.\n\nIt is plain that m will represent the density of the air in the last spire, if its natural density be 1, because it is pressed by the column A + h, while the common air is pressed by A. Let 1 represent the constant water column, and therefore nearly equal to the air column in the first spire. The whole circumference of the last spire must be \\( \\frac{1}{m} \\) in order to hold the water 1, and the air compressed into the space \\( \\frac{1}{m} \\) or \\( \\frac{A}{A + h} \\).\n\nThe circumference of the first spire is 1 + 1 or 2. Let D and d be the diameters of the first and last spires; we have \\( 2 : 1 + \\frac{1}{m} = D : d \\), or \\( 2m : m + 1 = D : d \\).\n\nTherefore if a pipe of uniform bore be lapped round a cone, of which D and d are the end diameters, the spirals will be very nearly such as will answer the purpose. It will not be quite exact, for the intermediate spirals will be somewhat too large. The conoidal frustum should be formed by the revolution of a curve of the logarithmic kind. But the error is very trifling.\n\nWith such a spiral, the full quantity of water which was confined in the first spiral will find room in the last, and will be sent into the main at every turn. This is a very great advantage, especially when the water is to be much raised. The saving of power by this change of construction is always in proportion of the greatest compression of the air.\n\nThe great difficulty in the construction of any of these forms is in determining the form and position of the horn and the scoop; and on this greatly depends the performance of the machine. The following instructions will make it pretty easy.\n\nLet ABEO (fig. 18.) represent the first or outermost round of the spiral, of which the axis is C. Suppose it immersed up to the axis in the water VV', we have seen that the machine is most effective when the surfaces KB and ON of the water columns are distant the whole diameter BO of the spiral. Therefore let the pipe be first suppoled of equal caliber to the very mouth Ee, which we suppose to be just about to dip into the water. The surface ON is kept there, in opposition to the pressure of the water column BAO, by the compressed air contained in the quadrant OE, and in the quadrant which lies behind EB. And this compression is supported by the columns behind, between this spire and the rising pipe. But the air in the outermost quadrant EB is in its natural state, communicating as yet with the external air. When, however, the mouth Ee has come round to A, it will not have the water standing in it in the same manner, leaving the half space BEO filled with compressed air; for it took in and confined only what filled the quadrant BE. It is plain, therefore, that the quadrant BE must be so shaped as to take in and confine a much greater quantity of air; so that when it has come to A, the space BEO may contain air sufficiently dense to support the column AO. But this is not enough: For when the wide mouth, now at Aa, rises up to the top, the surface of the water in it rises also, because the part AOOa is more capacious than the cylindric part OEO which succeeds it, and which cannot contain all the water that it does. Since, then, the water in the spire rises above A, it will press the water back from ON to some other position m'n', and the pressing height of the water column will be diminished by this rising on the other side of O. In short, the horn must begin to widen, not from B, but from A, and must occupy the whole semicircle ABE; and its capacity must be to the capacity of the opposite cylindrical side as the sum of BO, and the height of a column of water which balances the atmosphere to the height of that column. For then the air which filled it, when of the common density, will fill the uniform side BEO, when compressed so as to balance the vertical column BO. But even this is not enough; for it has not taken in enough of water. When it dipped into the cistern at E, it carried air down with it, and the pressure of the water in the cistern caused the water to rise into it a little way; and some water must have come over at B from the other side, which was drawing narrower. Therefore when the horn is in the position EOa, it is not full of water. Therefore when it comes into the situation OAB, it cannot be full nor balance the air on the opposite side. Some will therefore come out at O, and rise up through the water. The horn must therefore, 1st, extend at least from O to B, or occupy half the circumference; and, 2dly, It must contain at least twice as much water as would fill the side BEO. It will do little harm though it be much larger; because the surplus of air which it takes in at E will be discharged, as the end Ee of the horn rises from O to B, and it will leave the precise quantity that is wanted. The overplus water will be discharged as the horn comes round to dip again into the cistern. It is possible, but requires a discussion too intricate for this place, to make it of such a size and shape, that while the mouth moves from E to B, passing through O and A, the surface of the water in it shall advance from E to ON, and be exactly at O when the beginning or narrow end of the horn arrives there.\n\nWe must also secure the proper quantity of water. When the machine is so much immersed as to be up to the axis in water, the capacity which thus secures the proper quantity of air will also take in the proper quantity of water. But it may be erected so as that the spirals shall not even reach the water. In this case it will answer our purpose if we join to the end of the horn a scoop or shovel QRSB (fig. 19.), which is so formed as to take in at least as much water as will fill the horn. This is all that is wanted in the beginning of the motion along the spiral, and more than is necessary when the water has advanced to the succeeding spire; but the overplus is discharged in the way we have mentioned. At the same time, it is needless to load the machine with more water than is necessary, merely to throw it out again. We think that if the horn occupies fully more than one-half of the circumference, and contains as much as will fill the whole round, and if the scoop lifts as much as will certainly fill the horn, it will do very well.\n\nN.B. The scoop must be very open on the side next the axis, that it may not confine the air as soon as it enters the water. This would hinder it from receiving water enough.\nThe following dimensions of a machine erected at Florence, and whose performance corresponded extremely well with the theory, may serve as an example.\n\nThe spiral is formed on a cylinder of 10 feet diameter, and the diameter of the pipe is 6 inches. The smaller end of the horn is of the same diameter; and it occupies three-fourths of the circumference, and it is 7\\(\\frac{8}{9}\\) inches wide at the outer end. Here it joins the scoop, which lifts as much water as fills the horn, which contains 4340 Swedish cubic inches, each = 1,577 English. The machine makes six turns in a minute, and raises 13.54 pounds of water, or 22 cubic feet, 10 feet high in a minute.\n\nThe above account will, we hope, sufficiently explain the manner in which this singular hydraulic machine produces its effect. When everything is executed by the maxims which we have deduced from its principles, we are confident that its performance will correspond to the theory; and we have the Florentine machine as a proof of this. It raises more than \\(\\frac{7}{9}\\)ths of what the theory promises, and it is not perfect. The spiral is of equal caliber, and is formed on a cylinder. The friction is so inconsiderable in this machine, that it need not be mended; but the great excellency is, that whatever imperfection there may be in the arrangement of the air and water columns, this only affects the elegance of the execution, causing the water to make a few more turns in the spiral before it can mount to the height required; but wastes no power, because the power employed is always in proportion to the sum of the vertical columns of water in the rising side of the machine; and the height to which the water is raised by it is in the very same proportion. It should be made to move very slow, that the water be not always dragged up by the pipes, which would cause more to run over from each column, and diminish the pressure of the remainder.\n\nIf the rising-pipe be made wide, and thus room be made for the air to escape freely up through the water, it will rise to the height assigned; but if it be narrow, so that the air cannot get up, it rises almost as low as the water, and by this circumstance the water is raised to a much greater height mixed with air, and this with hardly any more power. It is in this way that we can account for the great performance of the Florentine machine, which is almost triple of what a man can do with the finest pump that ever was made: indeed the performance is so great, that one is apt to suspect some inaccuracy in the accounts. The entry into the rising-pipe should be no wider than the last part of the spiral; and it would be advisable to divide it into four channels by a thin partition, and then to make the rising-pipe very wide, and to put into it a number of slender rods, which would divide it into slender channels that would completely entangle the air among the water. This will greatly increase the height of the heterogeneous column. It is surprising that a machine that is so very promising should have attracted so little notice. We do not know of any being erected out of Switzerland except at Florence in 1778. The account of its performance was in consequence of a very public trial in 1779, and honourable declaration of its merit, by Sig. Lorenzo Ginori, who erected another, which fully equalled it. It is shortly mentioned by Professor Sulzer of Berlin, in the Sammlungen Vermischten Schriften for 1784. A description of it is published by the Philosophical Society at Zurich in 1766, and in the descriptions published by the Society in London for the encouragement of Arts in 1776. The celebrated Daniel Bernoulli has published a very accurate theory of it in the Peterburgh Commentaries for 1772, and the machines at Florence were erected according to his instructions. Baron Alftromer in Sweden caused a glass model of it to be made, to exhibit the internal motions for the instruction of artists, and also ordered an operative engine to be erected; but we have not seen any account of its performance. It is a very intricate machine in its principles; and an ignorant engineer, nay the most intelligent, may erect one which shall hardly do anything; and yet, by a very trifling change, may become very powerful. We presume that failures of this kind have turned the attention of engineers from it; but we are persuaded that it may be made very effective, and we are certain that it must be very durable. Fig. 20. is a section of the manner in which the author has formed the communication between the spiral and the rising-pipe. P is the end of the hollow axis which is united with the solid iron axis. Adjoining to P, on the under side, is the entry from the last turn of the spiral. At Q is the collar which rests on the supports, and turns round in a hole of bell-metal. ff is a broad flanch cast in one piece with the hollow part. Beyond this the pipe is turned somewhat smaller, very round and smooth, so as to fit into the mouth of the rising-pipe, like the key of a clock. This mouth has a plate ee attached to it. There is another plate dd, which is broader than ee, and is not fixed to the cylindrical part, but moves easily round it. In this plate are four screws, such as g, g, which go into holes in the plate ff, and thus draw the two plates ff and dd together, with the plate ee between them. Pieces of thin leather are put on each side of ee; and thus all escape of water is effectually prevented, with a very moderate compression and friction.","sp":331,"ep":369},{"h":"WATERFORD","t":"a city and sea-port of Ireland, in a county of the same name, with a bishop's see.

He was the son of an apothecary of that place, who was also a brewer. Having gone through the usual course of languages and philosophy at the school and university of his native place, and also entered on the study of divinity, a desire of being acquainted with a larger circle of literature, and of improving himself in every branch of knowledge, carried him, first to the university of Glasgow, and afterwards to that of Edinburgh. The period of theological studies at the universities of Scotland is four years; but during that period, young men of ingenious minds find sufficient leisure to carry on and advance the pursuits of general knowledge. Mr Watson pursued his studies with ardour. Few men ever studied more constantly. It was a rule with him to study eight hours every day; and this law he observed during the whole course of his life. An acquaintance with the polite writers of England, after the union of the two kingdoms, became general in Scotland; and in Watson's younger years, an emulation began to prevail of writing pure and elegant English. Mr Watson applied himself with great industry to the principles of philosophical or universal grammar; and by a combination of these, with the authority of the best English writers, formed a course of lectures on style or language. He proceeded to the study of rhetoric or eloquence; the principles of which he endeavored to trace to the nature of the human mind. He delivered a course of lectures in Edinburgh on these subjects; and met with the countenance, approbation, and friendship of Lord Kames, Mr Hume, with other men of genius and learning.\n\nAt this time he had become a preacher; and a vacancy having happened in one of the churches of St Andrew's, he offered himself a candidate for that living, but was disappointed. Soon after he was appointed professor of logic; and he obtained also a patent from the crown, constituting him professor of rhetoric and belles lettres. The study of logic, in St Andrews, as in most other places, was at this time confined to syllogisms, modes, and figures. Mr Watson, whose mind had been opened by conversation, and by reading the writings of the wits that had begun to flourish in the Scotch capital, prepared and read to his students a course of metaphysics and logics on the most enlightened plan; in which he analyzed the powers of the mind, and entered deeply into the nature of the different species of evidence of truth or knowledge. By his history of Philip II. Dr Watson attained in his lifetime a considerable degree of celebrity; and his history of Philip III. published after his death, has added to his fame. Of this last performance, however, he has only completed the first four books; the two last were written by the editor of his manuscript, at the desire of the guardians of his children.\n\nOn the death of Principal Tulidolph, Dr Watson, through the earl of Kinnoull, was appointed his successor; in which station he lived only a few years.

He began to preach in 1698, and met with general acceptance; and after officiating as an assistant to the Rev.

The waves of the sea are of two kinds, natural and accidental. The natural waves are those which are exactly proportioned in size to the strength of the wind, whose blowing gives origin to them. The accidental waves are those occasioned by the wind's reaching upon itself by repercussion from hills and mountains, or high shores, and by the washing of the waves themselves, otherwise of the natural kind, against rocks and shoals: all these causes give the waves an elevation, which they can never have in their natural state. For the height of the waves, see Sea.\n\n**Stilling WAVES by means of Oil.** See Sea.\n\n**WAVED,** in Heraldry, is said of a bordure, or any ordinary or charge, in a coat of arms, having its outlines indented in manner of the rising and falling of waves: it is used to denote, that the first of the family in whose arms it stands, acquired its honours by service.\n\n**WAVING,** in the sea-language, is the making signs to a vessel to come near or keep off.\n\n**WAX,** or Bees WAX, in Natural History, a firm and solid substance, moderately heavy, and of a fine yellow colour, formed by the bees from the pollen of flowers. See Apis.\nThe best sort is that of a lively yellow colour, and an agreeable smell, somewhat like that of honey: when new, it is toughish, yet easy to break; but by age it becomes harder and more brittle, loses its fine colour, and in a great measure its smell.\n\nIt appears that wax and the pollen have for their basis a fat oil, which passes to the state of resin by its combination with oxygen. If the nitric or muriatic acid be digested upon fixed oil for several months, it passes to a state resembling wax. Wax, by repeated distillations, affords an oil which possesses all the properties of volatile oils. It is reduced into water and carbonic acid by combustion. The colouring matter of wax is insoluble in water and in alcohol.\n\nFixed alkalies dissolve wax, and render it soluble in water. It is this faponaceous solution which forms the punic wax. It may be used as the basis of several colours; and may be made into an excellent paste for washing the hands. Ammoniac likewise dissolves it; and as this solvent is evaporable, it ought to be preferred when it is proposed to use the wax as a varnish.\n\nFrom the common yellow wax, by bleaching, is formed white-wax, sometimes called, very improperly, virgin-wax. The greater the surface is in proportion to the quantity, the sooner and more perfectly this operation is performed. The usual way is to melt the wax in hot water; when melted, they press it through a strainer of tolerable fine linen, and pour it into round and very shallow moulds. When hardened by cooling, it is taken out and exposed to the sun and air, sprinkling it now and then with water, and often turning it: by this means it soon becomes white. The best sort is of a clear and almost transparent whiteness, dry, hard, brittle, and of an agreeable smell, like that of the yellow wax, but much weaker.\n\nThe common yellow wax is of very great use both in medicine and in many of the arts and manufactures. It has been sometimes given internally in dysenteries and erotions of the intestines; but its greatest use is in the making ointments and plasters, and the greater part of those of the shops owe their confidence to it. The white wax is also an ingredient in some of the cerates and ointments of the shops; and is used in making candles, and in many of the nicer arts and manufactures where wax is required.\n\nSealing-Wax, or Spanish-Wax, is a composition of gum lac, melted and prepared with resins, and coloured with some suitable pigment.\n\nThere are two kinds of sealing-wax in use; the one hard, intended for sealing letters, and other such purposes; the other soft, designed for receiving the impressions of seals of office to charters, patents, and such written instruments. The best hard red sealing-wax is made by mixing two parts of shell lac, well powdered, and resin and vermilion, powdered, of each one part, and melting this combined powder over a gentle fire; and when the ingredients seem thoroughly incorporated, working the wax into sticks. Seed-lac may be substituted for the shell-lac; and instead of resin, boiled Venice turpentine may be used. A coarser, hard, red sealing-wax, may be made, by mixing two parts of resin, and of shell-lac, or vermilion and red lead, mixed in the proportion of one part of the vermilion to two of the red lead, of each one part; and proceeding as in the former preparation. For a cheaper kind, the vermilion may be omitted, and the shell-lac also, for very coarse uses. Wax of other colours is made by substituting other colouring matters for vermilion, as verditer for blue, ivory black for black wax. For uncoloured, soft sealing-wax, take of bees wax, one pound; of turpentine, three ounces; and of olive oil, one ounce; place them in a proper vessel over the fire, and let them boil for some time; and the wax will be then fit to be formed into rolls or cakes for use. For red, black, green, blue, yellow, and purple soft sealing-wax, add to the preceding composition an ounce or more of any ingredients directed above for colouring the hard sealing-wax, and stir the mass till the colouring ingredients be incorporated with the wax.\n\nWAX-Work, the representation of the faces, &c. of persons living or dead; made by applying plaster of Paris in a kind of paste, and thus forming a mould containing the exact representation of the features.

A way may be also by prescription; as if all the owners and occupiers of such a farm have immemorially used to cross another's ground; for this immemorial usage supposes an original grant, whereby a right of way thus appurtenant to land may clearly be created. A right of way may also arise by act and operation of law; for if a man grants me a piece of ground in the middle of his field, he at the same time tacitly and impliedly gives me a way to come at it; and I may cross his land for that purpose without trespass. For\nwhen the law doth give any thing to one, it giveth impliedly whatsoever is necessary for enjoying the same.

Of these there are various kinds, distinguished by the different sorts of cloths, stuffs, silks, &c., in which they are employed, and which are chiefly distinguished by the number and variety of the threads they raise in order to work the warp, either plain or in figures, by making more or less of the woof or thread appear through the warp. In order to DLXXXV, give a general idea of weaving, we shall here describe the parts of the common weaver's loom. Fig. 1, in which e, e' are the front posts, and g, g' the back posts of the loom; l, l', m, m' are the lamms in their place at O, or, as they are called in some parts of Scotland, the headles, and in others the flowers. They are composed of strong threads, stretched between two horizontal bars, an upper and a lower. The threads of one lam are so disposed as to pass between the upper threads of the warp, while they admit the lower threads to pass through loops or small holes in them, and the disposition of the threads of the other lam is such, that while they pass between the lower threads of the warp, they admit the upper threads to pass through the small holes just mentioned. The lamms are suspended from the cross bar or lam-bearer HH, by means of ropes n, n' passing from the upper bars of the lamms over the pulleys at EE, and balanced by weights at the other ends. From the lower bar of each lam or headle a rope passes to the treadles or moveable bars at OO; so that when a foot presses a treadle, the lam fastened to it sinks, while the other rises by means of the balancing weight suspended from the pulley at E. The workman then throws in the woof by means of the shuttle, and closes it by one or two strokes of the lay or batten, of which WB, WB are called the swords, CC the cap, or in Scotland the upper shell, DD the block or under shell, and PP the reed or comb contained between these shells. LL is the bench on which the workmen sit; for the loom which our figure represents is constructed for weaving cloth of such a breadth as to require two workmen, who have their quills in a box d on the middle of the bench on which they sit. Between the workmen's bench and the batten or lay is the breast-bar I, I, a smooth square beam, in which there is an opening to let the web through as it is woven. From this opening the web SS passes to the knee roll or web beam GG, round which it is rolled by means of the spokes, visible in the figure, and kept from being unrolled by a wheel with teeth and clench, visible likewise in the figure. In some looms the web passes from the knee roll to the wooden frame X, to be dried as it is woven. Opposite to the breast-bar, and on the other side of the batten or lay, is the cane-roll or yarn-beam, on which the warp is rolled when put into the loom, and from which it is gradually unrolled as the work proceeds. TT are bobbins filled with yarn of the warp to mend such threads of it as may be broke in the weaving; and Bb, Bb are clues of the same kind of yarn with the borders of the warp, to mend such threads as may there be broken.\n\nFig. 2 represents the common shuttle with the variability in the middle, in which the quill with the woof is placed on a spindle or axis. As this shuttle is thrown with one hand in at one side of the warp, and received with\nWeaving, with the other hand at the other side, it is obvious, that when the web is of a breadth too great for a man to reach from one side of it to the other, two workmen must be employed and much time lost. To remedy this inconvenience, a new shuttle has, in this country, been lately brought into very general use, and called the fig-\n\nFig. 3. ing shuttle, because it flies through the warp with wonderful rapidity on two steel rollers RR (fig. 3.) This shuttle is not thrown with the hand, but moved backwards and forwards by a very simple piece of machinery, of which fig. 4. will give the reader a sufficiently accurate conception. To each end of the batten or lay L is fastened a kind of open box B, b, with the bottom or horizontal side exactly on a level with the threads of the warp of the intended web. In each of these boxes is a vertical piece of wood D, d, of considerable thickness, called a driver. This driver is moved easily on an iron spindle or axis from one end of the box to the other by means of a slender rope CCCD, and a handle H is seen in the figure. When the weaver is to begin his work, he lays the shuttle on its rollers in the box B with the iron tip T (fig. 3.) touching, or almost touching, the driver D (fig. 4.). Then moving the handle H, with a sudden jerk, towards the box b, the driver D forces the shuttle with a rapid motion through the warp till it strikes d, which is impelled by the stroke to the further end of the box b. The two drivers D and d have now changed their positions in their respective boxes; so that the driver which was at the front of its box before, is now at the further end of it, and vice versa. Then by a sudden jerk of the hand towards B the shuttle is driven back till it strike D; and thus is the work continued without the weaver having occasion ever to stretch his arms from one margin of the web to the other. That the shuttle may not, by the unsteadiness of the workman's hand, be driven zig-zag through the warp or out of the place in which it ought to move, the guiding or driving rope CCCD is made to pass through smooth holes or loops C, C, at the ends of the ropes EC, EC, suspended either from the cross bar on the top of the loom or from the treads of the batten.\n\nThis shuttle, we should think, a great improvement in every kind of weaving loom, though some of the older tradesmen, with whom we have conversed on the subject, contend, that it is valuable only in what they call light work, such as cotton or linen cloth, or when the web, if woollen, is very broad.\n\nBut as the labour of weaving is pretty severe, Mr Robert Millar, an ingenious calico-printer in the county of Dumbarton, Scotland, wishing to lessen it, invented, some years ago, a weaving-loom, which may be wrought by water, steam, horses, or any other power, for which invention he received a patent in 1796. The following is his own description of his patent weaving-loom:\n\nFig. 5. represents a side view of the loom, AA, BB; CC, DD, being the frame. a is an axis (which we shall call the spindle) across the frame. On this axis is a sleeve b, two inches thick, having a groove round it, two inches deep, and half an inch wide. The bottom of this groove is circular, except in one part c, where it is filled up to the top; a lever d rests on the bottom of this groove, and is lifted up by it when the elevation e comes round to the situation represented in the figure. By this motion, the lever d acts on the ratchet-wheel e, by the catch f, and draws it forward one tooth, each revolution of the sleeve. This ratchet-wheel is in an iron frame gg, which also properly carries the two catches g and h, which are connected with it at v. The catch u holds the ratchet-wheel in its position, while the lever d and the catch f are moved by the groove c in the sleeve. On the arbor of the ratchet is a small pinion h, working in the wheel f; this wheel is fixed on the end of the roller e of fig. 7. On the side of the sleeve b is fixed a wiper k, which lifts the treadle l. This treadle turns on its joints in the sleeve E, which is fixed to the side of the frame A and D; it is kept pressing on the bottom of the groove in the sleeve by a spring m, fixed to the frame side A, and having a slender rod n from its extremity, joining it with the treadle at l. From the point of the treadle there goes a belt o, which passes over the pulley p, which is seen edgeways in this figure, and is joined to the top of the fly pin q, of fig. 6. At the end of the frame A is the short post F; on this rests the yarn-beam j, having a sleeve r, over which passes a cord, having a weight s suspended to it. The other end of this cord is fastened to the spring u; the weight causes the yarn-beam to stretch the web from the ratchet-wheel e, with its catch u; and the spring v allows the rope to slide on the sleeve as the ratchet is drawn round during the working.\n\nFig. 6. is a front view of the loom. a a is the spindle which carries the sleeve b, and the wipers d and d', which move the treadles w, w, of fig. 5. These use the treadles of the headles, with which they are connected by cords from the shafts of the headles a, s. From the upper shaft there go two leathern belts f, f, to the roller y, furnished each with a buckle, for tightening them at pleasure. The two wipers c, c, on the shaft a, which serve for taking back the lay, have the two treadles x, x, in fig. 7, with a belt from each passing over the roller h 2 of fig. 6, and fixed to the sword of the lay. From the swords of the lay forward is fixed a belt to each end of the roller i; from this roller there goes a cord to the spring j, which serves for taking forward the lay which is hinged on the rocking-tree t. The star-wheel b of fig. 3, and the sleeve b of fig. 1, are fixed to the opposite ends of the spindle a without the frame; and both the wheel and sleeve have a wiper k fixed to them for moving the treadles. In order to drive the shuttle, the belts o, o, go from the points of the treadles, over the pulleys p, p, to the top of the fly-pin q: This turns on a pin joint in a rail r, which goes across the loom. From its lower end there go two small cords to the shuttle drivers g, g, which slide on the iron rods n, n. A long iron rod v goes across the lay, and is hung on two centres at the ends. In this rod v are fixed two small crooked wires w, w, which are more distinctly marked in the little figure w above, which represents a section of the lay. The dot at the lower end of the wire w, in this figure, is the section of the rod v. The shuttle passes between these wires and the lay every shot, and lifts them up, causing the rod v to turn round a little. But if the shuttle should not pass these wires, nor lift them, it would be drawn home by the lay, and destroy the web. To prevent this, there is fixed on one end of the rod v a stout crooked wire z, having a broad or flat head, which naturally rests on a plate of iron, marked and fixed to the back of the lay. This plate has a slit in its\nWeaving, its middle about an inch deep. In this slit rests the rod \\(a\\) of fig. 7, on which is a short stud, which is caught by the wire \\(w\\) when the wire \\(w\\) is not lifted back by the passing shuttle. This will stop the lay from coming home, and will set off the loom.\n\nFig. 7. is another side view of the loom opposite to fig. 5. On the spindle \\(a\\) is the star wheel \\(b\\), on the outside of the loom-frame, on the arms of which wheel is fixed the wiper \\(k\\), as the similar wiper is fixed to the sleeves on the other end of the spindle. The wipers which drive the shuttles are fixed on opposite squares of the spindle, and work alternately. Below the star-wheel is a pinion \\(c\\), which is on a round spindle, turned by the water-wheel, by means of a wheel on this spindle. In a wheel on this spindle are two studs, on which the pinion \\(c\\) slides off and on, as the loom is set off and on by the lever \\(d\\). At the farther end of this lever is the weight \\(s\\), hanging by a cord which passes over a pulley \\(i\\), fixed at the outer end of the spring-catch on which the lever \\(d\\) rests; and thus the loom is drawn in at the upper end of the lever \\(d\\). But when the shuttle does not lift the wire \\(x\\), it catches on the stud on the rod \\(a\\), which is connected with the spring-catch, and the lever \\(d\\) flies off with the weight \\(s\\), and the loom stops working. On the head of the post \\(F\\) is the yarn-beam. The rollers \\(e\\) and \\(f\\) are cylinders, pressed together by a screw-lever, and take away the cloth between them at a proper rate. In the roller \\(f\\) is a groove for a band for driving the roller \\(g\\), on which the cloth winds itself as it is wrought. Wherever springs are mentioned to be used in the above description, weights may be used in their stead, and to the same effect, and more especially upon the treadle of fig. 5, for driving the shuttle.\n\nFig. 8. is a representation of a ribbon loom. 1. Is the frame of the loom. 2. The castle, containing 48 pulleys. 3. The branches, on which the pulleys turn. 4. The tires, or the riding-cords, which run on the pulleys, and pull up the high-lifts. 5. The lift-sticks, to which the high-lifts are tied. 6. The high-lifts, or lifts, are a number of long threads, with platines, or plate-leads at the bottom; and ringlets, or loops, about their middle, through which the cords or crofs-threads of the ground-harness ride. 7. The plate-leads, or platines, are flat pieces of lead, of about six inches long, and three or four inches broad at the top, but round at the bottom; some use black plates instead of them: their use is to pull down those lifts which the workman had raised by the treadle, after his foot is taken off. 8. The branches or cords of the ground harness, which go through the loops in the middle of the high-lifts: on the well ordering of these cords chiefly depends the art of ribbon-weaving, because it is by means of this contrivance that the weaver draws in the thread or silk that makes the flower, and rejects or excludes the rest. 9. The baton: this is the wooden frame that holds the reed or shuttle, and beats or clofs the work: where, observe, that the ribbon-weaver does not beat his work; but as soon as the shuttle is passed, and his hand is taken away, the baton is forced, by a spring from the top, to beat the work close. 10. The shuttle, or reed. 11. The spring of the baton, by which it is made to clof the work. 12. The long-harness are the front reeds, by which the figure is raised. 13. The linguas are the long pieces of round or square lead, tied to the end of each thread of the long-harness to keep them tight. Weaving 14. The broad piece of wood, about a foot square, leaning somewhat forward, intended to ease the weaver as he stoops to his shuttle; it is fixed in the middle of the breast-beam. Some weavers, instead of this, have a contrivance of a cord or rope that is fastened to the front-frame, and comes across the breast; this is called a flopfall. 15. The feet-bench; this leans forward very much. 16. The foot-step to the treadles. 17. The breast-beam, being a cross-bar that passes from one of the standards to the other, so as to front the workman's breast: to this breast-bar is fixed a roll, upon which the ribbon passes in its way, to be rolled upon the roller, that turns a little below. 18. The clamps, or pieces of wood, in which the broaches that confine the treadles rest. 19. The treadles are long narrow pieces of wood, to the ends of which the cords that move the lifts are fastened. 20. The treadle-cords are only distinguished from the riding-cords by a board full of holes, which divide them, in order to prevent the plate-leads, which are tied to the high-lifts, from pulling them too high when the workman's foot is off the treadle: which stop is made by a knot in the treadle-cord, too big to be forced through that hole in the board. 21. The lams are two pieces of thin narrow boards, only used in plain works, and then to supply the place of the long-harness. 22. The knee-roll, by which the weaver rolls up his ribbon as he fees proper, or by bit and bit as it is finished. 23. The back-rolls, on which the warp is rolled. It is to be observed, that there is always as many rolls as colours in the work to be woven. 24. The clamps, which support the rollers. 25. The returning-sticks, or, as others call them, the returns, or the tumblers, or pulleys, to which the tiers are tied, to clear the course of cords through the high-lifts. 26. The catch-board for the tumblers. 27. The tire-board. 28. The buttons for the knee-rolls and treadle-board, described in No. 20.\n\nIt is stated in the proceedings of the National Institute of France, that a report was presented to that body concerning a new machine for weaving ribbed stockings. The advantages which this machine possesses are said to be, that it may be erected at one-half of the expense of the English stocking frame, and that its movements are much lighter. The experience of its operations for two years has confirmed these advantages. Of the nature and construction of this machine we have had no opportunity of obtaining any information; but we thought it worth while to insert this short notice, with the view of directing the attention of such of our readers as may be interested in the improvement of such manufactures.","sp":372,"ep":374},{"h":"WEB","t":"a sort of tissue or texture formed of threads interwoven with each other; some whereof are extended in length, and called the warp; others are drawn across, and called the woof.","sp":374,"ep":374},{"h":"WEBERA","t":"a genus of plants belonging to the class and order pentandria monogyinia.

He was only 13 years of age at the death of his father, and of course could derive little from parental instruction or example. He studied at the university of Edinburgh the several branches of learning with great approbation, particularly\nWebster, particularly those connected with the mathematics, for which he discovered an early predilection. He afterwards attended the lectures of the professor of divinity, and in the year 1733 he was ordained minister of the parish of Culross, and in June 1737, he was admitted to be one of the ministers of the Tolbooth church of Edinburgh. His eloquence was noble and manly, his piety conspicuous, and the discharge of his pastoral duties faithful and laborious. To these qualities he added an enlightened zeal for the external interests of the church, a jealousy of corruption, a hatred of false politics and tyrannical measures, which sometimes exposed him to calumny from the guilty, but secured him the esteem of all who could value independence of soul and integrity of heart.\n\nThe prosperity of fortune which placed Mr Webster in the church of his father, and restored him to the polished society of his native city, was not confined to these favours. Eleven days after his settlement in Edinburgh, he obtained the hand of Mary Erskine, a young lady of considerable fortune, and nearly related to the noble family of Dundonald. The genius of Mr Webster now began to unfold itself. Family connections extended his acquaintance with the nobility. Edinburgh then possessed a number of men, both in civil and ecclesiastical stations, who have saved or adorned their country. With these he was soon to cooperate in defending the protestant interests from the arms and artifices of rebellion.\n\nIn the year 1733, five or six ministers seceded from the church, and being anxious to draw away as many as possible from the communion which they had renounced, they invited down to Scotland in 1741, Mr George Whitefield, a young preacher of great piety and extraordinary pulpit talents. On his way to Dunfermline, he was met and entertained at Edinburgh by Mr Webster and some of his brethren. From them he learned the state of church parties in Scotland; and though he kept his promise of preaching first in Fife, he declined connecting himself with any particular sect. Disappointed of his influence and assistance, the Seceders ascribed the effects of his preaching to sorcery and the devil, while Mr Webster, in a pamphlet which he published on the occasion, attributed them to the influence of the Holy Spirit, an opinion regarded by the Seceders as unfeachable wickedness.\n\nIn the year 1745, Mr Webster remained in the city when it was taken by the rebels, and employed his universal popularity and vigorous eloquence in retaining the minds of the people in the interests of the house of Hanover. His exertions in this were not overlooked by most of the spirited gentlemen who acted in quelling the rebellion. He became an intimate friend of Duncan Forbes of Culloden, Lord Milton, and others.\n\nHe preferred to the latest period of his career, that activity both of mind and body, which distinguished him in the prime of life, obtaining at last his frequent with and prayer, an easy and peaceful death, after a very short indisposition, on the 25th of January 1784. His remains were deposited in the Greyfriars churchyard; and it is not a little remarkable that neither private friendship nor public generosity has yet come forward to testify its regard for two of the most eminent characters of the church of Scotland. The ashes of Webster and Blair repose in the same cemetery, undistinguished from the less illustrious dead. No monumental stone marks the place of their dust.\n\nNature endowed Dr Webster with strong faculties, which were afterwards improved by a considerable share of erudition. He was master in the knowledge of the world and of human nature; his address was engaging; his wit strong as his mind; his convivial powers, as they are called, enchanting. He had a constitutional strength against intoxication, which made it dangerous in most men to attempt bringing him into such a state. His character as a minister was popular in the extreme. His voice was harmonious, and his figure noble. To the poor he was a father and a friend, a liberal patron to poor students. In his person he was tall, and of a thin and meagre habit. His features were strongly marked, and the conformity of the whole indicated genius and independence.\n\nTo him the widows of the clergy are indebted for the establishment of the celebrated Scheme, the plan of which he matured in his mind soon after he was appointed a minister of the Tolbooth church. By it the widows of ministers are entitled to the annual sum of 10, 15, 20, or 25 pounds, according as the clergy pay into the fund yearly, 2l. 12s. 6d.\u20143l. 18s. 9d.\u20145l. 5s. or 6l. 11s. 3d., or to their children in sums of 100\u2014150\u2014200\u2014or 250l, in favour of which an act of parliament was obtained in terms of a petition (17 Geo. II.) with liberty to employ the surplus of the annual payments and expenses in loans of 30l. each among the contributors, and to put out the remainder at interest, on proper security. A second act was procured in the 22nd year of the same reign (1748) granting liberty to raise the capital to 80,000l, including the sums lent to contributors. The fund is conceived to commence from the 25th March 1744. This was followed by another act in the year 1770, discontinuing the loan granted to contributors, and granting liberty to raise the capital to 100,000l.; and the whole economy of the institution was then fixed and determined, a report of the state of the fund being ordered to be made annually to the General Assembly by the trustees, which was to be afterwards printed. The success of the scheme has been complete.","sp":374,"ep":379},{"h":"WEDGE","t":"one of the mechanical powers.

Modern Weights.\n\n1. English Weight.\u2014Mr Renardson, in a paper published in the Philosophical Transactions, has proved, that at first there was but one weight in England, and that this was the avoirdupois. Troy weight was introduced in the time of Henry VII.: At present, both the troy and avoirdupois weights are used in England. Troy weight seems to have derived its name from Troyes, a town in France, where a celebrated fair was kept. It is used for weighing gold, silver, jewels, silk, and all liquors. The avoirdupois is used for weighing other things.\n\nTABLE of Troy Weight, as used by the Goldsmiths, &c.\n\n| Grains | Penny-weights. |\n|--------|----------------|\n| 24     |                |\n| 480    | 20             |\n| 5760   | 240            |\n\nTABLE of Troy Weight, as used by the Apothecaries.\n\n| Grains | Scruple. |\n|--------|---------|\n| 20     | 3       |\n| 60     | 3       |\n| 480    | 24      |\n| 5760   | 288     |\n\nThe troy pound in Scotland, which by statute is to be the same as the French pound, is commonly supposed equal\nWeight equal to 15 ounces and three quarters troy English weight, or 7560 grains. But by a mean of the standards kept by the dean-of-guild of Edinburgh, it weighs 7599\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) or 7600 grains.\n\n**Table of Avoirdupois Weight.**\n\n| Drams | An ounce. |\n|-------|-----------|\n| 16    |           |\n| 256   | A pound.  |\n| 7168  | 448       |\n| 28672 | 1792      |\n| 573440| 35840     |\n\nThe avoirdupois pound is equal to 7004 troy grains, the avoirdupois ounce to 437.75 grains; and it follows of consequence, that the troy pound is to the avoirdupois pound as 88 to 107 nearly; for as 88 to 107, so is 5760 to 7003.636: that the troy ounce is to the avoirdupois ounce as 80 to 73 nearly; for as 80 to 73, so is 480 to 438. An avoirdupois pound is equal to 1 lb. 2 oz. 11 dwt. 20 gr. troy; a troy ounce is equal to 1 oz. 1.55 dr. avoirdupois; an avoirdupois dram contains 27.34375 grains; 175 troy pounds are equal to 144 avoirdupois pounds.\n\nThe moneyers have a peculiar subdivision of the grain troy: thus,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Grain} & \\quad \\text{Mite} \\\\\n\\text{Droit} & \\quad \\text{Periot}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\ninto\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n20 & \\quad \\text{Mites}, \\\\\n24 & \\quad \\text{Droits}, \\\\\n20 & \\quad \\text{Periots}, \\\\\n24 & \\quad \\text{Blanks}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThe English weights are used in the United Provinces of America.\n\n2. **French Weights.**\u2014Different weights were formerly used in most of the different provinces of France: These, however, have undergone very material alterations since the revolution in that kingdom. See Measure. But as a knowledge of the ancient weights of that country is of importance, on account of the books in which they are used, we insert the following tables. The Paris pound contains 16 ounces, and is divided two ways.\n\n| Grains. | Penny-weight. |\n|---------|---------------|\n| 24      |               |\n| 72      | 3             |\n| 576     | 24            |\n| 4608    | 192           |\n| 9216    | 384           |\n\nThe marc is equal, according to M. Tillet, to 4620 French grains.\n\nThe weights of the first division are used to weigh gold, silver, and the richer commodities; and the weights of the second division for commodities of less value.\n\nThe Paris 2 marc, or pound weight, is equal to 7560 grains troy, and the Paris ounce equal to 472.5 grains troy.\n\nlb. oz. dtw. gr.\n\nThe Paris pound = 1 3 15 0 troy.\nThe Paris ounce = 0 0 19 16.5 troy.\nA grain troy = 1.2186507 of a Paris grain.\n\nBut the pound was not the same throughout France. At Lyons, e.g., the city pound was only 14 ounces: so that 100 Lyons pounds, made only 86 Paris pounds. But beside the city pound, they had another at Lyons for silk, containing 15 ounces. At Thoulouse, and throughout the Upper Languedoc, the pound was 13 ounces and a half of Paris weight. At Marfelles, and throughout Provence, the pound was 13\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) ounces of Paris weight. At Rouen, beside the common Paris pound and marc, they had the weight of the vicomte; which was 16 ounces, a half, and five-sixths of the Paris weight. The weights enumerated under the two articles of English and French weights are the same that are used throughout the greatest part of Europe; only under somewhat different names, divisions, and proportions.\n\nFrench weights were formerly used in all the French American settlements.\n\n3. **Dutch Weights.**\u2014The weight used in Amsterdam and all over Holland is called Troy weight, and is exactly the same with that used at Brussels. The Dutch weights are as follows:\n\n| Deuskens. | Troyken. |\n|-----------|----------|\n| 2         |          |\n| 4         | 2        |\n| 16        | 8        |\n| 512       | 256      |\n| 10240     | 5120     |\n| 81920     | 40960    |\n\nThe marc is equal, according to M. Tillet, to 4620 French grains.\nThe Amsterdam pound used in commerce is divided into 16 ounces, 32 loots, or 128 drams. This pound contains 2 marcs troy, and ought therefore to weigh only 10240 as; but it weighs 10280 as, so that it is a little heavier than the Troy pound of Amsterdam: 256 lb. of commerce are equal to 257 lb. troy of Holland. Two different pounds are used by apothecaries; the one containing 2 marcs, the other only 1\u00bd. The first is called arseneic pound weight; it contains 16 ounces, the ounce 8 drams, the dram 8 scruples, the scruple 20 grains. The second is called the apothecary's pound; it is divided into 12 ounces, or 24 loots. Three arseneic pounds are equal to 4 apothecary's pounds.\n\nThe Dutch stone = 8 commercial lb.\nThe Lifpund, or Ll. = 15\nThe hundred weight = 100\nThe Schippondt, or Sch. lb. = 300\n\n4. Spanish Weights.\u2014The marc of Castile, used for weighing gold and silver, is divided as follows:\n\n| Grains (gold weight). |\n|-----------------------|\n| 1\u00bd Grain (silver weight). |\n| 12 11\u00bd Tomine (gold weight). |\n| 12\u00bd 12 Tomine (silver weight). |\n| 37\u00bd 36 3 Adarme |\n| 75 72 6\u00bd 6 2 Ochava. |\n| 96 92 8 7\u00bd 2\u00bd 1\u00bd Castellano. |\n| 600 576 50 48 16 8 Ounce. |\n| 4800 4608 400 384 128 64 50 Marc. |\n\nThe marc, according to Tillet, is equal to 7 oz. 4 gros, 8 grains French, which is equal to 4785 as of Holland. One hundred marcs of Castile = about 93\u00bd marcs of Holland; 100 marcs of Holland = 107 marcs of Castile. Medicines are sold by the same marc; but it is divided differently, containing 8 ounces, 64 drachms, 192 scruples, 384 obolos, 1152 caraceras, 4608 grains.\n\nThe Spanish commercial pound is divided into two marcs, called marcs of Troy, each of which is equal to the marc of Castile. This pound is divided into 16 ounces, 256 adarmes, 9216 grains.\n\n5. Weights of Portugal.\u2014The Lisbon marc for assaying silver coin of 12 deniers, and the denier of 24 grains. The marc of Portugal for weighing gold and silver is equal, according to Tillet, to 7 ounces 3\u00bd gros, and 34 grains French, which makes 4776 as of Holland; so that it is exactly the same with the Lisbon pound. It is divided into 8 ounces, 64 outavas, 192 scruples, 4608 grains.\n\nThe pound consists of 2 marcs, 16 ounces, or 96 outavas; the arroba of 32 lb.; the quintal of 4 arrobas, or 128 lb. 100 Oporto pounds make 87\u00bd pounds of commerce of Amsterdam.\n\n6. Weights of Italy.\u2014Genoa. Two kinds of weights are used at Genoa, the peso grosso (heavy weight), and the peso fottile (light weight); the latter is used for weighing gold and silver, the former for other things. The pound of the peso fottile is equal, according to Tillet, to 1 marc, 2 ounces, 2\u00bd gros, 30 grains French. It is divided into 8 ounces, the ounce into 24 deniers, and the denier into 24 grains. The pound of the peso grosso is equal to 1 marc, 2 ounces, 3 gros, 5 grains, French. It is divided into 12 ounces:\n\n- The cantaro = 100 lbs. peso grosso.\n- The rubbo = 25 lbs.\n- The rotolo = 1\u00bd lb.\n- 100 lbs. peso grosso = 64\u00bd lb. of commerce of Amsterdam.\n- 100 lbs. peso fottile = 129 marcs troy of Holland.\n\nRome. The Roman pound consists of 12 ounces, the ounce of 24 deniers, the denier of 24 grains. The Roman pound, according to Tillet, is equal to 1 marc, 3 ounces, \u00bd gros, 14 grains, French.\n\nVenice. The marc for weighing gold and silver contains 8 ounces, 32 quarti, 1152 carati, or 4608 grani. An hundred marcs of Venice = 97\u00bd marcs troy of Holland, 100 marcs of Holland = 103 of Venice. In Venice they also use a peso grosso and peso fottile. 100 lbs. peso grosso = 94\u00bd commercial lbs. of Amsterdam. 100 lbs. peso fottile = 61\u00bd ditto.\n\n7. Swedish Weights.\u2014The marc for weighing gold and silver is equal to 16 lods, 64 quintins, or 4384 as. The pound of 32 lods, used for weighing food, is equal, according to Tillet, to 1 marc, 5 ounces, 7 gros, 8 grains French, which makes 8848 as of Troy of Holland. This answers exactly to the weight of the different pounds, as fixed in Sweden, viz. 8848 as = the pound for weighing articles of food; 7821\u00be as = marc used in the mines; 7450\u00be as = marc used in towns and in the country; 7078\u00be as = marc used for weighing iron; 7416 as = pound used in medicine.\n\n- The skippund = 400 lbs. for weighing food.\n- The center = 120 lbs.\n- The waag = 165 lbs.\n- The sten = 32 lbs.\n- The Swedith as = 1 as of Holland troy.\n\n8. German Weights.\u2014Vienna. The marc of Vienna for weighing gold and silver is divided into 16 loths, 64 quintals, or 256 deniers or pfennings; the loth into 4 quintals, or 16 pfennings. This marc, according to Tillet, is equal to 1 marc, 1 ounce, 1 gros, 16 grains, French, = 5831 as troy Holland. The pound of Vienna is divided into 2 marcs, or 4 viertings; the mark into 8 ounces, 16 loths, 64 quintals, or 266 pfennings.\n\nHamburg. The marc for assaying gold is divided into 24 carats; the carat into 12 grains. The marc for silver is divided into 16 loths, and the loth into 18 grains. These marcs consist each of 288 grains, and are therefore equal. This marc, used in Hamburg for gold and silver, is the marc of Cologne, which is equal, according to Tillet, to 7 ounces, 5 gros, 7\u00bd grains, French, = 4866 as troy of Holland. It is divided into 8 ounces, 16 loths, 64 quintins, 256 pfennings, 4352 echtes, or 65536 richt pfennings theile. The apothecary pound used in Hamburg, and almost all Germany, is divided into 12 ounces, 96 drachms, 288 scruples, or 5760 grains; an ounce is equal to 621 as of Holland.\nThe pound of commerce is equal, according to Tillet, to 1083 as of Holland; for half a pound is equal to 7 ounces, 7 gros, 23 grains, French. This pound is divided into 16 ounces, 32 loths, 128 quentins, or 512 pfenings.\n\n9. Russian Weights.\u2014The berckowitz = 400 lbs.\n   The pound = 40 lbs.\n   The pound is divided into 32 loths, or 96 folotnicks.\n   One hundred Ruffian lbs. = 166\u00bd marcs, or 82\u00bd lbs. of Amsterdam. One hundred lbs. of commerce of Amsterdam = 120\u00bd th lbs. of Ruffia.\n\n10. Weights used in the several parts of Asia, the East Indies, China, Persia, &c.\u2014In Turkey, at Smyrna, &c., they use the batman, or battamant, containing 7\u00bd occos; the occo contains 4 chekys or pounds, each of which, according to Tillet, is equal to 1 marc 2 oz. 3 gros, 28 gr. French. The Turkish weights are divided as follows:\n\n| Cantaras. | Batmans. | Occos. | Rotolos. | Chekis. | Mefcals. | Drachms. |\n|-----------|----------|--------|---------|--------|----------|---------|\n| 1 = 7\u00bd = 44 = 100 = 176 = 1173 = 17600 | 1 = 6 = 13\u00bd = 24 = 1600 = 2400 | 1 = 2\u00bd = 4 = 266\u00bd = 400 | 1 = 1\u00bd = 10 = 117\u00bd = 176 | 1 = 6\u00bd = 66\u00bd = 100 |\n\nAt Aleppo there are three sorts of rottos; the first 720 drachms, making about 7 pounds English, and serving to weigh cottons, galls, and other large commodities; the second is 680 drachms, used for all silks but white ones, which are weighed by the third roto of 700 drachms. At Seyda the roto is 600 drachms.\n\nThe other ports of the Levant, not named here, use some of these weights; particularly the occa, or ocqua, the rottoli, and roto.\n\nThe Chinese weights are, the piece for large commodities: it is divided into 100 catis or cattis, though some say into 125; the cati into 16 taels or tales, each tael equivalent to 1\u00bd of an ounce English, or the weight of one rial and \u00bd, and containing 12 mas or marles, and each mas 10 condims. So that the Chinese piece amounts to 137 pounds English avoirdupois, and the cati to 1 pound 8 ounces. The pico for silk containing 66 catis and \u00bd; the bahar, bakaire, or barr, containing 300 catis.\n\nTonquin has also the same weights, measures, &c., as China. Japan has only one weight, viz. the cati; which, however, is different from that of China, as containing 20 taels. At Surat, Agra, and throughout the states of the Great Mogul, they use the man, or maund, whereof they have two kinds; the king's maund, or king's weight; and the maund simply; the first used for the weighing of common provisions, containing 40 feers, or ferres; and each feer a just Paris pound. The common maund, used in the weighing of merchandise, consists likewise of 40 feers, but each feer is only estimated at 12 Paris ounces, or \u00bc of the other feer.\n\nThe maund may be looked upon as the common weight of the East Indies, though under some difference of name, or rather of pronunciation; it being called mao at Cambaya, and in other places mein and maum. The feer is properly the Indian pound, and of universal use; the like may be said of the bahar, tael, and cati, above mentioned.\n\nThe weights of Siam are the piece, containing two shans or cattis; but the Siamese cati is only half the Japanese, the latter containing 20 taels and the former only 10; though some make the Chinese cati only 16 taels, and the Siamese 8. The tael contains 4 baats, or ticals, each about a Paris ounce; the baat 4 felings or mayons; the mayon 2 fouangs; the fouang 4 payes; the paye 2 clams; the pompaye half a fouang.\n\nIt is to be observed, that these are the names of their coins as well as weights; silver and gold being commodities there sold, as other things, by their weights.\n\nIn the isle of Java, and particularly at Bantam, they use the gantam, which amounts to near 3 Dutch pounds. In Golconda, at Vilapour, and Goa, they have the furatelle, containing 1 pound 14 ounces English; the manganis, or mangelin, for weighing diamonds and precious stones, weighing at Goa 5 grains, at Golconda, &c. 5\u00bd grains. They have also the rotolo, containing 14\u00bd ounces English; the metrical, containing the sixth part of an ounce; the wall for piastres and ducats, containing the 73rd part of a rial.\n\nIn Persia they use two kinds of batmans or mans; the one called cali or cheray which is the king's weight, and the other batman of Taurir. The first weighs 13 pounds 10 ounces English; the second 6\u00bd pounds. Its divisions are the ratel, or a 16th; the derhem, or drachm, which is the 50th; the mefchel, which is half the derhem; the dung, which is the sixth part of the mefchel, being equivalent to 6 carat grains; and lastly, the grain, which is the fourth part of the dung. They have also the vakie, which exceeds a little our ounce; the fah-cheray, equal to the 1170th part of the derhem; and the toman, used to weigh out large payments of money without telling; its weight is that of 50 abases.\n\n11. Weights at Cairo in Egypt.\u2014Almost every kind of goods has its own weight; these are regulated by the cantaren or principal weight.\n\nRotels.\n\nThe ordinary cantaren, or hundred weight, weighs 100\n\nThe cantaren of quicksilver and tin - 102\ncoffee, wine, and iron - 105\nivory - 100\nalmonds and other fruits - 115\nwoods for dying - 120\narsenic and other drugs - 125\nminium and cinnabar - 130\ngum-arabic, aloes, and other aromatics - 133\n\nThe ratel or rotoli is nearly equal to the pound of Marfeilles; 108 lbs. of Marfeilles are equal to 110 rots. The Marfeilles pound consists of 13 ounces of Paris; so that the 100 lbs. of Marfeilles are equal to 81 lbs. Paris, and 100 lbs. Paris = 123 lbs. of Marfeilles.\n\nWe shall subjoin here Mr Fergulon's table for comparing the English avoirdupois pound with foreign pounds:\n\n| London pound | Antwerp | Amsterdam | Abbeville | Ancona | Avignon | Bordeaux | Bologna |\n|--------------|---------|-----------|-----------|--------|---------|----------|--------|\n| Bruges       | Calabria| Calais    | Dieppe    | Dantzic| Ferrara | Flanders | Geneva |\n| 1.0000       | 1.04    | 1.1111    | 1.0089    | 0.78   | 0.8928  | 1.0089   | 0.8    |\n| Bruges       | Calabria| Calais    | Dieppe    | Dantzic| Ferrara | Flanders | Geneva |\n| 1.0204       | 0.73    | 0.9345    | 1.0089    | 0.862  | 0.75    | 0.9433   | 1.07   |\n| Tables and Traits |        |           |           |        |         |          | Genoa  |\n\nLondon pound 1.0000 | Bruges 1.0204 | Tables and Traits | Calabria 0.73 | Calais 0.9345 | Dieppe 1.0089 | Dantzic 0.862 | Ferrara 0.75 | Flanders 0.9433 | Geneva 1.07 | Genoa\nIn order to show the proportion of the several weights used throughout Europe, we shall add a reduction of them to one standard, viz. the London pound.\n\nThe 100lb. of England, Scotland, and Ireland are equal to\n\n| Weight | Genoa, gros | Hamburg | Lisbon | Leghorn | Norimberg | Naples | Paris | Prague | Placentia |\n|--------|------------|---------|--------|---------|-----------|--------|-------|--------|----------|\n|        | 0.7        | 1.0865  | 1.135  | 0.75    | 1.1363    | 0.71   | 1.1235| 1.2048 | 0.72     |\n\nRochelle | Rome | Rouen | Seville | Thoulouse | Turin | Venice | Vienna |\n|---------|------|-------|---------|-----------|-------|--------|--------|\n| 0.8928  | 0.7874 | 1.1089 | 0.9259  | 0.8928   | 0.82   | 1.06   | 1.23   |\n\nIn order to point out the relative weight with greater precision.\n\nMany attempts have been made to introduce an uniformity of weights and measures into the commercial world; but hitherto they have all failed. The accomplishment of such an undertaking would be of infinite advantage to mankind, and certainly claims the most serious attention of those who by their situation can alone bring it about. The undertaking is indeed difficult, but surely not impossible. Something of this kind has been attempted and adopted in France; and, as the method is simple, and exceedingly well adapted for calculation, it surely deserves to be imitated. See Measure.\n\n**Weight of Air.** See Pneumatics, No. 14\u201419.\n\nRegulation of Weights and Measures, is a branch of the king's prerogative. See Prerogative and Measure.\n\nAs weight and measure are things in their nature arbitrary and uncertain, it is therefore expedient that they be reduced to some fixed rule or standard: which standard it is impossible to fix by any written law or oral proclamation; for no man can, by words only, give another an adequate idea of a foot rule, or a pound weight. It is therefore necessary to have recourse to some visible, palpable, material standard; by forming a comparison with which all weights and measures may be reduced to one uniform size; and the prerogative of fixing this standard, our ancient law vested in the crown, as in Normandy it belonged to the duke. This standard was originally kept at Winchester; and we find in the laws of King Edgar, near a century before the conquest, an injunction that the one measure, which was kept at Winchester, should be observed throughout the realm. Most nations have regulated the standard of measures of length by comparison with the parts of the human body; as the palm, the hand, the span, the foot, the cubit, the ell (ulna or arm), the pace, and the fathom. But as these are of different dimensions in men of different proportions, our ancient historians inform us, that a new standard of longitudinal measure was ascertained by King Henry the First; who commanded that the ulna, or ancient ell, which answers to the modern yard, should be made of the exact length of his own arm. And one standard of measure of length being gained, all others are easily derived from thence; those of greater length by multiplying, those of less by dividing, that original standard. Thus, by the statute called compositio ulnorum et peticarum, five yards and a half make a perch; and the yard is subdivided into three feet, and each foot into 12 inches; which inches will be each of the length of three grains of barley. Superficial measures are derived by squaring those of length; and measures of capacity by cubing them. The standard of weights was originally taken from corns of wheat, whence the lowest denomination of weights we have is still called a grain; 32 of which are directed, by the statute called compositio mensurarum, to compose a pennyweight, whereof 20 make an ounce, 12 ounces a pound, and so upwards. And upon these principles the first standards were made; which, being originally so fixed by the crown, their subsequent regulations have been generally made by the king in parliament. Thus, under King Richard I., in his parliament held at Westminster, A.D. 1197, it was ordained that there should be only one weight and one measure.\nWeight measure throughout the kingdom, and that the custody of the assize, or standard of weights and measures, should be committed to certain persons in every city and borough; from whence the ancient office of the king's assayer seems to have been derived, whose duty it was, for a certain fee, to measure all cloths made for sale, till the office was abolished by the statute 11th and 12th William III. c. 20. In King John's time this ordinance of King Richard was frequently dispensed with for money; which occasioned a provision to be made for enforcing it, in the great charters of King John and his son. These original standards were called pondus regis, and mensura domini regis, and are directed by a variety of subsequent statutes to be kept in the exchequer chamber, by an officer called the clerk of the market, except the wine gallon, which is committed to the city of London, and kept in Guildhall.\n\nThe Scottish standards are distributed among the oldest boroughs. The eland is kept at Edinburgh, the pint at Stirling, the pound at Lanark, and the firkin at Linlithgow.\n\nVarious statutes have been enacted for regulating and enforcing an uniformity of weights and measures; and by the articles of union, the English standards are established by law over all Great Britain. But the force of custom is so strong, that these statutes have been ill observed. The Scottish standards are still universally retained for many purposes; and likewise a variety of local weights and measures are used in particular places of both countries, which differ from the general standards of either.","sp":380,"ep":385},{"h":"WEINMANNIA","t":"a genus of plants of the class oelandia, order monogynia, and arranged in the natural classification with those plants the order of which is doubtful.

It begins distinctly (for it may be traced undoubtedly farther south) near the town of Kungur, in the government of Kafan, in latitude 57\u00b0 20'; runs north, and ends opposite to the Waygatz strait, and rises again in the isle of Nova Zemlya. The Russians also call this range Semennoi Poias, or, the girdle-of-the-world; from a supposition that it encircled the universe. These were the Riphhei montes: Pars mundi damnata a natura rerum, et denfa merfa caligine*; of which only the southern part was known to the ancients, and that to little as Hip. Nat. to give rise to numberless fables. Beyond these were placed the happy Hyperborei, a fiction most beautifully related by Pomponius Mela. Moderns have not been behind-hand in exaggerating several circumstances relative to these noted hills. Ybrand Ides, who crossed them in his embassy to China, affirms that they are 5000 toises or fathoms high; others, that they are covered with eternal snow. The last may be true in their more northern parts; but in the usual passages over them, they are free from it three or four months.\n\nThe heights of part of this chain have been taken by M. l'Abb\u00e9 d'Auteuche: who, with many assurances of his accuracy, says, that the height of the mountain Kyria near Solikamska, in latitude 60\u00b0, does not exceed 471 toises from the level of the sea, or 286 from the ground on which it stands. But, according to M. Gmelin, the mountain Pauda is much higher, being 752 toises above the sea.

The Yalik alone, which rises near the southern part of the eastern side, takes a southern direction, and drops into the Caspian sea. The Dvina, the Peczora, and a few other rivers in European Russia, shew the inclined plane of that part. All of them run to the northern sea; but their course is comparatively short. Another inclination directs the Dnieper and the Don into the Euxine, and the vast Volga into the Caspian sea.","sp":385,"ep":386},{"h":"WESLEY","t":"JOHN, a very extraordinary character, and founder of the sect of Methodists, was the son of the Reverend Samuel Wesley, rector of Epworth in the Isle of Axholme in Lincolnshire, and was born in that village in the year 1703. His very infancy was distinguished by an extraordinary incident; for when he was only five years old, the parsonage-house at Epworth was burnt to the ground, and the flames had spread with such rapidity, that few things of value could be saved. His mother, in a letter to her son Samuel Wesley, then on the foundation at Westminster school, thanks God that no lives were lost, although for some time they gave up Poor Jacky, as she expresses herself; for his father had twice attempted to rescue the child, but was beaten back by the flames. Finding all his efforts ineffectual, he resigned him to Divine Providence. But parental tenderness prevailed over human fears, and Mr Wesley once more attempted to save his child. By some means equally unexpected and unaccountable, the boy got round to a window in the front of the house, and was taken out, by one man's leaping on the shoulders of another, and thus getting within his reach. Immediately on his rescue from this very perilous situation, the roof fell in. This extraordinary escape explains a certain device, in a print of Mr John Wesley, engraved by Vertue, in the year 1745, from a painting by Williams. It represents a house in flames, with this motto from the prophet, \"Is he not a brand plucked out of the burning?\" Many have supposed this device to be merely emblematical of his spiritual deliverance; but from this circumstance it is apparent that it has a primary as well as a secondary meaning; it is real as well as allusive.\n\nIn the year 1713 he was entered a scholar at the charter-house in London, where he continued seven years under the tuition of the celebrated Dr Walker, and of the Rev. Andrew Tooke author of The Pantheon. Being elected to Lincoln college, Oxford, he became a fellow of that college about the year 1725, took the degree of Master of Arts in 1726, and was joint tutor with the Rev. Dr Hutchins the rector. He discovered very early an elegant turn for poetry. Some of his gayer poetical effusions are proofs of a lively fancy and a fine classical taste; and some translations from the Latin poets, while at college, are allowed to have great merit. He had early a strong impression, like Count Zinzendorf, of his designation to some extraordinary work. This impression received additional force from some domestic incidents; all which his active fancy turned to his own account. His wonderful preservation, already noticed, naturally tended to cherish the idea of his being designed by Providence to accomplish some purpose or other, that was out of the ordinary course of human events. The late Rev. Samuel Badcock, in a letter inserted in the Bibliotheca Topographica Britannica, No. XX., says, \"There were some strange phenomena perceived at the parsonage at Epworth, and some uncommon noises heard there from time to time, which he was very curious in examining into, and very particular in relating. I have little doubt that he considered himself the chief object of this wonderful visitation. Indeed his father's credulity was in some degree affected by it; since he collected all the evidences that tended to confirm the story, arranged them with scrupulous exactness, in a manuscript consisting of several sheets, and which is still in being. I know not what became of the ghost of Epworth; unless considered as the prelude to the noise of Mr John Wesley made on a more ample stage, it ceased to speak when he began to act.\"\n\nThe dawn of Mr Wesley's public mission (continues Mr Badcock) was clouded with mysticism; that species of it which affects silence and solitude; a certain inexplicable introversion of the mind, which abstracts the passions from all sensible objects; and, as the French Quietists express it, perfects itself by an absorption of the will and intellect, and all the faculties, into the Deity.\" In this palpable obscurity the excellent Fenelon led himself, when he forsook the shades of Pindus, to wander in quest of pure love with Madam Guyon! Mr Wesley pursued for a while the same ignis fatuus with Mr William Law and the Ghost of De Renty. A state, however, so torpid and ignoble, ill-suited the active genius of this singular man. His elastic mind gained strength by compression; thence bursting glorious, he paused (as he himself somewhere says) \"the immense charm, upborne on an eagle's wings.\"\n\nThe reading of the writings of this Mr William Law, the celebrated author of Christian Perfection, and of A Serious Address to the Christian World, contributed moreover, to lead Mr John Wesley and his brother Charles, with a few of their young fellow-students, into a more than common strictness of religious life. They received the sacrament of the Lord's Supper every week; observed all the fasts of the church; visited the prisons; rose at four in the morning; and refrained from all amusements. From the exact method in which they disposed of every hour, they acquired the appellation of Methodists; by which their followers have been ever since distinguished.\n\nBut a more particular account of the origin of this sect, we shall give from a celebrated publication. \"The Methodists (says the editor of this work) form a very considerable class, principally of the lower people in this country. They sprung up about fifty years ago at Oxford, and were soon divided into two parties; the one under the direction of Mr George Whitefield, and the other under that of two brothers, John and Charles Wesley. These leaders, and, if we except Mr William Law, founders of the Methodists, were educated at Oxford, received episcopal ordination, and always professed themselves advocates for the articles and liturgy of the established church; though they more commonly practised the dissenting mode of worship. But conceiving a design of forming separate communities, superior in sanctity and perfection to all other Christian churches, and impressed to a very considerable degree by a zeal of an extravagant and enthusiastic kind, they became itinerant preachers; and, being excluded from most of our churches, exercised their ministry in private houses, fields,\nWesley fields, &c., not only in Great Britain and Ireland, but also in America; thus collecting a very considerable number of hearers and profelytes, both among the members of the established church and the dissenters. The theological system of Mr Whitefield and his followers is Calvinistic; that of Mr Wesley and his disciples Arminian; and the latter maintains the possibility of attaining final perfection in the present state. The subordinate teachers of both these classes of Methodists are generally men of no liberal education; and they pretend to derive their ministerial abilities from special communications of the Spirit. The Methodists of both parties, like other enthusiasts, make true religion to consist principally in certain affections and inward feelings which it is impossible to explain; but which, when analyzed, seem to be mechanical in their rising and operation; and they generally maintain, that Christians will be most likely to succeed in the pursuit of truth, not by the dictates of reason, or the aids of learning, but by laying their minds open to the direction and influence of divine illumination; and their conduct has been directed by impulses.\"\n\nOur readers will judge for themselves, according to their various modes of education, and to the different lights in which they may respectively view the doctrines of our common Christianity, whether this representation of the origin of the Methodists, and of their distinguishing tenets, be accurate and just.\u2014Not presuming to sit in judgment on the religious opinions of any man, we shall only observe, that an appellation originally given in reproach, has been glorified in every since by those who have distinguished themselves as the followers either of Mr Whitefield or of Mr Wesley. \"After the way called Methodism, to worship them the God of their fathers.\" But the ridicule and contempt which the singularity of their conduct produced, both John and Charles Wesley were well qualified to bear. They were not to be intimidated by danger, actuated by interest, or deterred by disgrace.\n\nThe boundaries of this island were soon deemed by Mr Wesley too confined for a zeal which displayed the piety of an apostle, and of an intrepidity to which few missionaries had been superior. In 1735 he embarked for Georgia, one of our colonies, which was at that time in a state of political infancy; and the great object of this voyage was to preach the gospel to the Indian nations in the vicinity of that province. He returned to England in 1737. Of his spiritual labours, both in this country and in America, he himself has given a very copious account, in a series of Journals printed at different periods. These journals drew upon our laborious preacher and his coadjutors some severe animadversions from two right reverend prelates; Dr George Lavington bishop of Exeter, and Dr William Warburton bishop of Gloucester. The former published, in three parts, The Enthusiasm of the Methodists and Papists compared; the third part of this performance containing a personal charge of immoral conduct. Mr Wesley, in his vindication, published a letter to his lordship, which produced a reply from the latter.\n\nBishop Warburton's attack is contained in his celebrated treatise, entitled The Doctrine of Grace: or, The Office and Operations of the Holy Spirit vindicated from the Insults of Infidelity, and the Abuses of Fanaticism: concluding with some thoughts, humbly offered to the consideration of the Established Clergy, Wesley, with regard to the Right Method of defending Religion against the Attacks of either party; 2 vols. small 8vo, 1762. There is much acute reasoning, and much poignant and sprightly wit, in his Doctrine of Grace; but there is too much levity in it for a grave bishop, and too much abuse for a candid Christian. On this occasion, Mr Wesley published a letter to the bishop, in which, with great temper and moderation, as well as with great ingenuity and address, he endeavoured to shelter himself from his lordship's attacks; not only under the authority of the Holy Scriptures, but of the church itself, as by law established.\n\nOn his return from Georgia, Mr Wesley paid a visit to Count Zinzendorf, the celebrated founder of the sect of Moravians, or Herrnhutters, at Herrnhut in Upper Lusatia. In the following year he appeared again in England, and with his brother Charles, at the head of the Methodists. He preached his first field-sermon at Bristol, on the 2d of April 1738; from which time his disciples have continued to increase. In 1741, a serious altercation took place between him and Mr Whitefield. In 1744, attempting to preach at an inn at Taunton, he was regularly silenced by the magistrates. Although he chiefly resided for the remainder of his life in the metropolis, he occasionally travelled through every part of Great Britain and Ireland, establishing congregations in each kingdom. In 1750 he married a lady, from whom he was afterwards separated. By this lady, who died in 1781, he had no children.\n\nWe have already mentioned Mr Wesley as a very various and voluminous writer. Divinity, both devotional and controversial, biography, history, philosophy, politics, and poetry, were all, at different times, the subjects of his pen: and, whatever opinion may be entertained of his theological sentiments, it is impossible to deny him the merit of having done very extensive good among the lower classes of people. He certainly possessed great abilities, and a fluency which was well accommodated to his hearers, and highly acceptable to them. He had been gradually declining for three years before his death; yet he still rose at four in the morning, and preached, and travelled, and wrote as usual. He preached at Leatherhead, in Surrey, on the Wednesday before that event. On the Friday following, appeared the first symptoms of his approaching dissolution. The four succeeding days he spent in praising God; and he left this scene, in which his labours had been so extensive and so useful, at a quarter before ten in the morning of the 2d of March 1791, in the 88th year of his age. His remains, after lying in a kind of state at his chapel in the city-road, draped in the facerdotal robes which he usually wore, and on his head the old clerical cap, a bible in one hand, and a white handkerchief in the other, were, agreeably to his own directions, and after the manner of the interment of the late Mr Whitefield, deposited in the cemetery behind his chapel, on the morning of the 9th March, amid an innumerable concourse of his friends and admirers; many of whom appeared in deep mourning on the occasion. One singularity was observable in the funeral service. Instead of, \"We give thee hearty thanks, for that it hath pleased thee to deliver this our brother;\" it was read \"our father.\" A sermon, previously to the funeral, had been preached by Dr Thomas Whitehead, one of the physicians to the London...\nWesley, London hospital; and on the 13th the different chapels of his persuasion in London were hung with black.\n\nIt has been justly observed of Mr Wesley, that his labours were principally devoted to those who had no instructor; to the highways and hedges; to the miners in Cornwall, and the coaliers in Kingwood. These unhappy creatures married and buried among themselves, and often committed murders with impunity, before the Methodists sprung up. By the humane and active endeavours of Mr Wesley and his brother Charles, a sense of decency, morals, and religion, was introduced into the lowest classes of mankind; the ignorant were instructed, the wretched relieved, and the abandoned reclaimed. His personal influence was greater, perhaps, than that of any other private gentleman in any country. But the limits of this article will not permit us to expatiate further on the character of this extraordinary man.","sp":386,"ep":388},{"h":"WEST","t":"GILBERT, was the son of Dr West, prebendary of Winchester, and chaplain to King George I. but at 12 years of age lost his father. He studied at Winchester and Eton schools, and from thence was placed in Christ-church college, Oxford. His studious and fervent turn inclined him to take orders; but Lord Cobham, his uncle, diverted him from that pursuit, and gave him a cornetcy in his own regiment. This profession he soon quitted, on account of an opening of another nature, which presented him with a flattering prospect of advancement in life. A number of young gentlemen were to be elected from the universities, and, at the expense of government, were to be taught foreign languages; and then sent to the secretaries office, to be initiated into business, and trained there for public services, as envoys, ambassadors, &c. Mr Gilbert West was one of the few pitched upon; and on his first introduction into that office, Lord Townshend, secretary of state, treated him with singular marks of regard, and the strongest inclinations to serve him were testified from all quarters. But his uncle Lord Cobham's strong opposition to the measures of the government, rendered these advantages entirely fruitless; and the ministers honestly told Mr West, that he must not expect them to distinguish his merit, as any favours conferred upon him would be imputed as done to his uncle Lord Cobham. Mr West now left that office, and all his views of making his fortune; and entering into marriage, retired to Wickham in Kent, where he lived in great domestic comfort and tranquil happiness. He was there visited by his valuable friends, who held the most delightful converse of wit, humour, and learning, supported upon the principles of virtue, sound reasoning, and solid friendship, which rendered the whole cheerful, animating, and instructive. Mr William Pitt, who was one of those that composed this happy society, becoming paymaster, appointed Mr West treasurer to Chelsea-hospital; and he obtained a seat at the council-board, in consequence of a friendship contracted at the school with one of the duke of Devonshire's sons, who procured of his grace his being nominated one of the clerks extraordinary of that office. Towards the latter part of Mr West's life, he wholly applied himself to the study of the Scriptures; being extremely anxious to try his utmost endeavours to reconcile the seeming inconsistencies which gave the enemies to revealed religion a handle to doubt and discredit their authenticity. His observations on the re-\n\nsurrection, which, it has been said, were written to confirm the wavering faith of his great friends Pitt and Lyttleton, bear ample testimony to his reasoning powers and the sincerity of his religion; while his translations of Pindar show him to have been an eminent Greek scholar, and very considerable poet. He had a mind replete with virtue, and was an honour to his country; but died at 50 years of age.","sp":388,"ep":388},{"h":"WEST","t":"one of the cardinal points of the horizon, diametrically opposite to the east; and strictly defined the intersection of the prime vertical with the horizon on that side the sun sets in.","sp":388,"ep":388},{"h":"WESTMINSTER","t":"a city which forms the west part of the capital of Britain, but has a government distinct from the rest.

The chief of these laymen are the high-steward, the deputy-steward, and the high-bailiff, who hold their offices for life. There are also 16 burgesses and their assistants, out of which are elected two head-burgesses, one for the city, and the other for the liberties.

He very early married a young lady, the daughter of Major-General Holmes, which disappointed his father's views of disposing of him in such a marriage as would have been a considerable addition to the fortune and grandeur of his illustrious family; yet that amiable lady deserved infinitely more felicity than she met with by this alliance. This precipitate marriage is thought to have hastened the death of his father; after which the duke, being free from paternal restraints, plunged into those excesses which rendered him, as Pope expresses it,\n\n\"A tyrant to the wife his heart approved;\n\"A rebel to the very king he loved.\"\n\nIn the beginning of the year 1716, he began his travels; and as he was designed to be instructed in the strictest Whig principles, Geneva was thought a proper place for his residence. He first passed through Holland, and visited several courts of Germany; and being arrived at Geneva, conceived such a disgust against his governor, that he left him, and set out post for Lyons, where he wrote a letter to the chevalier de St George, who then resided at Avignon, and presented him a very fine stout horse; which the chevalier no sooner received than he sent a man of quality to him, who took him privately to his court, where he was entertained with the greatest marks of esteem, and had the title of duke of Northumberland conferred upon him. He, however, remained there but one day, and then returned post to Lyons, whence he set out for Paris. He likewise paid a visit to the court of James II., who then resided at St Germain, to whom he also paid his court. During his stay at Paris, his winning address and abilities gained him the esteem and admiration of all the British subjects of rank of both parties.\n\nAbout the latter end of December 1716, he arrived in England, whence he soon after set out for Ireland, where, though under age, he was allowed the honour to take his seat in the house of peers, and immediately distinguished himself, notwithstanding his former conduct, as a violent partisan for the ministry; in consequence of which zeal the king created him a duke. He no sooner came of age than he was introduced to the house of lords in England with the same blaze of reputation. In a little time he opposed the court, and appeared one of the most vigorous in defence of the bishop of Rochester; and soon after printed his thoughts twice a-week, in a paper called the True Briton, several thousands of which were circulated.\n\nThe duke's boundless profusion had by this time so burdened his estate, that by a decree of Chancery it was vested in the hands of trustees for the payment of his debts, allowing him a provision of \u00a3200 per annum for his subsistence. This being insufficient to support his title with suitable dignity, he went abroad and thence to great advantage, with respect to his personal character, at the imperial court. From thence he made a tour to Spain: the English minister was alarmed at his arrival, fearing that his grace was received in the character of an ambassador: upon which the duke received a summons under the privy-seal to return home; but instead of obeying it, he endeavoured to inflame the Spanish court against that of Great Britain, for exercising an act of power, as he calls it, within the jurisdiction of his Catholic majesty. He then acted openly in the service of the Pretender, and was received at his court with the greatest marks of favour.\n\nWhile his grace was thus employed, his neglected duchess died in England on the 14th of April 1726, without issue. Soon after the duke fell violently in love with M. Oberne, one of the maids of honour to the queen of Spain, the daughter of an Irish colonel, whose fortune chiefly consisted in her personal accomplishments. All his friends, and particularly the queen of Spain, opposed the match; but he falling into a lingering fever, occasioned by his disappointment, the queen gave her consent, and they were soon after married. He then spent some time at Rome, where he accepted of a blue garter, assumed the title of duke of Northumberland, and for a while enjoyed the confidence of the exiled prince. But not always keeping within the bounds of Italian gravity, it became necessary for him to remove from hence; when, going by sea to Barcelona, he wrote a letter to the king of Spain acquainting him that he would assist at the siege of Gibraltar as a volunteer. Soon after he wrote to the chevalier de St George, expressing a desire to visit his court; but the chevalier advised him to draw near to England.\n\nThe duke seemed resolved to follow his advice; and setting out with his duchess, arrived in Paris in May 1728, whence he soon after proceeded to Rouen, where he took up his residence; and was so far from making any concession to the government of England, that he did not give himself the least trouble about his estate, or any other concern there; though, on his arrival at Rouen, he had only about \u00a3520 in his possession, and a bill of indictment was preferred against him in England for high-treason. Soon after the chevalier sent him \u00a32000, which he squandered away in a course of extravagance; when, to save the charges of travelling by land, he went from Orleans to Nantes by water, and laid there till he got a remittance from Paris, which was squandered almost as soon as received. At Nantes he was joined by his ragged servants, and from hence took shipping with them for Bilboa, when the queen of Spain took the duchess to attend her person. About the beginning of the year 1731, the duke, who commanded a regiment, was at Lerida, but declined to fight that he could not move without assistance; yet when free from pain did not lose his gaiety. He, however, received benefit from some mineral waters in Catalonia; but soon after relapsed at a small village, where he was utterly destitute of all the necessaries of life, till some charitable fathers of a Bernardine convent removed him to their house, and gave him all the relief in their power. Under their hospitable roof he languished a week, and then died, without one friend or acquaintance to close his eyes; and his funeral was performed in the same manner in which the fathers inter those of their own fraternity.\n\nThus died Philip duke of Wharton, \"who, like Buckingham and Rochester (says Mr Walpole), comforted all the grave and dull, by throwing away the brightest profusion of parts on witty fooleries, debaucheries, and scrapes, which mix graces with a great character, but never can compose one.\n\n\"With attachment to no party, though with talents to govern any party, this lively man changed the free air of Westminster for the gloom of the Escorial, the prospect of King George's garter for the Pretender's; and\nWheat, and with indifference to all religion, the frolic lord who had written the ballad on the archbishop of Canterbury, died in the habit of a capuchin. It is difficult to give an account of the works of a man whose library was a tavern, and women of pleasure his muses. A thousand follies of his imagination may have been lost. There are only two volumes in 8vo, called his Life and Writings. These contain nothing of the latter, but 74 numbers of the True Briton, and his speech in defence of the bishop of Rochester. His other works are the ballads above mentioned; the Drinking Match at Eden-hall, in imitation of the Chevy Chase, printed in a miscellany called Whartoniana; and a parody of a song sung at the opera-house by Mrs Tofts. His lordship also began a play on the story of the queen of Scots.\n\nWHEAT. See Triticum, Botany Index; and for the culture of wheat, see Agriculture Index.\n\nThe three principal kinds of bad wheat are, the blighted, the smutty, and the worm-eaten. Blighted wheat is that of which the stalk is a little twisted and rickety, the blade being of a bluish green and curled up, the grain also is green and tubercled; smutty wheat appears as if great part of the ear had been burnt, some small parts only being free, and, in particular, the stem that rises in the centre of the ear, round which the grain is ranged; worm-eaten or rotten wheat is corrupted without losing much of its natural form, or external appearance; the bulk is filled with a greasy black powder, that is inoffensively feid. It appeared, from the experiments of M. Tillet, that there was a kind of infectious quality in all those kinds of wheat: so that if found wheat was sprinkled with the flour of smutty or rotten wheat, the crop produced would be rotten or smutty. It appeared also, that among the grain which was produced from ground manured with the straw of distempered wheat, there was a much greater proportion of distempered wheat than in that produced from ground manured with the straw of good wheat: the great secret then was to destroy the principle of this contagion in the wheat that was put into the ground; and M. Tillet found, as the result of a great number of experiments, that if the grain, before it is sowed, be well moistened with a solution of sea-salt, or nitre, in common water, none of the ensuing crop will be smutty, or otherwise defective, either in kind or quality; not only supposing the grain that is sowed to be sound, and the soil to be good, but even supposing the grain to be sowed with the flour of smutty wheat, and the ground manured with bad straw.\n\nThe following receipt for preventing smutty wheat was published in 1769 by order of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts: they received it from Mr John Reynolds of Addington in Kent.\n\nA tub is to be procured that has a hole at bottom, in which a staff and tap-hole is to be fixed over a whiff of straw, to prevent any small pieces of lime passing (as in the brewing way); this done, we put 70 gallons of water, then a corn bushel heap-full of stone-lime, unslaked, flinging it well till the whole is dissolved or mixed, letting it stand about 30 hours, and then run it off into another tub as clear as we can (as practised in beer): this generally produces a hoghead of good strong lime-water; then add three pecks of salt, 42 pounds, which, with a little stirring, will soon dissolve; thus we have a proper pickle for the purpose of brining and liming our feed-wheat without any manner of obstacle, which is more than can be said in doing it the common way, and greatly facilitates the drilling.\n\nHerein we steep the wheat in a broad-bottomed basket of about 24 inches diameter, and 20 inches deep (for large sowing, made on purpose), running in the grain gradually in small quantities from 10 to 12 gallons up to 16 gallons, stirring the same.

This done, the wheat will be fit for sowing in 24 hours, if required; but if designed for drilling, two hours pickled will be found best; and if prepared four or five days beforehand, in either case it makes no difference at all; but should the feed be clammy, and stick to the notches in the drill-box, more lime must be added to the lime-water; here the master must use his discretion, as the case requires; for some lime has much more drying or astringent qualities in it than others. If lime-water can be obtained conveniently, much less salt will suffice, but some will be found necessary even then, otherwise the light grains will not float, a thing of more consequence than is generally imagined, and it ought to be skimmed off and thrown aside for poultry, &c.","sp":389,"ep":391},{"h":"WHEEL","t":"in Mechanics, a simple machine, consisting of a round piece of wood, metal, or other matter, which revolves on its axis. See Mechanics.\n\nWHEEL-Carriages. See Mechanics for an account of the general principles.\n\nNo kind of wheel-carriages are of more importance to a commercial and manufacturing country than stage coaches; and perhaps in no kingdom of Europe has the system of travelling in public vehicles been carried to greater perfection, as to comfort and speed, than in Britain. The danger, however, of travelling by these coaches makes considerable deduction from their accommodation otherwise: it is but too well known that this mode of travelling is liable to frequent and serious accidents. Every attempt therefore that promises to be useful in diminishing such danger should have all possible publicity. With this view we are much gratified in having an opportunity of laying before our readers the following account of an invention to render stage coaches more secure from danger, obligingly transmitted to us by the inventor, the reverend William Milton of Heckfield, Hants. For this invention that gentleman has obtained a patent.\n\nThe danger of stage coaches arises sometimes from overturning, and sometimes from breaking down. The overturn is, in general, occasioned either by taking two side-wheels into too deep a hole or ditch, or over too high a bank; or, secondly, by running down too quickly than the carriage is calculated to do, from the top to the sides of a rounded road; or, lastly, by turning a sharp corner with too great velocity. In the two first cases the danger arises from the centre of gravity of the total coach and load being placed too high; and in the last instance, of turning the sharp corner, from the same centre (but which we must now consider as the centre of the vis inertiae) being also placed too high. The danger in the two first cases grows often out of the very circumstances of the road, and meets every one's comprehension;\ncomprehension: the last, which is least obvious, is generally owing to the mere will of the driver; and the better the road, the more he is tempted, without any intention, to go on to produce it: it requires therefore to be more generally understood than it is. It may be thus explained:\u2014A carriage is going along a straight level road at the rate of nine miles an hour: then, though you imagine the horses or pulling power to be in an instant withdrawn, yet will the carriage continue its motion for ten, fifteen, or more yards, and at first with the same velocity, and in the same straight line, in consequence of the acquired motion. Supposing, now, the coach with its four horses going the nine miles an hour along a fine level road, but which has a sharp and sudden corner to turn\u2014the coachman knows it, and wishes to keep his velocity; the horses are aware of both\u2014and by the animal dexterity with which they are gifted, contrive to make the turn without remitting any thing of their speed. Not so the coach which follows them; that has a tendency to persevere in its straight line; and the centre of its effort to do so is the centre of its vis inertiae, the very centre of its gravity. If this centre be low, the turn of the corner may be made with no other inconvenience than a short awkward slide of the hind wheels, onward in the original direction; whereas, if it be high, there will be no slide, but the coach will be overturned, and overturned nearly at that point where its broadside is at rectangles to the straight line of road it has been thus forced to quit: for at that point the safe against such an overturn will be the most disadvantageous, and the check to the onward motion the greatest. The remedy offered against all these causes of the overturn, (whether by a ditch, bank, rounded road, or sharp corner), is to bring down this centre, by placing as much of the luggage as possible in a luggage-box, below the body of the carriage; the body not being higher than usual.\n\nFrom the overturn, we pass to the consideration of the breaking-down; this we must reckon on happening as often in these patent stage coaches as in others. Wheels will come off or fall, or axles will break, in future, as they have done heretofore; but against the disastrous and fatal consequences of such accidents the remedy offered may be thus described.\u2014On each side of the luggage-box, with their periphery below its floor, and each as near as may be requisite to its respective active wheel, there is placed a small strong idle wheel, ready in case of breaking down, on either side, to catch the falling carriage, and instantly to continue its previous velocity, till the coachman can pull up his horses, thereby preventing that sudden stop to rapid motion, which at present constantly attends the breaking-down; and which has so frequently proved fatal to the coachman and outside passengers. In case a fore-wheel comes off, each end of the fore-carriage has its idle wheel. By this provision we shall be, to all effect of safety, continually travelling with two carriages under us. The bottom of this luggage-box is meant to be about fourteen inches from the ground; and the idle wheels seven, six, or five; but if at a still less distance, little inconvenience would result; for when either of them takes over an obstacle in the road, it instantly, and during the need, discharges its respective active wheel from the ground, and works in its stead. If these two principles of safety were applied to the description of the several stage-coach accidents we meet with, there is no doubt but a general conviction would arise, that the safety by these modes is (in vehicles of all kinds,) perhaps as great as can consist with rapid locomotion; and that, sooner or later, legislative authority, in some shape or other, may judge it necessary to interpose, for the purpose of controlling a prejudice against the form essential to this mode of safety. The trial and proof which these principles have been brought to, have not only been by public exhibition, and with preparation; but in all the suddenness, also, of actual heavy work: and the result in both cases has been so exactly the same, as to give continual assurance of the full effect of the remedy, as often as the casualties of the road shall bring it into action.\n\nThe aim in the arrangement of this coach of safety, has been to bring down the load, and consequently the center of gravity, as low as possible: this is thought to make the coach look heavy; and this word, by the ready operation of a prejudice, has been transferred to its going; and one specific reason added withal, that, because the load is low, the draught must be heavy. This point, however, has, in the presence of 10 or 12 competent persons, been brought to the most decisive proof; and it comes out, that it is as indifferent to draught, as it is material to danger or safety, whether a ton be placed on the roof of a coach, or a ton on the floor of the patent luggage-box, about 15 or 16 inches from the ground.\n\nIt has been asked, \"What would this coach do in snow?\" The question has been thus answered by the result of actual work; for the patent coach, after being detained on the road with several other coaches, by a sudden fall of snow, when at last they started together, came in six or seven hours before any of them. They were bound in prudence, to go cautiously along the ground, whose unevenness was invisible; while the patent coach dashed along it with all the confidence and safety of a post-chaise.

This rule will serve for all the wheeling by ranks; as when a battalion is marching by subdivisions with their ranks open, then each rank wheels distinctly by itself, when it comes to the ground on which the ranks before it wheeled, but not before.\n\nIn wheeling, the men are to take particular care neither to open nor close their ranks, and to carry their arms well.\n\nIn wheeling, the motion of each man is quicker or slower, according to the distance he is from the right or the left: thus, when you wheel to the right, each man moves quicker than his right-hand man; and wheeling to the left, each man moves quicker than his left-hand man; the circle that every man wheels being larger, according to the distance he is from the hand he wheels to; as may be seen by describing several circles within one another, at two feet distance from each, which is nearly the space every man is supposed to take up.","sp":395,"ep":395},{"h":"WHELK","t":"a species of shell-fish.

It is a populous country, well furnished with large villages; and there are so many small ones, that they are not above a musket-shot from each other.\u2014The houses are small, round at the top, and encompassed with mud walls or hedges, together with a great number of all sorts of beautiful and lofty trees, which afford the most beautiful prospect in the world, inasmuch that those that have been here represent it as a perfect paradise. The fields are always green, and they cultivate beans, potatoes, and fruits; nor will the negroes here let a foot of ground remain uncultivated. They sow again the very next day after they have reaped. The inhabitants are greatly civilized, very respectful to each other, especially to their superiors, and very industrious. The women brew the beer, dress the victuals, and sell all sorts of commodities at the market. Those that are rich employ their wives and slaves in tilling the land, and they carry on a considerable trade with the product, as well as in slaves; for some of them are able to deliver 1000 of the latter every month. The chief men have generally 40 or 50 wives, the principal captains 300 or 400, and the king 4000 or 5000. They are extremely jealous, and, on the least suspicion, will sell them to the Europeans for slaves. If any one happen to touch one of the king's wives accidentally, he is doomed to perpetual slavery. It is no wonder then that the women are not fond of being the king's wives; and some of them will prefer a speedy death to such a miserable life. They have no distinction of hours, days, weeks, months, or years. The rite of circumcision is used here; but they are not able to tell why they use it, nor whence it is derived. They are such great gamesters, that they will stake all they have at play, not excepting their wives and children. They have a vast number of idols; and they deify the most contemptible animal that they see first in a morning, and even stocks and stones. Their principal regard is for snakes, very high trees, and the sea. An English factor, just arrived, found a snake in the house belonging to the factory, and killed it without the least scruple; which so incensed the negroes, that they were for revenging the death of the snake, not only upon him that killed it, but upon the whole factory; but by means of presents, and the interposition of the people of the other factories, the affair was made up, and the snake honourably interred. However, to prevent such accidents, they gave them warning not to do the like for the future. They have oxen, cows, goats, sheep, hogs, turkeys, ducks, and hens; which last are extremely plentiful. There are many elephants, buffaloes, tigers, several kinds of deer, and a sort of hares. The fruits are citrons, lemons, oranges, bananas, tamarinds, &c., and they have vast numbers of palm-trees, from which they obtain wine. Whidah was conquered by the king of Dahomy. Their trade consists of slaves, elephants' teeth, wax, and honey. The English factory is 200 miles east of Cape Coast Castle, within land.

Wherever it appears, it is very furious; and boats, &c., would inevitably be drawn in and perish with it; but the people who navigate them are prepared for it, and always carry an empty vessel, a log of wood, or large bundle of straw, or some such thing, in the boat with them; as soon as they perceive the whirlpool, they toss this within its vortex, keeping themselves out: this substance, whatever it be, is immediately received into the centre, and carried under water; and as soon as this is done, the surface of the place where the whirlpool was becomes smooth, and they row over it with safety; and in about an hour they see the vortex begin again in some other place, usually at about a mile's distance from the first.","sp":395,"ep":396},{"h":"WHIRLWIND","t":"a wind which moves in a spiral direction, as well as horizontally, which is exceedingly rapid and impetuous, but only of short duration.\n\nDr Franklin's opinion of the origin of whirlwinds has been already given in the article WATER-SPOUT. If his theory be true, it will follow, that no hurricane ever can be so violent as to remove an obstacle of the size of only one cubic inch, provided that was supported by a power equivalent to 15 pounds; for this is the utmost force of the atmosphere when rushing into a perfect vacuum, which never could take place in the centre of a whirlwind or water-sprout. Indeed, notwithstanding the dreadful effects sometimes observed from hurricanes and whirlwinds, we shall easily perceive, that the utmost of their power always falls very far short of this. The diminution of the specific gravity of the air by only one-fourth in the middle of the column, would produce such an afflux of air from all quarters, that an obstacle presenting a surface of one foot square, would require a force of 504 pounds to prevent it from being carried away; which the strongest walls that can be built by human art could scarce resist. Nay, even the tenth part of this, or the diminution of the gravity of the atmosphere by one-fortieth part, would produce a prelude of upwards of 50 pounds on every square foot of surface, which, it is to be doubted, whether any of our common houses could resist.\n\nSome philosophers ascribe the vacuum in the atmosphere, to which, according to Dr Franklin's theory, whirlwinds are owing, to a stream of electric matter rushing with violence into the atmosphere out of the earth. But they do not inform us how this matter comes to be accumulated in that part of the earth; what induces it to pass out of the earth; how it passes invisibly through pure air; or what serves it for a conductor. It seems to be the fashion among certain philosophers to ascribe every phenomenon, with the cause of which we are unacquainted, to electricity. But this is merely substituting a new name, and serves rather to retard than advance our knowledge of nature.\n\nSome kinds of whirlwinds move with a slow motion, and are injurious only by their vortex; while others seem to do mischief as well by their progressive as their whirling motion. Of this kind are those called typhoons; which, by their frequently following the course of rivers, seem thus also to discover their electrical origin. Of the destructive effects of these, we have an instance in what happened in Charlestown in South Carolina, on the 1st of June 1761. It was first observed about noon, Whirlwind on land, upwards of 50 miles west by south of Charlestown, and destroyed several houses, &c., as it passed along, in many places making wide avenues through the woods; from whence every tree and shrub was torn up, and great branches of trees were driven about in the column as it passed along. It directed its course to Ashley river, down which it came with surprising velocity; in its appearance resembling a column of smoke or vapour, whose motion was very irregular and tumultuous. Its momentum was so great, that Ashley river was ploughed to the bottom, and the channel laid bare. As it came down this river, it made a constant noise like thunder; its diameter being computed about 300 fathoms. It was met at White Point by another of the same kind which came down Cooper's river, but with inferior strength; however, on their meeting together, the agitation of the air was much greater, while the clouds, which were driving in all directions to the place, seemed to be precipitated, and whirled round with incredible velocity. It then fell upon the shipping in the road; entirely destroying some, and damaging others; being scarce three minutes in its passage, though the distance was near two leagues. In that short time it did damage to the amount of 20,000l.; and had not its direction been altered by that gulf which came down Cooper's river, it must have totally destroyed Charlestown, as no obstacle whatever seemed capable of resisting its fury.","sp":396,"ep":396},{"h":"WHISKY","t":"a term signifying water, and applied in Scotland and in Ireland to a distilled liquor drawn from barley.\n\nWHISPERING-PLACES.

The person on the left hand side of the dealer plays first, and whoever wins the trick is to play again, thus going on till the cards are played out. The ace, king, queen, and knave of trumps, are called honours; in case any three of these honours have been played between, or by either of the two partners, they reckon for two points towards the game; and if the four honours have been played between, or by either of the two partners, they reckon for four points towards the game, the game consisting of ten points. The honours are reckoned after the tricks; all above six tricks reckoning also towards the game.\n\nGeneral Rules for playing the Game of WHIST.\n\n1. He who is to play first should lead from the strongest suit. If he has a sequence of king, queen, and knave, or queen, knave and ten, he may safely lead the highest of the sequence; but if he has five or six in number, he must begin with the lowest. He must always begin with the highest trump, by which he forces out the superior trumps, and can come in again, to make his strong suit.\n\n2. He should never be afraid to play trumps when he has five in his hand, even of the smallest, although he may not have any good cards of any other suit.\n\n3. With\n3. With ace and king of any two suits, and only two or three small trumps, the aces and kings should be played out, in order to make as many tricks as possible; and having but two or three small trumps, he should never force his partner to trump, if he finds he cannot follow suit; but endeavour to throw the lead into his partner's hand.\n\n4. He should in general return his partner's lead, unless he has some capital cards of his own.\n\n5. As this game is played with the lurch, that is, to have half the stake, five points must be made before the game is out; he should not venture to play trumps when he is four of the game, unless he is very strong, having at least an honour and three trumps, or ace, king, and two small ones.\n\n6. When the game is scored nine, at which stage the honours reckon for nothing, he should be still more cautious how he plays trumps, even if he is strong in hand, and give his partner an opportunity of trumping the adversaries suits, in case he is deficient in them.\n\n7. If his adversaries are six or seven love of the game, he should play a forward or bold game, that he may have a chance, at the risk of a trick or two, to come up with them. If he has but three trumps and other good cards, he may play trumps, especially if he has a sequence, or queen, knave, and a small one.\n\n8. He should always risk a trick or two when the game is much in his favour; because a new deal is of greater consequence to the adversary than one or two points are to him.\n\n9. When the player finds there is a likelihood of either saving the game or his lurch, he should risk the odd trick; but if the game is five all, and he can make two tricks in his own hand, he should make them, in order to secure the difference of two points, which make the game near two to one in his favour.\n\n10. A good player should begin with a small trump, when he has ace, king, and four small ones; for this reason, if his partner has a better trump than the last player, which is an equal wager but he has, he has a chance of fetching out all the trumps, by having three rounds of them.\n\n11. The odds are always in his favour that his partner holds an honour; consequently if he has king, queen, and four small ones, he should begin with a small one.\n\n12. When queen, knave, and four small trumps are dealt him, he should play a small one first, the odds being in his favour that his partner holds an honour; if he has knave, ten, and four small trumps, he should also begin with a small one, for the same reason.\n\n13. If he has knave, ten, eight, and three small trumps, the knave should be played first, by which means the nine may be prevented from winning a trick, the odds being in his favour that three honours are played in two rounds.\n\n14. If an honour is turned up against him on his left hand, and he has ten, nine, and eight, with two or three small trumps; when he is to play, he should play through the honours with the ten, which will force the dealer to play his honour to a disadvantage, if the dealer does not choose to leave it to the option of his adversary whether he will pass it or not; but if he has six trumps of a lower denomination, and not ten, nine, and eight, and no honour turned up against him, he should begin with a small one.\n\n15. In general, when he has two capital cards in trumps, and two or three small ones, he should begin with a small one, for the reason assigned in No. 12.\n\n16. When he has ace, king, knave, and two small trumps, or even one small trump, by first playing the king, and putting the lead into his partner's hand, who will play a trump; judging him to have ace and knave, from his beginning with the king: in this case the knave should be finessed (A), nothing being against him but the queen.\n\n17. If he has knave, ten, eight, and two small trumps, by playing the knave first, it is odds but in two rounds of trumps the nine falls, or he may finesse the eight when his partner returns trumps.\n\n18. With five trumps of a lower denomination, he should begin with the smallest, unless he has a sequence of ten, nine, and eight; then he should begin with the ten.\n\n19. When he has king, queen, ten, and one small trump, he must begin with the king, and wait for his partner's return of the trumps, in order to finesse the ten, by which means he may win the knave.\n\n20. In order to prevent the ten from winning, when he has queen, knave, nine, and one small trump, he must begin with the queen. And in case he has knave, ten, eight, and one small trump, he should begin with the knave, that the nine may not win.\n\n21. If he has ten, nine, eight, and one small trump, he should begin with the ten; thereby he strengthens his partner's hand, leaving it at his option to take it or not.\n\n22. He should begin with a small one, when he has the ten and three small trumps.\n\n23. If he has a good suit, and ace, king, and four small trumps, he must play three rounds of trumps, in order to secure his strong suit from being trumped.\n\n24. When he has king, queen, ten, and three small trumps, he should begin with the king, because he has a chance of the knave's coming down in the second round; and to secure his strong suit, he should not wait to finesse the ten. If he should have queen, knave, and three small trumps, and some good suit to make, he must begin with a small one.\n\n25. If he has knave, ten, eight, and two small trumps, with a strong suit, he should begin with the knave, in order to make the nine fall in the second round; but if he has knave, ten, and three small trumps, with a good suit, he should play a small one first.\n\n26. With ten, nine, eight, and one small trump, provided he has a good suit, he should begin with the ten; by which means he may get the trumps out, and have a chance of making his strong suit.\n\nThe following observations will enable a player to know that his partner has no more of a suit which either\n\n(A) Finesse, is to play a small card which may win, keeping the superior card or cards to lay over the right-hand adversary.\nof them has played. Suppose he leads from queen, ten, nine, and two small cards of any suit, the second hand puts on the knave, his partner plays the eight; in this case, he having queen, ten, and nine, it is a demonstration, if his partner plays well, that he can have no more of that suit. By that discovery, he may play his game accordingly, either by forcing his partner to trump that suit, if he is strong in trumps, or by playing another suit. If he has king, queen, and ten of a suit, and he leads his king, his partner plays the knave; this also demonstrates he has no more of that suit. If he has king, queen, and many more of a suit, and begins with the king, in some cases it is good play in a partner, when he has the ace and one small card in that suit only, to win the king with the ace; for suppose the partner to be very strong in trumps, by taking the king with the ace, he gets the lead and trumps out, and having cleared the board of trumps, his partner returns his lead; and the ace being out, there is room for him to make that whole suit, which could not have been done if the partner had kept the ace. Suppose he has no other good card in his hand besides that suit, he loses nothing by the ace's taking his king; and if it should happen that he has a good card to bring in that suit, he gains all the tricks which he makes to that suit by this method of play: as his partner has taken his king with the ace, and trumps out upon it, he has reason to imagine that his partner has one of that suit to return him; for which reason he should not throw away any of that suit, even to keep a king or queen guarded.\n\nMethod of playing when an honour is turned up on the right hand.\u2014Suppose the knave is turned up on his right hand, and that he has king, queen, and ten; in order to win the knave, he must begin with the king; by which means, his partner may suppose him to have queen and ten remaining, especially if he has a second lead, and he does not proceed to play the queen.\n\nSuppose the knave turned up as before, and he has ace, queen, and ten, by playing his queen, it answers the purpose of the former rule.\n\nWhen the queen is turned up on his right hand, and he has ace, king, and knave, by playing his king, it answers the same purpose of the former rule.\n\nIn case an honour is turned up on his left hand, supposing he should hold no honour, he should play trumps through the honour as soon as he gets the lead; but if he should hold an honour (except the ace), he must be cautious how he plays trumps, because, in case his partner holds no honour, his adversary will play his own game upon him.\n\nMethod of playing the sequences.\u2014The highest in sequences of trumps should be played, unless he has ace, king, and queen; and then he should play the lowest, which informs his partner of the state of his game.\n\nWhen he has king, queen, and knave, and two small ones, which are not trumps, he should begin with the knave, whether he is strong in trumps or not, as he makes way for the whole suit by getting the ace out.\n\nIf he is strong in trumps, and has a sequence of queen, knave, ten, and two small cards of a suit, he should play the highest of his sequence; for if either of the adversaries should trump that suit in the second round, being also strong in trumps, he will make the remainder of that suit, by fetching out the trumps. When he has knave, ten, and nine, and two small cards of a suit, he may play in the like manner.\n\nIf king, queen, and knave, and one small card of any suit, is the case, whether strong in trumps or not, he should play the king; and when there are only four in number, the same method of play should be observed by inferior sequences.\n\nWhen weak in trumps, he should begin by the lowest of the sequence, provided he has five in number, because if his partner has the ace of that suit he will make it. If he has the ace and four small cards of a suit, and weak in trumps, leading from that suit, he should play the ace. When strong in trumps, the game may be played otherwise.\n\nHow to make a flam, or win every trick.\u2014Suppose A and B partners against C and D, and C to deal, A to have the king, knave, and nine, and seven of hearts, which are trumps, a quart-major in spades, a tierce-major in diamonds, and the ace and king of clubs. Then suppose B to have nine spades, two clubs, and two diamonds. Also suppose D to have ace, queen, ten, and eight of trumps, with nine clubs, and C to have five trumps and eight diamonds. A leads a trump, which D wins, and D is to play a club, which his partner C is to trump; C leads a trump, which his partner D wins; D then will lead a club, which C will trump; and C will play a trump, which D will win; and D having the best trump will play it; after which D having seven clubs in his hand, makes them, so that he flams A and B.\n\nHow to play any hand of cards according to the nearest calculations of his partner's holding certain winning cards:\n\n1. That he has not one certain winning card, is 2 to 1\n2. That he has not two certain winning cards, is 17 to 2\n   But it is about 5 to 4 that he has one or both, or 32 to 25\n3. That he has one card out of any three certain winning cards, is about 5 to 2\n4. That he has not three certain winning cards is about 31 to 1, or 681 to 22\n5. That he has not two of them, is about 7 to 2, or 547 to 156.\n6. That he has not one of them, is about 7 to 6, or 378 to 325\n7. That he holds one or two of them, is in his favour about 13 to 6, or 481 to 222\n8. And about 5 to 2 that he holds 1, 2, or all three of them.\n\nThe use of these calculations is for a whist-player to play his cards to the most advantage. For instance,\n\nAs the first calculation is two to one that his partner does not hold one certain winning card.\u2014Suppose then a suit is led, of which the second player has the king and a small one only, he should put on the king, because the odds are in his favour, that the third player cannot win it. For the same reason, when he is second player, and to lead, he should play a king in preference to a queen, because it is two to one the ace does not take it; but it is five to four the queen will be taken by either ace or king, which may be in the third hand.\n\nAccording\nAccording to the second calculation, of its being five to four that his partner holds one certain winning card out of any two: If he has two honours in any suit, he can play to an advantage, knowing it is five to four in favour of his partner's having one of the two honours; and by the same rule, if he is second player, having a queen and one small card, by playing the queen he plays five to four against himself.\n\nIt is obvious, from the third calculation, which proves it to be five to two that his partner has one card out of any three certain winning cards, that he who plays the knave second hand, having but the knave and one small card of the same suit, must play five to two against himself, and discovers his game to a great disadvantage; for which reason, he should play the lowest of any sequence which he may hold in his hand, as the knave, if he has king, queen, and knave; the ten, if he has queen, knave, and ten, &c. By so doing, his partner has an opportunity of judging what card to play in that suit, according to the odds for or against him.\n\nFrom the above calculation, if he has ace, king, and two small trumps, he is entitled to win four tricks out of six, provided he has four winning cards of any suit; or five tricks out of seven, if he has five winning cards of any suit: by playing two rounds of trumps, and taking out eight of them, it is five to two but his partner has a third trump; and if it should be so, he makes the tricks intended.","sp":396,"ep":399},{"h":"WHISTON","t":"WILLIAM, an English divine of great parts, uncommon learning, and of singular character, was born in 1667 at Norton near Twycroft in the county of Leicestershire, where his father was rector. He was admitted of Clarehall, Cambridge, where he pursued his studies, particularly in the mathematics, and commenced tutor; which his ill health at length forced him to decline. Having entered into orders, he became chaplain to Dr More bishop of Norwich in 1694; and in this station he published his first work, entitled A New Theory of the Earth, &c., in which he undertook to prove the Mosaic doctrine of the earth perfectly agreeable to reason and philosophy. This work brought no small reputation to the author. In the beginning of the 18th century he was made Sir Isaac Newton's deputy, and afterwards his successor, in the Lucasian professorship of mathematics; when he resigned a living he had in Suffolk, and went to reside at Cambridge. About this time he published several scientific works, explanatory of the Newtonian philosophy; and he had the honour to be one of the first, if not the very first, who rendered these principles popular and intelligible to the generality of readers. About the year 1710, he was known to have adopted Arian principles, and was forming projects to support and propagate them: among other things, he had translated the Apostolical Constitutions into English, which favoured the Arian doctrine, and which he asserted to be genuine. The consequence was, that he was deprived of his professorship, and banished the university; he nevertheless pursued his scheme, by publishing the next year his Primitive Christianity Revived, 4 vols, 8vo, for which the convocation fell upon him very vehemently. On his expulsion from Cambridge, Mr Whiston settled in London; where, without suffering his zeal to be intimidated, he continued to write, and propagate his Primitive Christianity, with as much ardour as if he had been in the most flourishing circumstances. In 1721, a subscription was made for the support of his family, which amounted to \u00a370l. For though he drew profits from reading astronomical and philosophical lectures, and also from his publications, which were very numerous, yet these of themselves would have been very insufficient: nor, when joined with the benevolence and charity of those who loved and esteemed him for his learning, integrity, and piety, did they prevent his being frequently in great distresses. He continued long a member of the church of England, and regularly frequented its service, though he disapproved of many things in it: but at last he went over to the Baptists, and attended Dr Forster's meeting at Pinner's hall, Broadstreet. Among other performances not specified above, he wrote Memoirs of his own life and writings, which contain some curious particulars.\n\nHe was remarkable for speaking the plainest truths on every occasion, and to persons of every degree. During the year 1725, that he, with Dr Clarke, Dr Berkeley, and others, had the honour to attend Queen Caroline on a certain day of every week, to talk of the progress of science, her majesty one evening took occasion to pay him a just compliment on his truth and integrity, requesting that he would, with his usual plainness, point out to her any fault that he might have observed in her conduct. At first he begged to be excused, adding, that few persons could bear to have their faults plainly told to them, and least of all royal personages, who, from their elevation, are necessarily surrounded by flatterers, to whose lips truth is a stranger. Her majesty replied, that he was to consider her not as a queen, but as a philosopher; and that philosophy is of very little use, if it cannot enable its professors to bear without offence truths necessary to their own improvement. Upon this he told her, that the greatest fault which he had observed in her conduct, was her indecent behaviour in the house of God, which, he assured her, had made very unfavourable impressions on the minds of many persons, who coming to town from distant parts of the country, had gone to the chapel to obtain a sight of her majesty, the king, and the royal family. The queen made no reply; but in about six weeks afterwards renewed her request, that Mr Whiston would point out the most glaring improprieties in her conduct. To this he answered, that he had laid down a maxim, from which he could not deviate, never to point out to any person more than one fault at a time, and never to give a second reproof till he had observed some good consequence to have arisen from the first (A). Much to the queen's honour, she was pleased with this plain-dealing, and continued to think favourably of Mr Whiston. This honest, but whimsical and credulous man, died in 1762, at the advanced age of 95.","sp":399,"ep":399},{"h":"WHITBY","t":"DR DANIEL, a very learned English divine, was born at 1638, and bred at Oxford; where, in 1664, he was elected perpetual fellow of his college.

Immediately after this regular admission into the ministry, Mr Whitefield applied himself to the most extraordinary, the most indefatigable, duties of his character, preaching daily in prisons, fields, and open streets, wherever he thought there would be a likelihood of making profelytes. Having at length made himself universally known in England, he embarked for America, where the tenets of Methodism began to spread very fast under his friends the Wesleyans; and first determined upon the institution of the orphan-house at Georgia, which he afterwards effected. After a long course of peregrination, his fortune increased as his fame extended among his followers, and he erected two very extensive buildings for public worship, under the name of Tabernacles; one in Tottenham-Court Road, and another in Moorfields. Here, with the help of some afflantists, he continued for several years, attended by very crowded congregations, and quitting the kingdom only occasionally. Besides the two tabernacles already mentioned, Mr Whitefield, by being chaplain to the countess dowager of Huntingdon, was connected with two other religious meetings, one at Bath, and the other at Tunbridge, chiefly erected under that lady's patronage.

This gentleman died six months before the birth of our author, who had also the misfortune to be deprived of his mother before he had attained the seventh year of his age. After receiving the first rudiments of school-education, he was sent to the university of St Andrew's; and after the usual course of instruction there, in classical, philosophical, and mathematical learning, he came to Edinburgh, where he entered upon the study of medicine, under those eminent medical teachers, Monro, Rutherford, Sinclair, Plummer, Alison, and Innes. After learning what was to be acquired at this university, in the prosecution of his studies he visited foreign countries; and after attending the most eminent teachers at London, Paris, and Leyden, he had the degree of Doctor of Physic conferred upon him by the university of Rheims in 1736, being then in the 22nd year of his age.\n\nUpon his return to his native country, he had the same honour also conferred upon him by the university of St Andrew's; where he had before obtained, with applause, the degree of Master of Arts.\n\nNot long afterwards, in the year 1737, he was admitted a Licentiate of Medicine by the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh; and the year following he was raised to the rank of a Fellow of the College. From the time of his admission as a licentiate, he entered upon the practice of physic at Edinburgh; and the reputation which he acquired for medical learning, pointed him out as a fit successor for the first vacant chair in the university. Accordingly, when Dr Sinclair, whose eminent medical abilities, and persuasive powers of oratory, had contributed not a little to the rapid advancement of the medical school of Edinburgh, found that those conspicuous talents which he possessed could no longer be exerted in the manner which they once had been, when he enjoyed bodily vigour unimpaired by age and powers of mind unclouded by disease, he resigned his academical appointments in favour of Dr Whytt.\n\nThis admission into the college took place on the 20th of June 1746; and he began his first course of the institutions of medicine at the commencement of the next winter-session. The abilities which he displayed from his academical chair, in no particular disappointed the expectations which had been formed of his lectures. The Latin tongue was the language of the university of Edinburgh; and he both spoke and wrote in Latin with singular propriety, elegance, and perspicuity. At that time the system and sentiments of Dr Boerhaave, which notwithstanding their errors, must challenge the admiration of later ages, were very generally received by the most intelligent physicians in Britain. Dr Whytt had no such idle ardour for novelties as to throw them entirely aside because he could not follow them in every particular. The institutions of Dr Boerhaave, therefore, furnished him with a text for his lectures; and he was no less successful in explaining, illustrating, and establishing the sentiments of the author, when he could freely adopt them, than in refuting them by clear, connected, and decisive arguments, when he had occasion to differ from him. The opinions which he himself propounded, were delivered and enforced with such acuteness of invention, such display of facts and force of argument, as could rarely fail to gain universal assent from his numerous auditors; but free from that self-sufficiency which is ever the offspring of ignorance and conceit, he delivered his conclusions with becoming modesty and diffidence.\n\nFrom the time that he first entered upon an academical appointment, till the year 1756, his prelections were confined to the institutions of medicine alone. But at that period his learned colleague Dr Rutherford, who then filled the practical chair, who had already taught medicine at Edinburgh with universal applause for more than thirty years, and who had been the first to begin the institution of clinical lectures at the Royal Infirmary, found it necessary to retire from the fatiguing duties of an office to which the progress of age rendered him unequal. On this crisis Dr Whytt, Dr Monro, sen. and Dr Cullen, each agreed to take a share in an appointment in which their united exertions promised the highest advantages to the university. By this arrangement students, who had an opportunity of daily witnessing the practice of three such teachers, and of hearing the grounds of that practice explained, could not fail to derive the most solid advantages.\n\nIn these two departments, the institutions of medicine in the university, and the clinical lectures in the Royal Infirmary, Dr Whytt's academical labours were attended with the most beneficial consequences both to the students and to the university. But not long after the period we have last mentioned, his lectures on the former of these subjects underwent a considerable change. About this time the illustrious Gaubius, who had succeeded to the chair of Boerhaave, favoured the world with his Institutiones Pathologicae. This branch of medicine had indeed a place in the text which Dr Whytt formerly followed; but, without detracting from the character of Dr Boerhaave, it may justly be said, that the attention he had bestowed upon it was not equal to its importance. Dr Whytt was sensible of the improved state in which pathology now appeared in the writings of Boerhaave's successor; and he made no delay in availing himself of the advantages which were then afforded.\n\nIn the year 1762, his pathological lectures were entirely new-modelled. Following the publication of Gaubius as a text, he delivered a comment, which was read by every intelligent student with the most unfeigned satisfaction. In these lectures he collected and condensed the fruits of accurate observation and long experience. Enriched by all the opportunities of information\nwhich he had enjoyed, and by all the discernment which he was capable of exerting, they were justly considered as his most finished production.\n\nFor a period of more than twenty years, during which he was justly held in the highest esteem as a lecturer at Edinburgh, it may readily be supposed that the extent of his practice corresponded to his reputation. In fact, he received both the first emoluments, and the highest honours, which could here be obtained. With extensive practice in Edinburgh, he had numerous consultations from other places. His opinion on medical subjects was daily requested by his most eminent contemporaries in every part of Britain. Foreigners of the first distinction, and celebrated physicians in the most remote parts of the British empire, courted an intercourse with him by letter. Besides private testimonies of esteem, many public marks of honour were conferred upon him both at home and abroad. In 1752, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London; in 1761, he was appointed first physician to the king in Scotland; and in 1764, he was chosen president of the Royal College of Physicians at Edinburgh.\n\nBut the fame which Dr Whytt acquired as a practitioner and teacher of medicine, were not a little increased by the information which he communicated to the medical world in different publications. His celebrity as an author was still more extensive than his reputation as a professor.\n\nHis first publication, An Essay on the Vital and other Involuntary Motions of Animals, although it had been begun soon after he had finished his academical course of medical education, did not come from the press till 1753; a period of fifteen years from the time that he had finished his academical course, and obtained a degree in medicine: but the delay of this publication was fully compensated by the matter which it contained, and the improved form under which it appeared.\n\nThe next subject which employed the pen of Dr Whytt was one of a nature more immediately practical. His Essay on the Virtues of Lime-water and Soap in the Cure of the Stone, first made its appearance in a separate volume in 1752. Part of this second work had appeared several years before in the Edinburgh Medical Essays: but it was now presented to the world as a distinct publication with many improvements and additions.\n\nHis third work, intitled Physiological Essays, was first published in the year 1755. This treatise consisted of two parts; 1st, An Inquiry into the Causes which promote the Circulation of the Fluids in the very small Vessels of Animals; and 2ndly, Observations on the Sensibility and Irritability of the Parts of Men and other Animals, occasioned by Dr Haller's treatise on that subject. The former of these may be considered as an extension and farther illustration of the sentiments which he had already delivered in his Essay on the Vital Motions, while the latter was on a subject of a controversial nature. In both he displayed that acuteness of genius and strength of judgement which appeared in his former writings.\n\nFrom the time at which his Physiological Essays were published, several years were probably employed by our author in preparing for the press a larger and perhaps a more important work than any yet mentioned, his Observations on the Nature, Causes, and Cure of those Disorders which are commonly called nervous, hypochondriac, and hysterick. This elaborate and useful work was published in the year 1764.\n\nThe last of Dr Whytt's writings is intitled, Observations on the Dropsy in the Brain. This treatise did not appear till two years after his death; when all his other works were collected and published in one quarto volume, under the direction of his son and of his intimate friend the late Sir John Pringle.\n\nBesides these five works, he wrote many other papers, which appeared in different periodical publications; particularly in the Philosophical Transactions, the Medical Essays, the Medical Observations, and the Physical and Literary Essays.\n\nAt an early period of life, soon after he had settled as a medical practitioner in Edinburgh, he entered into the married state. His first wife was Miss Robertson, sister to General Robertson governor of New York. By her he had two children; both of whom died in early infancy, and their mother did not long survive them. A few years after the death of his first wife, he married as a second wife Miss Balfour, sister to James Balfour, Esq., of Pilrig. By her he had fourteen children; but in these also he was in some respects unfortunate; for six of them only survived him, three sons and three daughters, and of the former two are since dead. Although the feeling heart of Dr Whytt, amidst the distresses of his family, must have often suffered that uneasiness and anxiety which in such circumstances is the unavoidable consequence of parental affection and conjugal love; yet he enjoyed a large share of matrimonial felicity. But his course of happiness was terminated by the death of his wife, which happened in the year 1764; and it is not improbable that this event had some share in hastening his own death; for in the beginning of the year 1765 his health was so far impaired, that he became incapable of his former exertions. A tedious complication of chronic ailments, which chiefly appeared under the form of diabetes, was not to be resisted by all the medical skill which Edinburgh could afford; and at length terminated in death, on the 15th of April 1766, in the 52nd year of his age.","sp":401,"ep":402},{"h":"WIBURGH","t":"a considerable town of Denmark, in North Jutland, with a bishop's see, remarkable for being the seat of the chief court of justice in the province.

He was educated at Oxford, first in Queen's and afterwards in Merton college, of which he was a probationer-fellow. Having acquired the reputation of a man of great learning and abilities, in 1361 he was chosen master of Balliol-hall, and in 1365 constituted warden of Canterbury college, by the founder Archbishop Simon de Ilip; but in 1367, he was ejected by the regulars, together with three secular fellows. He thought their proceedings arbitrary, and therefore appealed to the pope; but instead of obtaining redress, the ejectment was confirmed in 1370. This disappointment probably contributed somewhat towards his enmity to the see of Rome, or rather to confirm that enmity; for he had long before written against the pope's exactions and corruptions of religion. However, his credit in the university continued; for having taken the degree of doctor in divinity, he read public lectures with great applause; in which he frequently exposed the impositions of the Mendicant friars. About this time he published a defence of his sovereign Edward III., against the pope, who had insisted on the homage to which his predecessor King John had agreed. This defence was the cause of Wickliff's introduction at court, and of his being sent one of the ambassadors in 1374 to Bruges, where they met the pope's nuncios, in order to settle several ecclesiastical matters relative to the pope's authority. In the mean time Wickliff was presented by the king to the rectory of Lutterworth in Leicestershire, and in 1375 he obtained a prebend in the church of Westbury in Gloucestershire. Wickliff continued hither-to, without molestation, to oppose the papal authority; but in 1377 a bull was sent over to the archbishop of Canterbury, and to Courtney bishop of London, ordering them to secure this arch-heretic, and lay him in irons; at the same time the pope wrote to the king, requesting him to favour the bishops in the prosecution; he also sent a bull to Oxford, commanding the university to give him up. Before these bulls reached England Edward III. was dead; and Wickliff, protected by John duke of Lancaster, uncle to Richard II. favoured by the queen-mother, and supported by the citizens of London, eluded the persecution of Pope Gregory IX., who died in 1378. In the following year this intrepid reformer presented to parliament a severe paper against the tyranny of Rome, wrote against the papal supremacy and infallibility, and published a book On the Truth of the Scriptures, intended to prepare the way for an English translation of them, in which he had made considerable progress. In 1381 he published Sixteen Conclusions; in the first of which he ventured to expose the grand article of transubstantiation. These conclusions being condemned by the chancellor of Oxford, Wickliff appealed to the king and parliament; but being deserted by his unsteady patron the duke of Lancaster, he was obliged to make a confession at Oxford; and by an order from the king was expelled the university. He now retired to his living of Lutterworth, where he finished his translation of the bible. This version, of which there are several manuscript copies in the libraries of the universities, British Museum, &c., is a very literal translation from the Latin vulgate. In 1383 he was suddenly struck with the palsy; a repetition of which put an end to his life in December 1384. He was buried in his own church, where his bones were suffered to rest in peace till the year 1428, when, by an order from the pope, they were taken up and burnt.\u2014Besides a number of works that have been printed, he left a prodigious number of manuscripts; an accurate list of which may be seen in Bishop Tanner's Bib. Brit. Hib. Some of them are in the Bodleian Library, others in the British Museum, &c.\n\nWickliff was doubtless a very extraordinary man, considering the times in which he lived. His natural sagacity discovered the absurdities and impositions of the church of Rome, and he had the honesty and resolution to promulgate his opinions, which a little more support would probably have enabled him to establish; they were evidently the foundation of the subsequent reformation.","sp":402,"ep":403},{"h":"WICKLOW","t":"a county of Ireland, in the province of Leinster; bounded on the north by the county of Dublin; on the east by the Irish sea; on the south by Wexford; and on the west by Kildare and Catherlough.

As to the situation of wildernesses, they should never be placed too near the habitation, nor so as to obstruct any distant prospect of the country, there being nothing so agreeable as an unconfined prospect; but where, from the situation of the place, the light is confined within the limits of the garden, nothing can so agreeably terminate the prospect as a beautiful scene of the various kinds of trees judiciously planted; and if it is so contrived that the termination is planted circularly, with the concave towards the flight, it will have a much better effect than if it end in straight lines or angles. The plants should always be adapted to the size of the plantation; for it is very absurd for tall trees to be planted in the small squares of a little garden; and in large designs small shrubs will have a mean appearance. It should also be observed never to plant evergreens amongst deciduous trees; but always to place the evergreens in a separate part by themselves, and that chiefly in flight.\n\nAs to the walks, those that have the appearance of meanders, where the eye cannot discover more than twenty or thirty yards in length, are generally preferable to all others, and these should now and then lead into an open circular piece of grass; in the centre of which may be placed either an obelisk, statue, or fountain; and if in the middle of the wilderness there be contrived a large opening, in the centre of which may be erected a dome or banqueting house, surrounded with a green plot of grass, it will be a considerable addition to the beauty of the whole. From the sides of the walks and openings, the trees should rise gradually one above another to the middle of the quarters; where should always be planted the largest growing trees, so that the heads of all the trees may appear to view, while their stems will be hid from the sight. Thus, in those parts which are planted with deciduous trees, roses, honeyfuckles, spirea frutex, and other kinds of low flowering shrubs, may be planted next the walks and openings; and at their feet, near the sides of the walks, may be planted primroses, violets, daffodils, &c., not in a straight line, but so as to appear accidental, as in a natural wood. Behind these may be placed laurels, hollies, arbutus, and other evergreens of a larger growth. Next to these may be planted alaternus, phyllireas, yews, cypresses, Virginia cedars, and other trees of the same growth; behind these may be planted Norway and silver firs, the true pine, and other sorts of the fir growth; and in the middle should be planted Scotch pines, pinaster, and other sorts of the larger growing evergreens;\nevergreens; which will afford a most delightful prospect if the different shades of the greens are curiously intermixed.\n\nBut beside the grand walks and openings (which should always be laid with turf, and kept well mowed), there should be some smaller serpentine walks through the middle of the quarters, where persons may retire for privacy; and by the sides of these private walks may also be scattered some wood-flowers and plants; which, if artfully planted, will have a very good effect.\n\nIn the general design these wildernesses, there should not be a studied and stiff correspondence between the several parts; for the greater diversity there is in the distribution of them, the more pleasure they will afford.","sp":404,"ep":405},{"h":"WILKIE","t":"WILLIAM, D.D., author of a heroic poem called the Epigoniad, was born in the parish of Dalmeny in West Lothian in Scotland, in October 1721. His father was a small farmer, and was not very fortunate in his worldly affairs. He gave his son, however, a liberal education, the early part of which he received at the parish school of Dalmeny, and at the age of 13 he was sent to the university of Edinburgh, where he was soon distinguished as a young man of genius. Among his fellow-students were Dr Robertson the historian, Mr Home the poet, and some other eminent literary characters. He became acquainted also, in the course of his education, with David Hume and Dr Adam Ferguson.\n\nBefore he completed his studies at the university, his father died, leaving him only the stock and unexpired lease of his farm, with the care of three sisters, one of whom being afterwards married to an experienced farmer, Wilkie availed himself of his practical knowledge. He formed a system of farming which fully answered his own expectations, and secured to him the approbation of all his neighbours. After becoming a preacher in the church of Scotland, he still continued his former mode of living, cultivating his farm, reading the classics, and occasionally preaching for the ministers in the neighbourhood. In 1753, he was presented to the church of Ratho by the earl of Lauderdale, who was sensible of his worth, and admired his genius. The duties of his new office he discharged with fidelity, and was celebrated for his impressive mode of preaching, while he did not neglect the amusements of husbandry, and the study of the belles lettres. He published his Epigoniad in the year 1757, the result of fourteen years study, and a second edition of it was called for in 1759, in which year he was chosen professor of natural philosophy in the university of St Andrews. His whole fortune, when he removed to this place, did not exceed \u00a3200, which he laid out in the purchase of a few acres of land in the vicinity of the city. He lived in the university in the same studious and retired manner as he had done at Ratho. In the year 1768 he published a volume of fables of no great celebrity, prior to which the university conferred on him the degree of D.D. He died, after a lingering illness, on the 10th of October 1772.\n\nThe manners of Dr Wilkie were in many respects very singular, and in some quite disgusting. For the purpose of promoting perspiration, and thus removing an aguish complaint, with which he had been seized during his residence at Ratho, he generally slept in winter under no fewer than 24 blankets. His aversion to clean linen is altogether unaccountable. It is said that when he slept from home, he not only stipulated for the proper quantity of blankets, but requested to be indulged with sheets which had been previously used by some other person. It is scarcely necessary to add, that his dress was slovenly in the extreme. It is somewhat remarkable, that Dr Wilkie never could read aloud the smoothest verse in such a manner as to preserve either the measure or the sense, although his own compositions in verse are greatly distinguished by their smoothness and elegance.\n\nIt is said that Dr Wilkie, from having studied Homer with great attention, was led to project an epic poem on the model of that ancient poet. The subject of it is drawn from the fourth book of the Iliad, where Thetis gives Agamemnon a short account of the taking of Thebes; and as that city was taken by the sons of those who had fallen before it, our author gave to his poem the title of Epigoniad, from the Greek word \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, signifying descendants. This title, it is supposed, is not very appropriate, and is not altogether free from quaintness. The subject of the poem has not been selected with much judgement; for the learned reader will prefer studying the manners and actions of ancient heroes in the sublime descriptions of Homer and Virgil, and others will be little interested in scenes and characters so different from those with which they are familiar, and so far removed from their own times. Accordingly, the Epigoniad, with all its merit as an epic poem (and it is not destitute of many of the essential requisites of that species of poetical composition), is now little known.","sp":405,"ep":405},{"h":"WILKINS","t":"DR JOHN, a most ingenious and learned English bishop, was the son of a goldsmith of Oxford, and was born in 1644.

Richard Cromwell made him master of Trinity college, Cambridge, from which he was ejected on the Restoration. He then became preacher to Gray's-Inn, rector of St Lawrence Jewry, London, dean of Rippon, and in 1688 was promoted to the bishopric of Chester. He died in 1672. Bishop Wilkins thought it prudent to submit to the powers in being; he therefore subscribed to the solemn league and covenant while it was enforced, and was equally ready to swear allegiance to King Charles when he was restored: this, with his moderate spirit toward dissenters, rendered him not very agreeable to churchmen.

According to Bale and Pits, he was surnamed Somerestius, from the county in which he was born. From his own preface to his second book De Regibus Anglorum, it appears that he was addicted to learning from his youth; that he applied himself to the study of logic, physic, ethics, and particularly to history. He retired to the Benedictine convent at Malmesbury, became a monk, and was made precentor and librarian; a situation which much favoured his intention of writing the history of this kingdom. In this monastery he spent the remainder of his life, and died in the year 1142. He is one of our most ancient and most faithful historians. His capital work is that intitled De Regibus Anglorum, in five books; with an Appendix, which he styles Historiae Novelle, in two more. It is a judicious collection of whatever he found on record relative to England, from the invasion of the Saxons to his own times.\n\nWilliam of Newbury, so called from a monastery in Yorkshire, of which he was a member, wrote a history which begins at the Conquest and ends at the year 1197. His Latin style is preferred to that of Matthew Paris; and he is entitled to particular praise, for his honest regard to truth, in treating the fables of Jeffery of Monmouth with the contempt they deserve; as well as for expressing his approbation of Henry II.'s design of reforming the clergy, by bringing them under the regulation of the secular power.\n\nWilliam of Wykeham, bishop of Winchester, was born in the village of Wykeham, in the county of Southampton, in 1324. He was educated at Winchester and Oxford; and having continued near six years in the university, his patron Nicholas Wedal, governor of the province of Southampton, took him into his family, and appointed him his counsellor and secretary. He could not have made choice of a fitter person for that employment, no man in that age writing or speaking more politely than Wykeham. For this reason Edington, bishop of Winchester, lord high-treasurer of the kingdom, appointed him his secretary three years after, and also recommended him to King Edward III., who took him into his service. Being skilled in geometry and architecture, he was appointed surveyor of the royal buildings, and also chief justice in eyre: he superintended the building of Windsor-castle. He was afterward chief secretary of state, a keeper of the privy seal; and in 1367 succeeded Edington in the see of Winchester. A little after he was appointed lord high-chancellor and president of the privy-council. That he might well discharge the several functions of his employments, both ecclesiastical and civil, he endeavoured, on one hand, to regulate his own life according to the strictest maxims, and to promote such parish-priests only as were able to give due instructions to their parishioners, and at the same time led exemplary lives: on the other hand, he did all in his power to cause justice to be impartially administered. In 1371 he resigned his William, chancellorship, and some time after the great seal. Edward returning to England, after having carried on a very successful war in France, found his exchequer in great disorder. The duke of Lancaster, one of his sons, at the head of several lords, having brought complaints against the clergy, who then enjoyed the chief places in the kingdom, the king removed them from their employments. But the laymen, who were raised to them, behaved so ill, that the king was forced to re\u00eblect the ecclesiastics. The duke of Lancaster showed strong animosity to the clergy, and set every engine at work to ruin Wykeham. He impeached him of extortion, and of defrauding things, and obliged him to appear at the King's bench. He got such judges appointed as condemned him; and not satisfied with depriving him of all the temporalities of his bishopric, he advised Edward to banish him: but this prince rejected the proposal, and afterward restored to Wykeham all that he had been divested of. Richard II. was but eleven years old when Edward died; so that the duke of Lancaster had an easy opportunity of reviving the accusations against the bishop of Winchester; nevertheless Wykeham cleared himself. Then he founded two noble colleges, the one in Oxford, the other in Winchester. Whilst he was exerting his utmost endeavours to improve these two fine foundations, he was recalled to court, and in a manner forced to accept of the office of lord high-chancellor in 1389.\u2014Having excellently discharged the duties of that employment for three years, he obtained leave to resign it, foreseeing the disturbances that were going to break out. Being returned to his church, he finished his college, and built there so magnificent a cathedral, that it almost equals that of St Paul's in London. He laid out several sums in things advantageous to the public and to the poor; notwithstanding which, in 1397 he was in great danger; for he and some others were impeached of high-treason in open parliament: however, he was again fully cleared. From that time till his death he kept quiet in his diocese, and there employed himself in all the duties of a good prelate. He died in 1404, in the 81st year of his age.\n\nWilliam, the name of several kings of England.

Fort William is of a triangular form; having two bastions, and is capable of admitting a garrison of 800 men; but could not be defended against an attack, as it is commanded by several hills in the neighbourhood.\n\nWilliam's Fort, is a factory of Asia belonging to the East-India Company, seated on one of the branches of the river Ganges, in the kingdom of Bengal. The fort was first built in the shape of an irregular tetragon of brick and mortar; and the town has nothing regular in it, because every one built a house as he liked best, and for his own convenience. The governor's house is within the fort, and is the best piece of architecture in these parts. Here there are also convenient lodgings for the factors and writers, with store-houses for the company's\ncompany's goods, and magazines for ammunition. About 50 yards from the fort is the church, which was originally built by the merchants. The town of Calcutta is contiguous, containing 50,000 inhabitants.\n\nIt is governed by a mayor and aldermen, as most of the company's factories in the East Indies now are. In 1737 it was surprized by the nabob of Bengal, who took it, and put most of those that had made resistance into a place called the Black-Hole, where the greater number was suffocated.

The garrison of Oxford at length surrendering to the parliament, he applied himself to the practice of his profession; and soon rendered himself famous by his care and skill. He appropriated a room as an oratory for divine service according to the church of England, whither most of the loyalists in Oxford daily resorted. In 1662, he became Sedleian professor of natural philosophy, and the same year took the degree of doctor of physic. In 1664, he discovered the famous medicinal spring at Altropp, near Brackley. He was one of the first members of the Royal Society, and soon made his name illustrious by his excellent writings. In 1666, after the fire of London, he removed to Westminster; and his practice became greater than that of any of the physicians his contemporaries. Soon after his settlement in London, his only son Thomas falling into a consumption, he sent him to Montpelier in France for the recovery of his health; and it proved successful. His wife also labouring under the same disorder, he offered to leave the town; but she, not suffering him to neglect the means of providing for his family, died in 1670.

But to the history of animals, which was in a great measure neglected by his countrymen, he particularly applied himself; and for this purpose carefully read over what had been written on that subject by others. He then travelled several times over his native country; and afterwards into France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and the Low Countries, attended by his ingenious friend Mr John Ray. It is remarkable, that notwithstanding the advantages of birth, fortune, and parts, he was as humble as any man of the meanest fortune; was sober, temperate, and chaste; scrupulously just; so true to his word and promise, that a man might venture his estate and life upon it; so faithful and constant to his friend, as never to desert him when fortune frowned upon him; and remarkably pious, patient, and submissive to the divine will.

He was taught grammar and classical learning at the free-school at Burford;\nwhere he obtained a quick relish of the beauties of the Latin tongue, and afterwards became well versed in the authors of the Augustan age. In 1659, he was admitted a nobleman of Wadham college, where he obtained the degree of master of arts. He afterwards travelled through France and Italy; and at his return was made one of the gentlemen of the bedchamber to the king, and comptroller of Woodstock Park. In 1665, he went to sea, and was in the Revenge, commanded by Sir Thomas Tiddiman, when an attack was made on the port of Bergen in Norway: during the whole action he showed the greatest resolution, and gained a high reputation for courage; which he supported in a second expedition, but afterwards lost it in a private adventure with Lord Mulgrave.\n\nBefore the earl of Rochester travelled, he had indulged in the most disorderly and intemperate way of living; at his return, however, he seemed to have got the better of it entirely. But falling into the company of the courtiers, who continually practised these excesses, he became so sunk in debauchery, that he was for five years together so given up to drinking, that during all that time he was never cool enough to be master of himself. His violent love of pleasure, and his disposition to extravagant mirth, carried him to great excesses. The first involved him in sensuality, and the other led him into many adventures and ridiculous frolics. Once disguising himself so that he could not be known by his nearest friends, he set up in Tower-street for an Italian mountebank, and there dispersed his nostrums for some weeks. He often disguised himself as a porter, or as a beggar, sometimes to follow a mean amour; at other times, he would go about merely for diversion, in odd shapes; and acted his part so naturally, that he could not be known even by his friends. In short, by his constant indulgence in wine, women, and irregular frolics, he entirely wore out an excellent constitution before he was 30 years of age. In October 1679, when recovering from a violent disease, which ended in a consumption, he was visited by Dr Burnet, upon an intimation that such a visit would be agreeable to him. Dr Burnet published an account of his conferences with Lord Rochester; in which it appears, that though he had lived the life of a libertine and atheist, yet he died the death of a penitent Christian. His death happened in 1680; since which time his poems have been various times printed, both separately and together; but when once he obtained the character of a lewd and obscene writer, every thing in that strain was ascribed to him; and thus many pieces not of his writing have crept into the later editions of his works. The author of the Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors says, he was \"a man whom the Muses were fond to inspire, and ashamed to avow, and who practised without the least reserve that secret which can make verses more read for their defects than their merits.\" Lord Rochester's Poems have much more obscenity than wit, more wit than poetry, and more poetry than politeness.\" His writings, besides those already mentioned, are, A Satire against Mankind; Nothing, a poem; Valentinian, a tragedy; Fifty-four Letters to Henry Savile, and others; Seven more to his Wife and Son; a Letter on his deathbed to Dr Burnet. He also left behind him several other papers, and a History of the Intrigues of the Court of Charles II.; but his mother, a very devout lady, ordered all his papers to be burned.","sp":407,"ep":408},{"h":"WILSON","t":"FLORENCE, known in the republic of letters by the name of Florentius Voluphimus, was born at Elgin in the shire of Murray in Scotland, and educated in the university of Aberdeen. Travelling to England with an intention to improve his fortune, he had the facility to be introduced to Cardinal Wolsey, who appointed him tutor to one of his nephews. In that capacity he went to Paris, and continued there till the cardinal's death. During his residence in that city he became acquainted with the learned Cardinal Bellai, archbishop of Paris, who allowed him a pension, and meant to have appointed him royal professor of the Greek and Latin languages in the university of Paris; but Bellai being disgraced, Wilson's prospects faded with the fortunes of his patron, whom nevertheless he attended on his journey to Rome. Wilson was taken ill at Avignon, and the cardinal proceeded without him. After his recovery, he paid a visit to the celebrated Cardinal Sabolet, the Mecenas of his time, who was also bishop of Carpentras, where he then resided. The cardinal was so charmed with his erudition, that he appointed him professor of the learned languages, with a stipend of 100 pilotes per annum.\n\nDuring his residence at Carpentras, he wrote his celebrated treatise De Animi Tranquillitate. Mackenzie says that he afterwards taught philosophy in Italy; and that, being at length desirous of returning to Scotland, he began his journey homeward, was taken ill at Vienne Dauphiny, and died there in the year 1547.

He received the rudiments of his education at the county town, and from thence was removed to the university of Dublin. His allowance at the university was 20l. a-year; a sum, small as it may now appear, which was in those days sufficient for a sober youth in so cheap a country as Ireland.\n\nHis first intention was to have applied to the study of physic; but from this he was diverted by Archdeacon Hewetson, by whose advice he dedicated himself to the church. He continued at college till the year 1686, when, on the 29th of June, he was ordained deacon.\n\nThe exact time of Mr Wilson's leaving Dublin is not known; but on account of the political and religious disputes of those days, it was sooner than he intended. On the 10th of December, in the same year, he was licensed to the curacy of New Church in Winwick, of which Dr Sherlock, his maternal uncle, was rector. His stipend was no more than 30l. a-year; but being an excellent economist, and having the advantage of living with his uncle, this small income was not only sufficient to supply his own wants, but it enabled him to supply the wants of others; and for this purpose he set apart one-tenth of his income. In 1692 he was appointed domestic chaplain to William earl of Derby, and tutor to his son James Lord Strange, with a salary of\nWilton of \u00a330l. a-year. He was soon after elected master of the alms-house at Latham, which brought him in \u00a320l. a-year more. Having now an income far beyond his expectations, or his wishes, except as it increased his ability to do good, he set apart one-fifth of his income for pious uses, and particularly for the poor. In short, as his income increased, he increased the portion of it which was allotted to the purposes of charity. At first he set apart a tenth, then a fifth, afterwards a third, and lastly, when he became a bishop, he dedicated the full half of his revenues to pious and charitable uses.\n\nHe had not been long in the service of Lord Derby, before he was offered the valuable living of Buddleworth in Yorkshire; which he refused to accept, as being inconsistent with the resolves of his conscience against non-residence, Lord Derby choosing still to retain him as chaplain and tutor to his son. In 1697 he was promoted, not without some degree of compulsion on the part of his patron, to the bishopric of the Isle of Man; a preferment which he held 58 years. In 1698 he married Mary, daughter of Thomas Patten, Esq., of Warrington. By this lady, who survived her marriage about six years, he had four children; none of whom survived him except the late Dr Wilton, prebendary of Wellsminster.\n\n\"The annual receipts of the bishopric (says the author of his memoirs) did not exceed \u00a3300l. in money. Some necessaries in his house, as spices, sugar, wine, books, &c., must be paid for with money; distrefted or shipwrecked mariners, and some other poor objects, required to be relieved with money; but the poor of the island were fed and clothed, and the house in general supplied from his demesnes, by exchange, without money. The poor, who could weave or spin, found the best market at Bishop's-court, where they bartered the produce of their labour for corn. Tailors and shoemakers were kept in the house constantly employed, to make into garments or shoes that cloth or leather which his corn had purchased; and the aged and infirm were supplied according to their several wants. Mr Moore of Douglas informed the editor, that he was once witness to a pleasing and singular instance of the Bishop's attention to some aged poor of the island. As he was distributing spectacles to some whose eyesight failed them, Mr Moore expressed his surprife, as he well knew not one of them could read a letter. 'No matter,' said the Bishop with a smile, 'they will find use enough for them; these spectacles will help them to thread a needle, to mend their clothes, or, if need be, to keep themselves free from vermin.'\n\nSo great was the bishop's attachment to his flock, that no temptation could seduce him from their service. He more than once refused the offer of an English bishopric. There is an anecdote of his lordship and Cardinal Fleury, which does great credit to them both. The cardinal wanted much to see him, and sent over on purpose to inquire after his health, his age, and the date of his consecration, as they were the two oldest bishops, and he believed the poorest, in Europe; at the same time inviting him to France. The bishop sent the cardinal an answer, which gave him so high an opinion of him, that the cardinal obtained an order that no French privateer should ravage the isle of Man.\n\nThis good prelate lived till the year 1755, dying at the advanced age of 93.

Some of the first converts to Christianity are supposed to have lived here. In the castle, near the west gate, many of the Saxon kings anciently kept their court. The cathedral was founded by Kenegulfe, a king of the Mercians; but there were many Christians, and places for their worship here, long before that period.

This wonderful man, to all appearance destined by his birth to superintend a little school in an obscure town of Germany, raised himself to the office of president of antiquities in the Vatican. After having been seven years professor in the college of Seehaufen near Salzwedel, he went into Saxony, where he resided seven years more, and was librarian to Count Bunau at Nothenitz. When he left this place, 1754, he went to Dresden, where he formed an acquaintance with the ablest artists, and particularly with M. Oester, an excellent painter, and one of the best draughtsmen of the age. In that year he abjured Wincklemanism, and embraced the Roman Catholic religion. In September 1755, he set out for Italy, and arrived at Rome in December following. His principal object was to see the Vatican library, and to examine the ruins of Herculaneum.\n\nMr Winckleman carried with him into Italy a sense of beauty and art, which led him instantly to admire the masterpieces of the Vatican, and with which he began to study them. He soon increased his knowledge; and it was not till after he had thus purified his taste and conceived an idea of ideal beauty, which led him into the greatest secrets of art, that he began to think of the explanation of other monuments, in which his great learning could not fail to distinguish him. His erudition enabled him to fill up his principal plan of writing the \"History of Art.\" In 1756 he planned his \"Restoration of Ancient Statues,\" and a larger work on the Taste of the Greek Artists; and designed an account of the galleries of Rome and Italy, beginning with a volume on the Belvedere statues, in the manner of Richardson, who, he says, only ran over Rome. He also intended a history of the corruption of taste in art, the restoration of statues, and an illustration of the obscure points of mythology. All these different essays led him to his \"History of Art,\" and his \"Monumenti Inediti.\" It must, however, be confessed, that the first of these works has not all the clearness and precision that might be expected in its general plan and division of its parts and objects; but it has enlarged and extended the ideas both of antiquaries and collectors. The description of the gems and sulphurs of the Stolz cabinet contributed not a little to extend Mr Winckleman's knowledge. Few persons have opportunities of contemplating such vast collections. The engravings of Lippet and Count Caylus are all that many can arrive at. Mr Winckleman's Monumenti Inediti, of which he had begun the third volume 1767, seem to have secured him the esteem of antiquaries. Had he lived, we should have had a work long wished for; a complete collection of the bas-reliefs discovered from the time of Bartoli to the present, the greater part of which are in the possession of Cardinal Albani.\n\nWhen Cardinal Albani succeeded to the place of librarian of the Vatican, he endeavoured to get a place for the Hebrew language for Winckleman, who refused a canonry, because he would not take the tonsure. The elector of Saxony gave him, 1761, un solicited, the place of Counsellor Richter, the direction of the royal cabinet of medals and antiquities at Dresden. Upon the death of the abb\u00e9 Venuti, 1762, he was appointed president of the antiquities of the apostolic-chamber, with power over all discoveries and exportations of antiquities and pictures. This is a post of honour, with an income of 160 feudi per annum. He had a prospect of the place of president of antiquities in the Vatican, going to be created at 16 feudi per month, and was named corresponding member of the Academy of Inscriptions. The king of Prussia offered him, by Col. Quintus Icilius, the place of librarian and director of his cabinet of medals and antiquities, void by the death of M. Gautier de la Croze, with a handsome appointment. He made no scruple of accepting the offer; but when it came to the pope's ears, he added an appointment out of his own purse, and kept him at Rome.\nIn April 1768, he left Rome to go with M. Cava-\nceppi over Germany and Switzerland. When he came\nto Vienna, he was so pleased with the reception he met\nwith, that he made a longer stay there than he had in-\ntended. But, being suddenly seized with a secret un-\neasiness and extraordinary desire to return to Rome, he\nset out for Italy, putting off his visits to his friends in\nGermany to a future opportunity. As he passed through\nTrieste, he was affiliated, June 8, 1768, by a wretch\nnamed Arcangeli, a native of Campiglio, a town in the\nterritory of Pioltola, with whom he had made an ac-\nquaintance on the road. This miscreant had been con-\ndemned for a robbery to work in letters four years, and\nthen to be banished the Austrian territories, on an oath\nnever to return. He had obtained a mitigation of one\nof his sentences, and retired to Venice; but, chang-\ning his quarters backwards and forwards, he was so re-\nduced in circumstances that he at length took up his\nlodgings at the inn to which the Abb\u00e9 happened to come.\nArcangeli paid such affidavit court to him, that\nhe entirely gained his confidence; and having been fa-\nvoured with a sight of the valuable presents which he\nhad received at Vienna, formed a design to murder and\nrob him. He bought a new sharp knife on purpose;\nand as the Abb\u00e9 (who had in the most friendly manner\ninvited him to Rome) was sitting down in his chair, ear-\nly in the morning, he threw a rope over his head, and\nbefore he could disengage himself, stabbed him in five\ndifferent places. The Abb\u00e9 had still strength to get\ndown to the ground floor, and call for help; and being\nlaid on a bed in the midst of the most violent pain, he\nhad composition sufficient to receive the last sacraments,\nand to make his will, in which he appointed Cardinal\nAlexander Albani his residuary legatee, and expired in\nthe afternoon. The murderer was soon after appre-\nhended; and executed on the wheel opposite the inn,\nJune 26.\n\nAbb\u00e9 Winckleman was a middle-sized man; he had\na very low forehead, sharp nose, and little black hollow\neyes, which gave him an aspect rather gloomy than\notherwise. If he had any thing graceful in his physiog-\nnomy, it was his mouth. A fiery and impetuous dispo-\nsition often threw him into extremes. Naturally enthu-\nsiastic, he often indulged an extravagant imagination;\nbut as he possessed a strong and solid judgement, he knew\nhow to give things a just and intrinsic value. In conse-\nquence of this turn of mind, as well as a neglected educa-\ntion, a cautious reserve was a quality he little knew. If\nhe was bold in his decisions as an author, he was still\nmore so in his conversation, and has often made his\nfriends tremble for his temerity. If ever man knew\nwhat friendship was, that man was Mr Winckleman,\nwho regularly practised all his duties; and for this rea-\nson he could boast of having friends among persons of\nevery rank and condition.\n\nWIND is a sensible agitation of the atmosphere, oc-\ncasioned by a quantity of air flowing from one place to\nanother.

A very great number of vegetable substances may be made to afford wine, as grapes, currants, mulberries, elders, cherries, apples, pulse, beans, peas, turnips, radishes, and even grass itself. Hence, under the clasps of wines or vinous liquors, come not only wines, absolutely so called, but also ale, cyder, &c.\n\nWine, however, is in a more particular manner appropriated to the liquor drawn from the fruit of the vine. The process of making wine is as follows: When the grapes are ripe, and the saccharine principle is developed, they are then pressed, and the juice which flows out is received in vessels of a proper capacity, in which the fermentation appears, and proceeds in the following manner: At the end of several days, and frequently after a few hours, according to the heat of the atmosphere, the nature of the grapes, the quantity of the liquid, and temperature of the place in which the operation is performed, a movement is produced in the liquor, which continually increases; the volume of the fluid increases; it becomes turbid and oily; carbonic acid is discharged, which fills all the unoccupied part of the vessel, and the temperature rises to the 72.5th degree. At the end of several days these tumultuous motions subside, the mists falls, the liquid becomes clearer, and is found to be less saccharine, more odorant, and of a red colour, from the reaction of the ardent spirit upon the colouring matter of pellicle of the grape.\n\nThe wine is usually taken out of the fermenting vessels at the period when all the phenomena of fermentation have subsided. When the mists is settled, the colour of the liquor is well developed, when it has become clear, and its heat has disappeared; it is put into casks, where, by a second infensible fermentation, the wine is clarified, its principles combine more perfectly together, and its taste and smell become more and more developed. If this fermentation be stopped or suffocated, the gaseous principles are retained, and the wine is brisker, and more of the nature of must.\n\nIt appears, from the interesting experiments of the Marquis de Bullion, that the vinous fermentation does not take place unless tartar be present.\n\nThe causes of imperfect fermentation are the following: 1. If the heat be too little, the fermentation imperceptibly languishes, the saccharine and oily matters are not sufficiently elaborated, and the wine is insipid and sweet. 2. If the saccharine body be not sufficiently abundant, as happens in rainy seasons, the wine is weak, and the mucilage, which predominates, causes it to become sour by its decomposition. 3. If the juice be too watery, concentrated and boiling must is added. 4. If the saccharine principle be not sufficiently abundant, the defect may be remedied by the addition of sugar. Macquer has proved that excellent wine may be made of verjuice and sugar; and M. de Bullion has made wine at Bellejames, with the verjuice of his vine rows and moist sugar.\n\nThere have been many disputes to determine whether grapes should be pressed with the stalks or without. This depends on the nature of the fruit. When they are highly charged with saccharine and mucilaginous matter, the stalk corrects the insipidity of the wine by its bitter principle; but when, on the contrary, the juice is not too sweet, the stalk renders it drier, and very rough.\n\nThe colouring principle of wine is of a resinous nature, and is contained in the pellicle of the grape; and matter of the fluid is not coloured until the wine is formed; for wine, until then there is nothing which can dissolve it: and hence it is that white wine may be made of red grapes, when the juice of the grape is expressed, and the husk thrown away. If wine be evaporated, the colouring principle remains in the residue, and may be extracted by spirit of wine. Old wines lose their colour; a pellicle being precipitated, which is either deposited on the sides of the bottles, or falls to the bottom. If wine be exposed to the heat of the sun during the summer, the colouring matter is detached in a pellicle, which falls to the bottom; when the vessel is opened, the discolouring...\nThe vinous fermentation has been examined with great accuracy by M. Lavoisier. According to him, the vegetable juice of which wine is to be made consists of oxygen, hydrogen, and carbone, combined with one another in different proportions, so as to form chiefly water and sugar. The fermentation produces a separation of the elements, and a new combination of them; a quantity of the oxygen and carbone combine and fly off in the state of carbonic acid; part of the carbone, oxygen, and hydrogen, combine first with each other, and then all together, to form alcohol; another part forms acetic acid; the water still remains, and a residuum falls to the bottom composed of the three elements combined in other proportions.\n\nThe different kinds of wines produced in Europe and other parts of the world are many; the principal of them and their qualities are well known: a catalogue of them would serve no purpose here. We shall, however, subjoin a table of the quantities of the ingredients of the principal kinds from Neumann's Chemistry.\n\n| A quart of | Highly rectified Spirit | Thick, oily, unctuous, resinous matter | Gummy and tartarous matter | Water |\n|------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------|\n| Aland      | 1 6 0 0 3 2 0          | 1 5 0 0 2 5 3 0                    |                          |       |\n| Alicante   | 3 6 0 0 6 0 2 0        | 1 4 0 2 2 0 6 0                    |                          |       |\n| Burgundy   | 2 2 0 0 4 0            | 1 4 0 2 9 0 2 0                    |                          |       |\n| Carcassonne| 2 6 0 0 4 1 0          | 1 2 0 2 8 4 3 0                   |                          |       |\n| Champagne  | 2 5 0 0 5 4 0          | 1 0 0 2 8 3 0                     |                          |       |\n| French     | 3 0 0 0 6 4 0          | 1 0 0 2 8 0 2                     |                          |       |\n| Frontignac | 3 0 0 0 3 4 0          | 5 2 0 4 6 3 0                     |                          |       |\n| Vin Grave  | 2 0 0 0 6 0 0          | 2 0 0 2 9 0 0                     |                          |       |\n| Hermitage  | 2 7 0 0 1 2 0          | 1 4 0 2 7 5 2 0                   |                          |       |\n| Madeira    | 2 3 0 0 3 2 0          | 2 0 0 2 4 3 0                     |                          |       |\n| Malmsey    | 4 0 0 0 4 3 0          | 2 3 0 2 1 2 0                     |                          |       |\n| Vino de Monte | 2 6 0 0 3 0 0 2 4 0 2 | 8 0 2 0                         |                          |       |\n| Pulciano   | 2 2 0 0 4 2 0          | 1 3 0 2 9 0 1 0                  |                          |       |\n| Mofelle    | 3 0 0 0 4 0 0 1 0      | 2 5 0 2 5 4 0                     |                          |       |\n| Mufcadine  | 3 2 0 0 4 0 0 1 7 0    | 2 7 0 2 7 0                      |                          |       |\n| Neufchatel | 2 0 0 0 2 4 0 4 4 0    | 4 0 2 2 5 0                      |                          |       |\n| Palm Sec   | 2 0 0 0 5 2 0 0 2 0    | 9 0 4 0                          |                          |       |\n| Pontac     | 2 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 0    | 2 0 2 8 5 4 0                    |                          |       |\n| Old Rhenish| 2 2 0 0 3 2 0 1 3 2    | 9 1 0 6                          |                          |       |\n| Rhenish    | 3 0 0 0 3 4 0 0 2 0    | 3 4 0 0                          |                          |       |\n| Salamanca  | 3 0 0 0 6 0 0 2 2 0    | 0 6 0 0                          |                          |       |\n| Sherry     | 1 2 0 0 2 4 0 9 4 0    | 1 0 6 0                          |                          |       |\n| Spanish    | 3 0 0 0 6 4 0 1 6 0    | 0 6 0 0                          |                          |       |\n| Wino Tinto | 2 2 0 0 4 3 0 0 5 0    | 0 3 0 0                          |                          |       |\n| Tokay      | 1 4 0 0 1 2 0 0 4 0    | 8 6 0 0                          |                          |       |\n| Tyrol red wine | 1 6 0 0 4 0 0 2 0 | 9 3 2 0                        |                          |       |\n| Red wine   | 2 0 0 0 7 0 0 3 0      | 7 0 0 0                          |                          |       |\n| White      | 2 0 0 0 7 0 0 3 0      | 7 0 0 0                          |                          |       |\n\nThe colour of wine is frequently artificial; a deep red is almost always the effect of artificial additions, as of the red woods, elder berries, bilberries, &c. In France no secret is made of these practices, the colouring matters being publicly thrown out after they have been used.\n\nIt is well known to be a common practice among Adulterators\u2014wine-coopers, innkeepers, and other dealers in wines, to mix adulterate bad wine in order to conceal its defects: if, wine, for instance, the wine be foul, they throw into it a quantity of sugar of lead, which entirely takes away the four taste. For similar purposes alum is often mixed with wine. Such substances, however, are well known to be extremely pernicious to the human constitution; it becomes of importance therefore to be able to detect them whenever they happen to be contained in wine. Several chemists who have turned their attention to this subject, have furnished us with tests for this purpose.\n\nTo discover lead dissolved in wine, boil together in a To detect pint of water an ounce of quicklime and half an ounce lead in of flour of brimstone; and when the liquor, which will wine, be of a yellow colour, is cold, pour it into a bottle, and Wotford's cork it up for use. A few drops of this liquor being Chemical dropped into a glass of wine or cider containing lead, will vol. iii. change the whole into a colour more or less brown, according to the quantity of lead which it contains. If the wine be wholly free from lead, it will be rendered turbid by the liquor, but the colour will be rather a dirty white than a black brown.\n\nBy this test, however, iron is also precipitated when dissolved in wine, and is apt to be taken for lead; a mistake which has ruined several honest merchants. The following test is therefore preferable, as not liable to the same inconvenience.\n\nTake equal parts of calcined oyster-shells and crude Another fulphur in fine powder, and put them in a crucible, methods which put into a fire, and raise the heat suddenly till it has been exposed to a white heat for 15 minutes. Then take it out, let it cool, beat the ingredients to powder, and put them into a well corked bottle. To prepare the test liquor, put 20 grains of this powder together with 120 grains of cream of tartar, and put them into a strong bottle, fill it up with water, boil it for an hour, and let it cool. Cork the bottle immediately, and shake it from time to time. After some hours repose, decant off the clear liquor into an ounce vial, having first put 22 drops of muriatic acid into each vial. Cork these vials accurately with a little wax mixed up with a little turpentine. One part of this liquor, mixed with three parts of suspected wine, will discover the presence of the smallest quantity of lead or copper, by a very sensible black precipitate, and of arsenic by an orange precipitate: but will have no effect on iron, if there be any; the presence of which, however, may be ascertained by adding a little potash, which will turn the liquor black if there be any iron. Pure wine remains limpid after the addition of this liquor.\n\nAs this subject is of importance, we shall add Mr. State of Fourcroy's observations on the state in which lead exists in wine, and on the methods of discovering its presence:\n\n\"Of the different principles which compose wine, there was no doubt (says he) but that acids were the only ones which were capable of dissolving oxide (calx) of lead. But was it the tartarous acid always contained in larger or smaller quantity in wine, or the acetic acid developed in those which have become sharp, and which there is a greater temptation to sweeten?\" Experience\nWine.\n\nWine had proved to me that the acidulous tartrate of potash, or the cream of tartar, takes oxide of lead from the acetous acid, and a precipitate of tartrate of lead is formed; the pure tartaric acid prepared in Scheele's method produces the same effect. In order to understand how the sharp wine which contains these two acids can hold the oxide of lead in solution, I made the experiments which gave me the following results: 1. The acidulous tartrate (cream tart.) has no sensible action upon the oxides of lead. 2. The pure tartaric acid has a slight action upon the oxides, and forms on their surface a little tartrate of lead (tartrated lead), in a white powder. 3. Wine which only contains the tartaric acidule, would not have any action upon the semi-vitrous oxide of lead or litharge. 4. Sharp wine which we attempt to sweeten by this oxide of lead, acts first upon it by the acetous acid it contains. 5. When this acetite of lead is formed, the tartaric acid precipitates it in the form of tartrate of lead: this is proved by the precipitate which the solution of the acetite of lead or sugar of lead forms in the wine. 6. But the acetous acid, if it be in large enough quantity, redissolves the tartrate of lead in the wine just as distilled water would. Bergman has pointed out this solution of tartrate of lead in acetous acid for distinguishing the tartaric salt from the sulphat of lead (vitriol of lead). 7. As this solution of tartrate of lead in the acetous acid is much quicker, and more easy in sharp wines than in distilled water and vinegar, it is probable that the cause of this difference depends upon the citric and malic acids which I have found in wine, and which I shall take notice of again on another occasion. 8. Litharge wine then, or wine sweetened with lead, contains tartrate dissolved in the acetous acid, and perhaps at the same time in the malic and citric acids.\n\n\"It was necessary afterwards to know the properties of this combination. What experience has taught me is as follows: I particularly examined the tartrate of lead and its solution in acetous acid. The tartrate of lead is scarcely at all soluble in water; it is in the form of powder, or of small white grains which have no sensible taste; when it is dissolved in vinegar, the vinegar is softened, its sharpness is diminished remarkably, and the solution takes a flight twelfth taste, much less strong than that of the pure acetite of lead. This taste proves that the union of the tartrate of lead with vinegar is not only a solution like that of salt in water, by which the properties of the salt are not changed, but a combination which gives occasion to new properties. It is a kind of a triple salt, different from those we have hitherto known, formed of two acids and of one base; whereas the other triple salts described hitherto are composed of one acid and two bases. I name this new triple salt aceto-tartrate of lead. The acetous acid adheres to it more than water in a common solution: what is remarkable in this combination is, that the two acids appear to adhere to the base with an equal force, although they have a different attraction for it: nothing is necessary to produce this equilibrium, but to unite first the oxide of lead with the acid to which it adheres the most strongly, and afterwards to put this first compound in contact with the weaker acid.\n\n\"It was necessary, in order to discover easy and certain methods of ascertaining the presence of lead in wine, to examine with care the properties and phenomena of the decompositions of the aceto-tartrate of lead. Fixed alkalis and ammoniac (volatile alkali) precipitate from this salt an oxide of lead, which is of a grayish white colour; but as they occasion a precipitate in pure wine, they cannot be of any use. The fulphuric (vitriolic) acid decomposes the aceto-tartrate of lead, and forms with it instantly sulphate of lead; which being very little soluble, and very heavy, is precipitated. The oxalic, or pure saccharine acid, and the acidulous oxalate, or the salt of tartar of the shops, likewise decompose this salt, and take from it the lead. The oxalate of lead is precipitated in great abundance: these two acids, the fulphuric and oxalic acids, not producing any precipitate in pure wine, are very proper to show the presence of lead in wine. The sulphate and oxalate of lead, when they are precipitated from wine, are coloured, whereas they are very white when they are formed in distilled water; but their red or brown colour does not prevent us from discovering them by a very simple method. If the precipitates be collected with care, and are cautiously heated upon a coal with a blow-pipe, they smoke, become white, exhale vapours, pass successively through the states of the red and yellow oxides of lead, and at length are reduced into metallic globules at the instant they are perceived to be agitated by a very evident effervescence: if we cease to blow at this instant, we obtain globules upon the charcoal. In order to this, it is necessary, however, that the charcoal be solid, and be not cracked, and that we should not have blowed too strongly; otherwise the globules would be absorbed, and would disappear. The sulphate of lead requires a longer time to be reduced than the oxalate of the same metal, and there is a greater hazard of losing the metallic particles, which, beside, are in small quantity.\n\n\"To these two first processes, already sufficiently certain of themselves, I wished to be able to add one which might be capable of pointing out instantly the presence of lead, by an appearance belonging exclusively to this metal, and which might unite to this advantage that of manifesting very small quantities of it. Distilled water impregnated with fulphurated hydrogenous gas, or hepatic gas, extracted from solid alkaline fulphurites (lixivers of sulphur) by acids, presented me with these properties. This solution blackens very deeply that of the aceto-tartrate of lead, and renders \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) of this salt in water or in wine very sensible. The sensibility of this reactive is such, that we may dilute litharge wine with a sufficient quantity of water to take away almost entirely the colour of the wine, and this reactive will still produce a very manifest alteration. The fulphurated water has, besides the advantage not to occasion any change in the wines which do not contain a metallic substance, and it is not precipitated by the acids of wine, like the solutions of alkaline fulphurites. In order to procure this reactive pure, it is necessary to prepare it at the instant of the experiment, by receiving in a vial full of distilled water, and inverted upon a shelf of a small hydro-pneumatic apparatus, filled with distilled water, the fulphurated hydrogenous gas, separated from the solid fulphurite of potash by the fulphuric or muriatic acid, and first filtered through water in another vial; when the second vial contains the third of its volume of the fulphurated hydrogenous gas, the gas is shaken strongly with the water, which fills the two-thirds of the\nWine.\n\nthe vial; and when the absorption is over, the test liquor is prepared. This re-active changes very quickly in the air: it is necessary to make it the moment it is to be employed, and to keep it in a vessel quite full and well corked. If there were any fear that the black colour and the precipitation by the gaseous sulphurated water should not be sufficient to prove the presence of lead in spirituous liquors, I would observe, that this fear would be diminished by employing the three re-actives mentioned in this memoir, and by depending only on the correspondent effects of these three re-actives: but all suspicion would be removed, by reducing the three precipitates by the blow-pipe, and obtaining globules of lead from each of them.\"\n\nSome years ago, the Academy of Lyons proposed the following prize-question: What is the best method of ascertaining the presence and the quantity of alum dissolved in wine, especially in very deep coloured red wine? The prize was gained by M. J. S. Beraud. From his experiments, it appears that a mixture of lime-water and wine in any proportion whatever, will at the end of 12 or 15 hours furnish a quantity of crystals, which may be separated by filtration, and that these crystals will be easiest discovered when the quantities of wine and lime-water are equal; but that wine containing alum dissolved in it, will not form crystals when mixed with lime-water, but merely deposits a muddy sediment. To know therefore whether any wine contains alum or not, we have only to mix a small quantity of it with lime-water: if crystals are formed, it contains no alum; if not, it does. Again, if wine contains alum, the residue that remains after filtration will, as it dries, split into quadrilateral segments, which will detach themselves from the paper which contains them; but if the wine contains no alum, the residue, after it is dry, will remain united and attached to the paper. If one measure of wine and two-thirds of a measure of lime-water deposit crystals, we are certain that if the wine contains alum, the proportion of that alum to the wine will be less than 1 to 1152; if, when equal parts of wine and lime-water are mixed, no crystals are deposited, we may be sure that more than 1/400th part of the mass of wine consists of alum.\n\nA great proportion of the wine consumed in this country is brought from Spain and Portugal; government has always discouraged the importation of French wines by heavy taxes. We are not sure how far such conduct is founded on good policy, as the French wines are confessedly the best, and might be the cheapest; but such is the jealousy and enmity that has always subsisted between Britain and France, that both nations have been contented to injure themselves, provided they could do a greater injury to their neighbours. Besides, the advantages which Britain derives from the Portugal trade are very great, and it would not be easy perhaps to secure them on any other terms.\n\nIt may be worth while to insert here a few directions about the treatment of wines after they have been imported into this country.\u2014On landing, the least they are exposed the better; for they are affected by the seasons, and more or less by climate. March and April are the proper times for shipping wines from France, and they will be landed in England and Ireland in the same degree of temperature. The great art in keeping wines is to prevent their fretting, which is done by keeping them in the same degree of heat. In spring and fall, the wines in Bordeaux are subject to changes that may be dangerous, if not prevented by necessary rackings: these changes are solely the effects of the seasons. If wines are chilled, and of course turn foul, from being shipped and landed in cold weather, they will soon recover by putting them in a warm vault, well covered with sawdust. As soon as they are in the vault, they ought to be covered up. But if shipped and landed in summer, if the smallest degree of fermentation be found on them, it will be requisite to dip the bung cloths in brandy, and leave the bungs loose for some days, to give it time to cool; and if in a fortnight or three weeks the fermentation do not cease, and the wine become bright, it will be proper to rack it (matching the hogsheads well with brimstone), and force it with the whites of eight eggs. If it then becomes fine, bung it tight, and let it remain so until it is bottled. If wines new landed are wanted soon for the bottle, it will be necessary to force them immediately, and let them remain bunged close for at least a month, to recover from the forcing, or if two months the better; for wines bottled in high order come much sooner into drinking than if bottled when flat, which all wines are after forcing. Wine must never be bottled the least foul, which produces a tendency to fret; and if bottled in this state, will never come in order, but may possibly be lost: for this there is no remedy but repeated rackings; and care must be taken (after rinding the hogsheads well and drawing them) to burn a good piece of match in them. This cools the wine, and there is no danger of hurting the colour, for it recovers it in a little time: but if it did, it is absolutely necessary; for if wine is suffered to continue on the fret, it will wear itself to nothing. Wines bottled in good order may be fit to drink in six months; but they are not in perfection before twelve: from that to two years they may continue so; but it would be improper to keep them longer, for wines in general have not the body they had formerly, from the vines being too much forced.\n\nIt sometimes happens that wines feckless and stubborn will not fall with one or even two forcings. It will then be proper to give them five or six gallons of good strong wine, and force them with the whites of a dozen eggs, with a tea-spoonful of sand produced from sawing-marble, or a small spoonful of fine salt. Bottled wine in winter should be well covered with sawdust, and if the vaults are cold and damp, strew it deep on the floor; if sawdust is thrown upon the hogsheads, and their sides are bedded some inches thick, it will keep them from the fret.\n\nThe same treatment is to be regarded with white wines, except that they require to be higher matched, particularly Muscat wines; such as Frontignac, Beziers, &c., which being often sweetened with honey, are very subject to fret; and these only frequent rackings, with a great deal of brimstone, can cool. Hermitage, from not being sufficiently dried, and possessing more richness than claret, is also very liable to come on the fret, and will require much the same treatment as the Muscat wines. Attention should be had to bottle in fine weather, when the wind is north; but to avoid cold or frosty weather. The months of April and October are favourable. The best time to bottle port wine is four years.\nWine years after the vintage, and to keep them two years in bottle before you begin to use them. When wines are racked, and the lees immediately passed through flannel bags into close-necked jars, and directly bottled, there will be very little loss by rackings, as the wine when fine may serve for filling up.\n\nWhen wines are destined for warm climates, it may be proper to rinse the hogheads with brandy; and in bottling many rinse the bottles and corks with it. Wines that have remained a certain time (three or four months) in a vault, and made less or more lee, ought never to be sent into the country without first racking them, otherwise they may be liable to fret; and if bottled in that state, may risk being lost.\n\nWines which may be ordered for immediate drinking will be forced on the shipping, and in a few weeks after they are landed will be fit for the bottle. The forcings proper for claret are the whites of a dozen eggs, beat up with a tea-spoonful of fine salt, and well worked with a forcing rod. Take care to use no bad egg. This is for one hoghead.\n\nThe forcing for white wine is isinglass dissolved in wine. One ounce is sufficient for two hogheads. No salt is to be used in forcing the white wines. See Croft on Wines, 8vo, 1788.\n\nWe shall insert here the following receipt for making raisin wine.\u2014To a 20 gallon vessel take 100 pounds of raisins; pick off the stalks, chop them coarsely, and put them into an open tub more wide than deep. Add two parts in three of the water to them, and let them stand 15 days, stirring them well every day. Then strain and press them, putting aside the liquor that runs from them. Add the remainder of the water to the raisins that have thus been pressed, and let it stand upon them one week, frequently stirring them as before. Then press off the liquor, and add it to what you first collected; putting both runnings together into your vessel, together with one quart of brandy. To colour it, burn three-fourths of a pound of sugar into a small quantity of the liquor, and add this to the wine. When the liquor in the barrel has done rising, stop the vessel close, and let it stand till fit to be bottled. The greater the quantity which the vessel holds, and the longer it is kept in the wood, the better will it be.\n\nAs some of the hints for making wines in Champagne may be useful in the manufacture of the wines of this country, we insert the following abridged account of the different processes that are followed in making white and red champagne.\n\nGreat care is necessary for making white wine. The ripest bunches must be carefully gathered, freed from rotten, dry, and bruised grapes, put into large baskets covered with a cloth to keep them from the sun, carried to the shade, and kept there till the evening, when they are to be speedily pressed. The grapes being laid on the bed of the press, they are covered with three or four layers of flat stones, and the press turned. The juice having run for four or five minutes, the press is turned backward, the stones removed, the grapes which have protruded thrust into the heap, the stones replaced, and the press turned again. The juice from three of such presses, which will not require an hour, is put by itself for the best wine into a vat, where it is left all night to settle.\n\nThe next morning this juice is poured off from the sediment, and put into new well-ringed casks. In these it ferments violently at first, but afterwards imperceptibly, till about the end of December it becomes fine, having gone through all the stages of depuration. It is then racked off in dry weather, on a clear frosty day, and fined with isinglass. About a pound is sufficient for 40 puncheons. The isinglass being dissolved is well beaten, diluted with wine taken from the cask, then poured into it, and the whole well stirred by an instrument introduced at the bung-hole. The wine thus left to settle ferments slightly again, till it be stopped by the cold weather, or by time. In a month or six weeks it is racked off again, and has another fining with half the quantity of isinglass.\n\nFor making red wine, the grapes are gathered with the same precautions as for making white, taking only the black grapes. These are bruised in particular vessels, by men treading on them with strong wooden shoes; part of the stalks are thrown away, and the must is left in covered vessels to ferment sufficiently to extract the colouring matter from the pellicles. In some years, three or four days are sufficient; in others it requires 10, 15, or even 20. When the fermentation begins, the hulls and stalks are forced down so as to be covered with the must, either by means of strong poles furnished with cross pegs, or, which is better, by a couple of strong men going into the vat, and well treading and mixing its contents. When the air above the vat extinguishes a candle, the stalks and hulls rise forcibly, whatever pains be taken frequently to sink them, that the must may not acquire a disagreeable taste; the contents of the vat experience a degree of ebullition, and the colouring matter is decomposed. The fermentation must be made to stop here, that the wine may not acquire a hard taste, which even time cannot destroy.\n\nAbout the end of December, when the fermentation has ceased, the wine is racked off from the lees; about the middle of May it is racked off again; the barrels are fresh hooped, and the wine is put into the cellar. When it is to be sent to the consumer, it is racked a third time; the whites of five or six fresh eggs are well beaten up in a pint of water, for every puncheon holding 240 bottles. Good red champagne will keep in bottles from six to twelve years.\n\n**Wine-Press**, a machine contrived to squeeze the juice out of grapes, and consisting of several pieces of timber, variously disposed, which compose three bodies of timber-work, closely united to the axis, which serves as a swing whereby it may be moved by the vice.

He was a canon regular of St Andrews, and was prior of the monastery of St Serf in the island of Loch Leven in Kinross-shire; for in the chartulary of the priory of St Andrews there are several public instruments of Andrew Winton, as prior of Loch Leven. They are dated between the years 1395 and 1413, so that Winton must have been contemporary with Barbour, whose merits are on several occasions celebrated by him. Winton is best known as the author of the *Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland.* This work was undertaken at the request of Sir John Wemyss, the ancestor of the noble family of that name. It remained neglected for several centuries, but in 1795 a splendid edition of that part of it relative to Scottish affairs, was published by Mr Macpherson. The time of Winton's death is unknown; but, as he mentions the death of Robert duke of Albany, which happened in 1420, the historian must have been alive at that time.\n\n**WIRE,** a piece of metal drawn through the hole of an iron into a thread of a fineness answerable to the hole it passed through.\n\nWires are frequently drawn so fine as to be wrought along with other threads of silk, wool, flax, &c.\n\nThe metals most commonly drawn into wire are gold, silver, copper, and iron. Gold-wire is made of cylindrical ingots of silver, covered over with a skin of gold, and thus drawn successively through a vast number of holes, each smaller and smaller, till at last it is brought to a fineness exceeding that of a hair. That admirable ductility which makes one of the distinguishing characters of gold, is nowhere more conspicuous than in this gilt wire. A cylinder of 48 ounces of silver, covered with a coat of gold, only weighing one ounce, as Dr Halley informs us, is usually drawn into a wire, two yards of which weigh no more than one grain; whence 98 yards of the wire weigh no more than 49 grains, and one single grain of gold covers the 98 yards; so that the ten-thousandth part of a grain is above one-eighth of an inch long.\n\nIn 1784, Mr Rooswag of Strasbourg presented to the board of trade some gauze made of iron wire, for which he received a reward; and the loom he invented for making it was lodged in the collection of machines at Vauxhall. In 1799 Mr Rochon made others, and coated them with a transparent glue, to be substituted instead of horn for ship lanterns, to be used between decks, and in engagements by night. He has since conceived, that with a thin coating of plaster they might be employed to preserve ships from fire, and buildings on shore still more easily; or at least that they might render the ravages of fire less frequent, and less terrible. These gauzes might be very useful too for theatrical decorations, which would not be liable to take fire. Their only inconvenience is their being too little flexible; but Mr Rochon does not despair of means being found by chemistry to remedy this imperfection, and it was with a view of calling attention to this subject, that he read a paper on it to the clas.\n\n**Wire of Lapland.** The inhabitants of Lapland have a sort of thinning slender substance in use among them on several occasions, which is much of the thickness and appearance of our silver wire, and is therefore called, by those who do not examine its structure or substance, Lapland wire. It is made of the fineness of the rein deer, which being carefully separated in the eating, are, by the women, after soaking in water and beating, spun into a sort of thread, of admirable fineness and strength, when wrought to the smallest filaments; but when larger, is very strong, and fit for the purposes of strength and force. Their wire, as it is called, is made of the finest of these threads covered with tin. The women do this business; and the way they take is to melt a piece of tin, and placing at the edge of it a horn, with a hole through it, they draw these finewy threads, covered with the tin, through the hole, which prevents their coming out too thick covered. This drawing is performed with their teeth; and there is a small piece of bone placed at the top of the hole, where the wire is made flat; so that we always find it rounded on all sides but one, where it is flat.\n\nThis wire they use in embroidering their clothes, as we do gold and silver; they often sell it to strangers, under the notion of its having certain magical virtues.\n\n**Wisdom,** usually denotes a higher and more refined notion of things immediately presented to the mind, as it were, by intuition, without the assistance of ratiocination.\n\nSometimes the word is more immediately used, in a moral sense, for what we call prudence, or discretion, which consists in the soundness of the judgement, and a conduct answerable thereto.\n\n**Wisdom of Solomon,** one of the books of the Apocrypha. It abounds with Platonic language, and was probably written after the Cabalistic philosophy was introduced among the Jews.\n\n**Wit,** is a quality of certain thoughts and expressions, much easier perceived than defined. According to Mr Locke, wit lies in the assemblage of ideas, and putting those together with quickness and variety, wherein can be found any resemblance or congruity, thereby to make up pleasant pictures and agreeable visions to the fancy. Mr Addison limited this definition considerably, by observing, that every resemblance of ideas does not constitute wit, but those only which produce delight and surprise. Mr Pope defined wit to be a quick conception and easy delivery; while, according to a late writer, it consists in an assimilation of distant ideas.\n\nThe word *wit* originally signified wisdom. A witte was anciently a wise man: the wittenagemot, or Saxon parliament, an assemblage of wise men. So late as the reign of Elizabeth, a man of pregnant wit, of great\nwit, was a man of vast judgement. We still say, in his wits, out of his wits, for in or out of found mind. The word, however, is now applied in a more limited sense.\n\nWithout attempting to expose the inaccuracy of the definitions above mentioned, or hazarding a definition of our own where so many eminent men have failed, we shall endeavour to show in what true wit consists.\n\nIt is evident that wit excites in the mind an agreeable surprise, and that this is owing entirely to the strange assemblage of related ideas presented to the mind. This end is effected, 1. By debasing things pompous or seemingly grave; 2. By aggrandizing things little or frivolous; 3. By setting ordinary objects in a particular and uncommon point of view, by means not only remote but apparently contrary. Of so much consequence are surprise and novelty, that nothing is more tafteless, and sometimes disgusting, than a joke that has become stale by frequent repetition. For the same reason, even a pun or happy allusion will appear excellent when thrown out extempore in conversation, which would be deemed execrable in print. In like manner, a witty repartee is infinitely more pleasing than a witty attack: for though, in both cases, the thing may be equally new to the reader or hearer, the effect on him is greatly injured, when there is access to suppose that it may be the slow production of study and premeditation. This, however, holds most with regard to the inferior tribes of witticisms, of which their readiness is the best recommendation.\n\nWe shall illustrate these observations by subjoining a specimen or two of each of these sorts of wit:\n\nOf the first sort, which consists in the debasement of things great and eminent, Butler, amongst a thousand other instances, hath given us those which follow:\n\nAnd now had Phoebus in the lap\nOf Thetis taken out his nap:\nAnd, like a lobster boil'd, the morn\nFrom black to red began to turn.\n\n_Hudibras_, part ii. canto 2.\n\nHere the low allegorical style of the first couplet, and the simile used in the second, afford us a just notion of this lowest species, which is distinguished by the name of the _ludicrous_. Another specimen from the same author you have in these lines:\n\nGreat on the bench, great in the saddle,\nThat could as well bind o'er as swaddle,\nMighty he was at both of these,\nAnd fitly'd of war, as well as peace:\nSo some rats of amphibious nature,\nAre either for the land or water.\n\n_Ibid._ part i. canto 1.\n\nIn this coarse kind of drollery, those laughable translations or paraphrases of heroic and other serious poems, wherein the authors are said to be travestied, chiefly abound.\n\nThe second kind, consisting in the aggrandisement of little things, which is by far the most splendid, and displays a soaring imagination, these lines of Pope will serve to illustrate:\n\nAs Berecynthia, while her offspring vie\nIn homage to the mother of the sky,\n\nSurveys around her in the blest abode,\nAn hundred sons, and every son a god:\nNot with less glory mighty Dulness crown'd,\nShall take thro' Grubstreet her triumphant round;\nAnd her Parnassus glancing o'er at once,\nBehold a hundred sons, and each a dunce.\n\nThis whole multitude is spirited. The parent of the celestial is contrasted by the daughter of night and chaos; heaven by Grubstreet; gods by dunces. Besides, the parody it contains on a beautiful passage in Virgil adds a particular lustre to it. This species we may term the _thronical_, or the _mock-majestic_. It affects the most pompous language, and florid phraseology, as much as the other affects the reverse, the vilest and most grovelling dialect.\n\nTo this class also we must refer the application of grave reflections to mere trifles. For that great and serious are naturally associated by the mind, and likewise little and trifling, is sufficiently evinced by the common modes of expression on these subjects used in every tongue. An apposite instance of such an application we have from Philips:\n\nMy galligaskins, that have long withstood\nThe winter's fury and encroaching frosts,\nBy time subdued, (What will not time subdue!)\nAn horrid chasm disclose.\n\n_Splendid Shilling._\n\nOf the third species of wit, which is by far the most multifarious, and which results from what may be called the quirkiness or singularity of the imagery, we shall give a few specimens that will serve to mark some of its principal varieties. To illustrate all would be impossible. The first shall be where there is an apparent contrariety in the things she exhibits as connected. This kind of contrast we have in these lines of Garth:\n\nThen Hydrops next appears amongst the throng;\nBloated and big he slowly fails along:\nBut like a miser in excess he's poor,\nAnd pines for thirst amidst her watery store.\n\n_Dispensary._\n\nA second sort is, where the things compared are what with dialecticians would come under the denomination of _disparates_, being such as can be ranked under no common genus. Of this we shall subjoin an example from Young:\n\nHealth chiefly keeps an Atheist in the dark;\nA fever argues better than a Clarke:\nLet but the logic in his pulse decay,\nThe Grecian he'll renounce, and learn to pray.\n\n_Universal Passion._\n\nA third variety in this species springs from confounding artfully the proper and the metaphorical sense of an expression. In this way, one will assign as a motive what is discovered to be perfectly absurd, when but ever so little attended to; and yet from the ordinary meaning of the words, hath a specious appearance on a single glance. Of this kind we have an instance in the subsequent lines:\n\nWhile thus the lady talk'd, the knight\nTurn'd th' outside of his eyes to white,\nAs men of inward light are wont\nTo turn their optics in upon't.\n\nHudibras, part iii. canto i.\n\nFor whither can they turn their eyes more properly than\nto the light?\n\nA fourth variety, much resembling the former, is\nwhen the argument or comparison (for all argument is\na kind of comparison) is founded on the supposal of cor-\nporeal or personal attributes in what is strictly not sus-\nceptible of them; as in this,\n\nBut Hudibras gave him a twitch\nAs quick as lightning in the breech,\nJust in the place where honour's lodg'd,\nAs wise philosophers have judg'd:\nBecause a kick in that place more\nHurts honour than deep wounds before.\n\nIbid. part ii. canto 3.\n\nThe fifth, and only other variety which we shall\nmention, is that which arises from a relation, not in the\nthings signified, but in the signs of all relations, no\ndoubt the slightest. Identity here gives rise to puns\nand clinches; resemblance to quibbles, cranks, and\nrhimes: Of these it is quite unnecessary to exhibit speci-\nmens.\n\nWit, John de, a celebrated pensioner of Holland,\nand one of the greatest politicians of his time, was the\nson of Jacob de Wit, burgomaster of Dort, and was\nborn in 1625. He became well skilled in civil law, po-\nlitics, mathematics, and other sciences; and wrote a\ntreatise on the Elements of Curved lines, published by\nFrancis Schooten. Having taken his degree of doctor\nof law, he travelled into foreign courts, where he be-\ncame esteemed for his genius and prudence. At his re-\nturn to his native country in 1650, he became pension-\nary of Dort, then counsellor-pensionary of Holland and\nWest Friesland, intendant and registrar of the fiefs, and\nkeeper of the great seal. He was thus at the head\nof affairs in Holland; but his opposition to the re-\nestablishment of the office of stadtholder, which he\nthought a violation of the freedom and independence of\nthe republic, cost him his life, when the prince of\nOrange's party prevailed. He and his brother Corne-\nlius were assassinated by the populace at The Hague in\n1674, aged 47.","sp":417,"ep":419},{"h":"WITCH","t":"a person guilty of witchcraft.","sp":419,"ep":419},{"h":"WITCHCRAFT","t":"a supernatural power which per-\nsons were formerly supposed to obtain the possession of\nby entering into a compact with the devil. They gave\nthemselves up to him body and soul; and he engaged,\nthat they should want for nothing, and that he would\navenge them upon all their enemies. As soon as the\nbargain was concluded, the devil delivered to the witch\nan imp, or familiar spirit, to be ready at a call, and do\nwhatever it was directed. By the assistance of this imp\nand the devil together, the witch, who was almost al-\nways an old woman, was enabled to transport herself in\nthe air on a broomstick or a spit to distant places to at-\ntend the meetings of the witches. At these meetings\nthe devil always presided. They were enabled also to\ntransform themselves into various shapes, particularly to\nassume the forms of cats and hares, in which they most\ndelighted; to inflict diseases on whomsoever they\nthought proper; and to punish their enemies in a variety\nof ways.\n\nThe belief that certain persons were endowed with\nsupernatural power, and that they were afflicted by in-\nvisible spirits, is very ancient. The sagae of the Ro-\nmans seem rather to have been sorcerers than witches;\nindeed the idea of a witch, as above described, could\nnot have been prevalent till after the propagation of\nChristianity, as the heathens had no knowledge of the\nChristian devil.\n\nWitchcraft was universally believed in Europe till the\n16th century, and even maintained its ground with to-\nlerable firmness till the middle of the 17th. Vast num-\nbers of reputed witches were convicted and condemned\nto be burnt every year. The methods of discovering\nthem were various. One was, to weigh the supposed Provincial\ncriminal against the church bible, which, if she was\nguilty, would preponderate; another, by making her\nattempt to say the Lord's Prayer; this no witch was\nable to repeat entirely, but would omit some part or\nsentence thereof. It is remarkable, that all witches did\nnot hesitate at the same place; some leaving out one\npart, and some another. Teats, through which the\nimps sucked, were indubitable marks of a witch: these\nwere always raw, and also inflexible; and, if squeezed,\nsometimes yielded a drop of blood. A witch could not\nweep more than three tears, and that only out of the\nleft eye. This want of tears was, by the witch-finders,\nand even by some judges, considered as a very substan-\ntial proof of guilt. Swimming a witch was another\nkind of popular ordeal generally practised: for this she\nwas stripped naked, and cross-bound, the right thumb\nto the left toe, and the left thumb to the right toe.\nThus prepared, she was thrown into a pond or river, in\nwhich, if guilty, she could not sink; for having, by her\ncompact with the devil, renounced the benefit of the\nwater of baptism, that element, in its turn, renounced\nher, and refused to receive her into its bosom. Sir Ro-\nbert Filmer mentions two others by fire: the first, by\nburning the thatch of the house of the suspected witch;\nthe other, burning any animal supposed to be bewitched\nby her, as a hog or ox. These, it was held, would\nforce a witch to confess.\n\nThe trial by the stool was another method used for\nthe discovery of witches. It was thus managed: Hav-\ning taken the suspected witch, she was placed in the\nmiddle of a room upon a stool or table, cross-legged, or\nin some other uneasy posture; to which if she submitted\nnot, she was then bound with cords: there she was\nwatched, and kept without meat or sleep for the space\nof 24 hours (for, they said, within that time they should\nsee her imp come and suck). A little hole was like-\nwise made in the door for imps to come in at; and lest\nit should come in some less discernible shape, they that\nwatched were taught to be ever and anon sweeping the\nroom, and, if they saw any spiders or flies, to kill them:\nif they could not kill them, then they might be sure\nthey were imps. If witches, under examination or tor-\nture, would not confess, all their apparel was changed,\nand every hair of their body shaven off with a sharp\nrazor, lest they should secrete magical charms to pre-\nvent their confessing. Witches were most apt to con-\nfess on Fridays.\n\nBy such trials as these, and by the accusation of chil-\ndren,\nWitchcraft, dren, old women, and fools, were thousands of unhappy women condemned for witchcraft, and burnt at the stake. In the 18th volume of the Statistical Account of Scotland there is the trial of two witches, William Coke and Alfon Dick, in Kirkaldy, in 1636. The evidence on which they were condemned is absolutely ridiculous: they were, however, burnt for witchcraft. The expenses which the town and kirk-session were put to on this occasion were as follows:\n\nIn primis.\u2014To Mr James Miller, when he went to Preflowne for a man to try them, 47s.\n\nItem.\u2014To the man of Culross, (the executioner), when he went away the first time, 12s.\n\nItem.\u2014For coals for the witches, 24s.\n\nItem.\u2014In purchasing the commission,\n\nItem.\u2014For one to go to Finnmouth for the laird to sit upon their affize as judge,\n\nItem.\u2014For harden to be jumps to them,\n\nItem.\u2014For making of them,\n\nSumma for the kirk's part L. 17 10 Scots.\n\nThe Town's part of expenses defurred extraordinarily upon William Coke and Alfon Dick.\n\nIn primis.\u2014For 10 loads of coals to burn them, 5 merks,\n\nItem.\u2014For a tar barrel, 14s.\n\nItem.\u2014For towes,\n\nItem.\u2014To him that brought the executioner,\n\nItem.\u2014To the executioner for his pains,\n\nItem.\u2014For his expenses here,\n\nItem.\u2014For one to go to Finnmouth for the laird\n\nSumma town part, L. 17 10 Scots.\n\nBoth, L. 34 11\n\nOr L. 2 17 7 Ster.\n\nFor a considerable time after the inquisition was erected, the trials of witches (as heretics) were confined to that tribunal; but the goods of those who were condemned being confiscated to the holy office, its ministers were so active in discovering sorcerers, that the different governments found it necessary to deprive them of the cognizance of this crime. On the continent, commissioners were then appointed for the discovery and conviction of witches, who, though less active than the inquisitors, were but too zealous in prosecuting their function. In 1494, Sprenger and Inquisitor, two persons employed in this commission, published a collection of trials, most of which had come before themselves, under the title of Malleus Maleficarum: this served as a kind of institute for their successors.\n\nThe first writers against witchcraft were stigmatized as Atheists, though they only endeavoured to prove the imbecility of the persons accused, and the insatiability or the knavery of their accusers. Such were the epithets bestowed by Dr Henry More, and even by Cudworth himself. Wierus, the disciple of the celebrated Agrip-\n\npa, gave rise to the first great controversy on this subject. His master had taught him humanity; and he endeavoured, but with too feeble a hand, to stop the bloody proceedings of the judges. Wierus appears to have been a well-disposed, weak man, with extensive reading on his subject, but too narrow-minded to comprehend it thoroughly. He involved himself in unspeakable difficulties, by admitting the action of supernatural powers in certain diseases, and in possessions, while he denied that witches had any concurrence in them. These appearances (said he) are illusions of the devil, who persuades simple and melancholy persons that the mischief he himself performs, is done by them, and at their pleasure. He was weak enough to attempt the explanation of every story alleged by his antagonists, without questioning the truth of the facts.\n\nBodinus, a French lawyer of eminence, who had assisted at several trials of witches, wrote against Wierus, in his Demonomania. He urged the concurrent testimonies of sufficient witnesses, and the confessions of the witches themselves, to establish the existence of sorcery. Wierus owned that the unhappy persons believed themselves to be guilty of the crimes alleged against them, but that they were deceived by the devil. But what do you make of the witches meetings, cried Bodinus? The witches (replied his antagonist) are insensible. This explanation was so unsatisfactory that Wierus passed for a magician, whom the devil had furnished with specious arguments to save others from punishment. Lerchemer, Godelmann, Ewichius, Ewaldus, and some others, followed him, notwithstanding this stigma; but they were opposed by men of more acuteness and consistency than themselves; by Remigius, who had condemned several hundreds of sorcerers to the flames; Delrio, whose book is a complete Corpus Magiae; Cujas, Erasmus, Scribonius, Camerarius, and a crowd of others.\n\nIn this country, while the belief in witchcraft was supported by royal authority (for James I. is universally known to have written on demonology) countenanced by Bacon, and generally adopted among the people, only one writer was hardy enough to oppose it. This was Reginald Scott, who published a collection of impostures detected, under the title of Discoveries of Witchcraft. James ordered the book to be burnt by the common executioner, and the judges continued to burn witches as usual. During the civil wars, upwards of eighty were hanged in Suffolk, on the accusations of Hopkins the witch-finder. Webster was the next writer against witchcraft; but he had a different fate from that of Scott, for most of his arguments were refuted by Glanville. This very acute writer was induced to publish his Philosophical Considerations about Witchcraft, by the apprehension, that the increasing disbelief of witches and apparitions tended to affect the evidences of religion, and even of a Deity. In respect of argument, he was certainly superior to his adversaries; his reasoning is perspicuous, though sometimes fickle, rested on the most precarious foundations of evidence, and arranged with great skill.\n\nOn the continent, this controversy seemed almost forgotten, till Bekker published his Monde Enchant\u00e9e, in which he denied the existence of witches on the Cartesian principle, that the Deity is the source of all action, consequently actions opposite to his nature and attributes cannot be supposed to exist. He was answered by Frederick\nWitchcraft Frederick Hoffman, the father of the modern theory and practice of medicine, in his dissertation De Diaboli Potentia in Corpora.\n\nThe latest witchcraft frenzy was in New England, about 1692, when the execution of witches became a calamity more dreadful than the sword or the pestilence. The accusers became so daring, that neither civil nor religious authority would have proved a security against their attacks, if all the prosecutions had not been suddenly dropped, and the prisoners set at liberty. So far did those wretches proceed in absurdity, that a dog was accused of throwing persons into fits by looking at them. As soon as the prosecutions were stopped, all reports of witchcraft ceased.\n\nIt would be ridiculous to attempt a serious refutation of the existence of witches; and at present, luckily, the talk is unnecessary. In this country, at least, the discouragement long given to all suspicion of witchcraft, and the repeal of the statutes against that crime, have very much weakened, though perhaps they have not entirely eradicated, the persuasion. On the continent, too, it is evidently in decline; and notwithstanding the exertions of Dr. De Haen, and of the celebrated La-vater, we have little doubt but that in a short time posterity will wonder at the credulity of their ancestors. That there ever were witches, is an opinion that cannot for a moment be believed by a thinking man. The actions imputed to them were either absurd or impossible; the witnesses by whose evidence they were condemned, either weak enthusiasts or downright villains; and the confessions ascribed to the witches themselves, effects of a disordered imagination produced by cruel treatment and excessive watchings. As to the nightly meetings, demonologists themselves have been obliged to confess, that they were nothing else but uneasy dreams, often produced by soporific compositions. The facts which have been brought forward by the advocates for witchcraft bear in their front the most evident marks of trick and imposture; and this has constantly been found out whenever these facts have been properly examined.

Save only that when a widow brings a writ of dower, and the tenant pleads that the husband is not dead; this being looked upon as a dilatory plea, is in favour of the widow, and for greater expedition allowed to be tried by witnesses examined before the judges: and so, faith Finch, shall no other case in our law. But Sir Edward Coke mentions some others; as, to try whether the tenant in a real action Wittenberg was duly summoned, or the validity of a challenge to a juror: so that Finch's observation must be confined to the trial of direct and not collateral issues.

See Isatis, Botany Index; see also Dyeing.\n\nThe preparation of woad for dyeing, as practised in France, is minutely described by Astruc, in his Memoirs for a Natural History of Languedoc. The plant puts forth at first five or six upright leaves, about a foot long and six inches broad: when these hang downwards, and turn yellow, they are fit for gathering: five crops are gathered in one year. The leaves are carried directly to a mill, much resembling the oil or tan mills, and ground into a smooth paste. If this process was deferred for some time, they would putrefy, and send forth an insupportable stench. The paste is laid in heaps, pressed close and smooth, and the blackish crust, which forms on the outside, reunited if it happens to crack: if this was neglected, little worms would be produced in the cracks, and the woad would lose a part of its strength. After lying for fifteen days, the heaps are opened, the crust rubbed and mixed with the inside, and the matter formed into oval balls, which are pressed close and solid in wooden moulds. These are dried up on hurdles: in the sun, they turn black on the outside; in a clofe place, yellowish, especially if the weather be rainy. The dealers in this commodity prefer the first, though it is said the workmen find no considerable difference between the two. The good balls are distinguished by their being weighty, of an agreeable smell, and when rubbed, of a violet colour within. For the use of the dyer, these balls require a farther preparation: they are beat with wooden mallets, on a brick or stone floor, into a grofs powder; which is heaped up in the middle of the room to the height of four feet, a space being left for passing round the sides.

His father, Mr James Wodrow, was a man of\nlearning and piety. He preached occasionally to the per-\nsecuted Presbyterians, and taught a little academy of their\nstudents of philosophy and theology at Glasgow, before\nthe Revolution. About that time he was ordained one\nof the ministers of that city, continuing his connexion\nwith the academy till he was elected professor of theo-\nlogy by the university in the year 1692. He taught\nwith reputation and success till his death in 1708.\n\nHis son Robert was born in the year 1679; his mo-\nther being then in the 51st year of her age. Her death\n(though it did not happen till several years after), was\nthen fully expected; and his father, obnoxious to a ty-\nrannical government, narrowly escaped imprisonment, or\nsomething worse, by attempting to obtain a last short in-\nterview with her. As he passed the town guard-house, he\nwas marked, and soon followed by the soldiers into his own\nhouse, and even into his wife's bed-chamber, where he was\nconcealed. Their officer checked this violence; sent them\nout of the room, and left the house himself; placing, how-\never, sentinels both within and without, till the birth\nshould be over. In half an hour after, Mr Wodrow at\nhis wife's suggestion, assumed the bonnet and great-coat\nof the servant of the physician then in attendance; and\ncarrying the lantern before him, made an easy escape\nthrough the midst of the guards. They soon renewed\ntheir search with marks of irritation, thrusting their\nwords into the very bed where the lady lay; who\npleasantly desired them to desist, \"for the bird (said she)\nis now flown.\"\n\nHis son Robert went through the usual course of liter-\nary education at Glasgow, entered the university in\n1691; and prosecuted the study of the languages and\nthe different branches of philosophy, till he became a\nstudent of theology under the tuition of his father. He\nwas chosen librarian to the university in the year 1698,\nand continued in that office four years. There he be-\ngan his researches into everything connected with the\necclesiastical history of his country, which he continued\nto pursue to the end of his life; and also imbibed his\ntaste for medals, inscriptions, and whatever seemed curi-\nous or illustrative of Roman, Celtic, and British anti-\nquities.\n\nHe was among the first in Scotland who attended to\nthe study of natural history. From a great number of\nletters in his own handwriting, begun about this time,\nit appears that he was in habits of the utmost intimacy\nwith a select number of literary gentlemen, animated\nwith the same ardour of research; that they corresponded\nregularly with one another, made collections of finger-\nstones, of fossils, petrified plants, fishes, &c., and ex-\nchanged what they could spare from their respective\nstores. Among his correspondents were Mr William\nNicolson, archdeacon, afterwards bishop of Carlisle, and\nat last of Derry, author of the Historical Libraries;\nMr Edward Lhwyd keeper of the Ashmolean cloister at\nOxford; Sir Robert Sibbald, physician in Edinburgh,\nauthor of a natural history of Scotland, and another of\nFife; Lord Pitmedden; Messrs James Sutherland,\nLaughlan Campbell minister of Campbellton, and others.\nIn a letter to Mr Lhwyd dated August 1709, Mr\nWodrow tells him his name was but at a little distance\nfrom a place where they had been litho-copying together,\nduring a visit of Mr Lhwyd to Scotland. \"My paro-\nchial charge (he continues) does not allow me the same\ntime I had then for those subterranean studies; but my\ninclination is equally strong, perhaps stronger. I take\nit to be one of the best diversions from serious study, and\nin itself a great duty, to admire my Maker's works. I\nhave got some store of fossils here from our marle,\nlimestone, &c., and heartily with I had the knowing\nMr Lhwyd here to pick out what he wants, and help\nme to class a great many species which I know not what\nto make of.\" He informs him, in the end of the letter,\nthat he had 500 or 600 species of one thing or another\nrelative to natural history.\n\nMr Wodrow, when he left Glasgow, resided a short\ntime in the neighbourhood, in the house of a very distant\nrelation, Sir \u2014\u2014\u2014 Maxwell of Nether Pollock, then\none of the Scots judges. It being within the bounds of\nthe presbytery of Paisley, he offered himself to them\nfor probationary trials, and obtained their licence to\npreach the gospel in March 1703. In the summer fol-\nlowing, the parish of Eastwood, where Lord Pollock\nlived, becoming vacant, by the death of Mr Matthew\nCrawford (another Scots historian), a petition, with an\nunanimous call or invitation from the parish to Mr\nWodrow to be their minister, was presented to the\npresbytery;\npresbytery; and they, wavering part of the usual second trials, in order to expedite the business, ordained Mr Wodrow to be minister of Eastwood on the 28th of October 1734. In this charge he continued to the end of his life. Notwithstanding his ministerial duty, he still found some time to gratify the early bent of his mind towards natural history, and his curiosity to learn everything in his power, not only at home, but concerning the natural productions of other countries, and the opinions, customs, manners, and way of living of their inhabitants. In his farewell letters to his friends, about to fail to the Scottish settlement of Darien or to the coast of Africa, &c., he directed their attention and enquiries to these subjects; and something similar he frequently wrote to other friends going to reside in remote places of the Highlands, or even on the continent of Europe. The collection of his MS. letters bound up in five or six thick 8vo volumes, though reaching nearly to the end of his life, seems to consist only of the first draught of his own letters to his friends, not a single scrap is now to be found of their answers to him.\n\nAfter his ordination, however, this worthy man, considering the duties of his office as his principal and only proper business, rose into distinguished reputation and usefulness as a preacher, and was looked upon as one of the first clergymen in the west of Scotland. Humble and unambitious of public notice, he was well entitled to it, by his conscientious and exemplary piety, his learning, not only in professional, but in other branches of knowledge, his natural good sense and solid judgement, his benevolent obliging spirit to all, his warm attachment to his friends, who formed a wide circle around him, and especially his deep concern for the best interests of his people, and active exertions for their instruction and improvement. His weekly sermons were all distinctly written out in long hand, and even his lectures in shorthand. Accustomed to regular composition, he had acquired an uncommon facility in it. His countenance and appearance in the pulpit was manly and dignified; his voice clear and commanding; his manner serious and animated; these things, joined with the general prejudice in his favour, added to the impression of the plain edifying discourses he delivered, without papers, to his hearers; and living in the near neighbourhood of Glasgow his little church was often crowded, especially when he dispensed the Lord's Supper, conferred in Scotland as the principal religious solemnity.\n\nYet these talents, and this merited popularity which followed them, made little impression on his own modest conscientious mind; for he chose to continue in the obscure country parish with which he was first connected, resisting all the attempts made by his friends or by strangers to get him translated into several other more honourable and opulent parishes, who were desirous of the benefit of his ministry, however convenient the change might have proved for the education of his family. In the year 1712, the magistrates of Glasgow invited him to be one of the ministers of that city; and in January 1717, a deputation from the town of Stirling did the same. On the other hand, the patron, heirs, and elders of his own parish, strenuously opposed the translation. The presbytery, who had it in their power to have appointed it, found great difficulties in both cases on the plea of the major bonum ecclesiae; referred the decision in the first case to the synod, and in the last to the commission of the General Assembly, and Wodrow, the courts thought proper to put no restraint on the minister's judgement or inclination, as he himself was certainly the best judge of his comparative usefulness in two different situations.\n\nMr Wodrow was equally conscientious and assiduous in the business of the ecclesiastical courts, as in his parochial duty. Notwithstanding his studious turn, he punctually attended the meetings of Presbytery, Synod, and General Assembly, when elected, as he often was, a member of that court; and also the commissions in November and March, which regularly met during that period of the church. His connexion with Lord Pollock made his journeys to Edinburgh easy; and after he began to collect materials for his voluminous history, his personal inspection of the public records and of the various MSS. accumulated in the Edinburgh libraries, made his visits to that capital frequent and necessary.\n\nIn common with the great body of the Presbyterians, he had strongly imbibed what are called Whig principles; in other words, he was warmly attached to the constitutional liberties of the people, as established by the revolution settlement. No wonder! The dreadful persecution and oppression they had suffered during the two preceding reigns were still fresh and galling to their minds: they considered the elevation of King William to the throne and the Hanover succession, as the two chief bulwarks raised up by Providence, for the security both of their religion and liberty. They trembled at every dark appearance threatening to this security, such as the death of King William. That cloud, however, was soon dissipated by the perseverance of the queen's ministers in his views and measures, and the splendid victories of Marlborough and his allies over the armies of Louis XIV. But the elevation of the Tory ministry in the latter part of the queen's reign was a severe trial to the Scottish Presbyterians, and involved the conscientious part of their clergy in very serious difficulties and dangers. The oath of abjuration required at that time from clergymen, and enforced by civil penalties, and even the royal proclamation for a national thanksgiving, after the peace of Utrecht, pressed hard upon the scrupulous consciences of many of the clergy. The very language of the oath seemed to them dubious and jejune, hostile to the elector of Hanover's newly acquired right to the crown, conferred on him by the parliament and the people; and as to the other point, they had not freedom to lead their people, in a solemn thanksgiving to Heaven for a peace, termed safe and honourable, which they and the generality of their hearers considered as dangerous and disgraceful. Mr Wodrow, as might be expected, was one of the recusants of the oath; for nothing could move him to flatter with his conscience. At the same time the liberality and equity of his mind led him to judge candidly of the consciences of others. Accordingly, he made every effort in his power to reconcile his clerical brethren, and his own people, to such of the clergy as had the freedom to take it, and by so doing, had rendered themselves obnoxious to popular prejudice and odium. With such, this good man still continued to live, not only in Christian, but ministerial communion; endeavouring to soften and remove the prejudices against them, and, in as far as his influence reached, to revive and cherish a spirit of mutual forbearance. Many proposals he made, and private meetings...\nmeetings and conferences he held with his brethren, to prevent their differences from rising, as they threatened to do, into a schism; to prevent them especially from entering at all into the church courts; justly afraid of the sparks of animosity too apt to be kindled there. His endeavours and those of his friends were seconded by the prudence of the superior courts, especially the commission of the General Assembly. Whatever passed there in the way of admonition to the rest of the church, breathed the spirit of mutual forbearance and love. How he managed the other difficult and delicate point, the Thanksgiving, in a consistency with his duty, does not appear in his letters; nor is it now worth while to investigate this as a trait of his character, which might be done, perhaps, from his MS. sermons preached at the time. Only it is pleasing to remark from the letters, that the same spirit of wisdom and mild forbearance which animated the majority of the clergy in the west, seems also to have pervaded the officers of the crown, justices of the peace, and other civil magistrates in Scotland at the time. The oath was not pressed on the recusants, and the execution of the legal penalties incurred by the neglect of it avoided; for their general loyalty was undoubted.\n\nA more severe stroke was inflicted on their adversaries by the Tory ministry in the year 1710 by an act of the British parliament which restored patronage to its former full force. An act of the Scotch parliament passed after the Revolution had extracted the chief sting of that grievance, by placing the election of the minister of every parish in the hands of the landed proprietors, called heritors, in conjunction with the elders, or members of the kirk-session. A majority of that joint body, at a meeting appointed for the purpose, drew up a call or written invitation, which they subscribed to a particular candidate to be their minister. This was presented to the presbytery of the bounds, the proper judges of his learning and moral character; and if these were found unexceptionable, he was ordained, or solemnly consecrated and installed into the office. This Scotch act having continued in force for twenty years, and being conceived to have become perpetual by the articles of the Union, was now repealed; and the choice of a minister to every parish was in effect placed in the power of a single person, a patron, because he had in fact the sole power of nominating the only candidate who could enjoy the benefice.\n\nMr Wodrow was exceedingly averse from the revival of the power of patronage; and in this he was influenced both by his political and religious principles. In his letters, he seems to have looked upon a patron of a parish, as a kind of hereditary despot; or at least like a prince, who had no restraints laid on his prerogative, to prevent or check the abuse of it. The paramount power or trust committed to a patron, this conscientious minister could not reconcile with the apostolic counsels, to commit the keeping of religious truth to faithful men, able also to instruct others. He thought it very improper to leave the choice of a religious instructor, in the first instance, to any single person whatever, especially to one generally a stranger to the circumstances of the parishioners; one who had little knowledge, and therefore little sympathy with them in their religious sentiments and feelings. He was persuaded that the purposes of edification, and the peace of the country, circumstanced as Scotland then was, were Wodrow much better secured by the restraints laid on a patron in the act 1690, that is, by admitting the two principal bodies of the parish to a participation with him in his choice, than by trusting it wholly to himself; and he threw out many judicious hints in his letters, and even schemes or proposals to his brethren, on this difficult and important subject.\n\nOn the other hand, he wished nothing to be attempted but in a constitutional way, in harmony with the civil power. Few men were so sensible as he was of the abuses incident to popular government, either in church or state, and of the danger of resisting, even unjust and oppressive laws, in a tumultuous or disorderly manner. The Presbyterian church, in the outward order or form of it, he viewed as a well regulated republic. He did not consider the people in their individual capacity, as qualified to vote even on the choice of their own minister. The elders of the parish he looked upon as the representatives of the people in the ecclesiastical courts; and their number, in his own congregation, he restricted to a very few, four or five at most, fit to assist him in the exercise of church discipline within the parish. The rest of his fellows were deacons, whose jurisdiction was confined to the care of the poor, visiting the sick, and distributing the bread and wine at the communion, but could not, like the former, be chosen to represent the parish in the presbytery and superior courts. In this sense of the necessity of order and subordination, he persevered to the end of his life. When, contrary to his judgement or vote, an unpopular brother was to be ordained in a parish within twelve or fifteen miles distant from Eastwood, in consequence of a sentence of the General Assembly, to be executed, perhaps with military assistance; this aged minister thought it his duty, regardless of personal danger or odium, to countenance the young brother, by joining with the rest of the clergy in laying their hands on him, inviting him afterwards to his pulpit, and exerting any influence he had to conciliate the irritated minds of that parish.\n\nThe only publication for which the world is indebted to Mr Wodrow, is The History of the Singular Sufferings of the Church of Scotland during the twenty-eight years immediately preceding the Revolution. It was written at a proper distance of time from the events it records; and printed at Edinburgh in the year 1721, in two large folio volumes, with two appendixes consisting of copies of the public records, and of many private, family, and personal papers, letters, &c., inserted as vouchers of the historical facts. In collecting this great body of information, the author was assisted by his friends, who cheerfully seconded his own almost incredible industry and patience of research. In consequence of this, the book has more the appearance of a biographical, than of a historical work. It has, however, the form, and all the essentials of a regular history, divided into books, chapters, and sections, with proper margins and indexes; written in a plain, rather too familiar style, unavoidably interfered with Scotticism, yet these sufficiently intelligible to an English reader. It exhibits a distinct sketch of the characters both of the principal sufferers, and of their persecutors; of the springs of the persecution, in the unjustifiable plans and measures of an arbitrary government; with the motives of the advisers and executors of them. The unfortunate and innocent\nWodrow. innocent sufferers, our author viewed in the light, not of a set of wild fanatics, as they were called by their contemporaries, and frequently too by later historians; many of them were most respectable for their rank in their country, as well as for their talents and virtues; but even those in the lower ranks of society, as confessors and martyrs in the noble cause which they had espoused, the support of the rights of conscience, and of national liberty.\n\nThe subject of the history is the most melancholy that could be chosen; a long and severe persecution of a people, who had been guilty of nothing undutiful to their civil or ecclesiastical rulers; a series of open acts of injustice and tyranny, perpetrated under the colour of law, and this with such an increasing and merciless violence, as to sink the usual spirit of a free people, and easily quell one or two feeble ill-timed attempts to resist their oppressors. No wonder that the continued view of such a wretched and melancholy scene, without anything joyful to interrupt it, should give a melancholy tinge to the mind of the writer, easily communicated to his readers. On the other hand some things have happily an opposite tendency. The mass of biographical intelligence, though it must be confessed it is much too voluminous, and too minute for the management of any historian whatsoever, yet furnishes a variety of anecdotes, which give some needful relaxation or relief to the sympathy of the reader. These indeed are in part the simple annals of the poor, without the varnish or easy elegance of polished life; but even in this shape they are not destitute, both of entertainment and instruction; and then the minuteness in the detail of names, of persons, places, and other particular circumstances, adds to the impressiveness of the facts, by placing their certainty beyond all reasonable doubt.\n\nIf faithfully to record past facts, and transmit the knowledge of them to posterity, be the principal duty of a historian, this Wodrow has certainly aimed at; and also to repel any feelings hostile to his fidelity and impartiality; in short, to come as near as he was able to the motto prefixed to his volumes, Nec studio, nec odio. Doubtless, like all other men, he had some political, and many theological prejudices, the last chiefly imbued from education, and confirmed by too high a veneration for the characters of our first reformers\u2014prejudices which warped his personal opinions and feelings on both subjects. But he seems to have made a considerable effort to prevent his party prejudices from warping or perverting his judgement of the truth or falsehood of stubborn historical facts. Nothing almost oratorical enters into his narratives, though there is room for admiration, and much scope for just indignation; no exaggerated encomiums on his friends, or strong opprobrious language in speaking of his and their enemies, the unprovoked persecutors of his church. He allows the facts which he has recorded to speak for both, and transmit to posterity a memorial to their honour or their infamy.\n\nThe chief fault of this historical collection already hinted at, is its minuteness, and excessive copiousness. The prodigious multitude of facts it embraces, though different from one another in their circumstances, are in other respects somewhat similar. This must necessarily occasion some repetition and lateness, especially to a fatigued reader, who has it, however, in his power to gratify his taste by selecting what is most agreeable to it. Nevertheless a candid and patient reader can be at no loss to form a proper judgement of the principal transactions of the period, from the authentic accounts of them before him, to appreciate the true characters of the actors, or of the motives and views from which they acted. And an inquisitive and penetrating reader will be gratified by seeing not a little of the peculiar principles, opinions, sentiments, habits, and manners of that age, as distinguished from the present; and may thus estimate the gradual progress towards much noble and useful improvement; and on the other hand, the progress towards a very hurtful corruption and degeneracy of manners, which have both taken place during the last hundred and twenty years.\n\nAt the time of its first publication, the book met with less general attention than might have been expected in Scotland, and scarcely any attention in England, except from professed readers. As it came to be more studied, it was the more valued, except where there was an evident bias on the opposite side. Few can be at a loss to see why such historians as Hume, Macpherson, and Dalrymple should neglect or undervalue such a book. Our later Scotch historians, Somerville and Laing, have done it more justice. In truth, there is a very near coincidence in their estimates of the characters they draw, and their accounts of the facts they relate, in common with Wodrow. But especially our late illustrious patriot Charles Fox, whose high abilities, uncommon candour, and sweetness of disposition, almost remove the suspected bias of his party spirit\u2014Mr Fox has, in the historical fragment published since his death, given a very honourable testimony to the fidelity and accuracy of our historian. After mentioning the execution of three females, he adds, page 131, \"To relate all the instances of cruelty which occurred would be endless. But it may be necessary to remark, that no historical facts are better ascertained, than the accounts of them which are to be found in Wodrow. In every instance, where there has been an opportunity of comparing these accounts with the records, and other authentic monuments, they appear to be quite correct.\"\n\nThe collection of the materials for writing the church history from the public records, and many other authentic sources, must have cost the author a prodigious labour and time. The pecuniary expense incurred was considerable, and scarcely refunded from the sale of the book. The only net profit, he has been heard to say, which accrued from it, was one or two hundred pounds that he received from the king, to whom it was dedicated.\n\nThe last twelve years of Mr Wodrow's life were chiefly occupied in drawing up a biography of the principal persons concerned in introducing the reformation of religion into Scotland, and settling the different forms or modes of ecclesiastical government attempted to be established there from the beginning to the end of that period, namely from about the year 1560 to 1660, when the printed history of the sufferings commences. Had it pleased God to continue his useful life till this larger work was finished, public curiosity would have been much gratified; for it contains the lives, not only of John Knox, George Buchanan, and others already well known, but the lives of a great number more, very learned.\nWodrow, learned, ingenious, respectable, and worthy men, scarcely at all known to the literary world; besides a variety of anecdotes naturally entering into such a work, illustrative of the history and the living manners of that age. Happily these manuscript lives are still preserved, all written with his own pen, and some of the longest of them copied, probably during his last long illness, in a more legible hand. Whatever important or curious information they may contain, they are not fit for the press in their present state. They are now deposited in the library of the university of Glasgow.\n\nBesides writing the history and the biography, both extended by himself for publication, and two days every week regularly appropriated to his preparation for the pulpit, much of his time must have been occasionally spent in writing letters, some of them like dissertations, on theological and other literary subjects; for he corresponded with a very wide circle of acquaintances and friends in Scotland, England, and Ireland, and with a few on the continent and in North America.\n\nHis constitution in the first part of life was robust and strong, his health in general good; but his studious habits or constant reading, and especially incessant writing, it is supposed, may have brought on the bodily complaint which occasioned his death. In the latter end of the year 1731, a swelling about the size of a small chestnut appeared on his breast, near the collar bone. It was on the same place where a spark of fire had fallen when he was a child, and had then left a little lump and hardness like a large pea. About a month after the swelling began, it had increased to the size of a plum, and in April 1732 was as large as a man's fist. It was attempted to be removed by cautery; the attempt failed. His body became greatly emaciated, and he gradually declined till his death, which happened on the 21st of March 1734. Supported by the testimony of a good conscience, joined with the strong consolation and well-founded hope of the gospel, he bore this long-continued severe distress with admirable fortitude, unabated piety and resignation; never uttering a murmur, but behaving to his friends who came to see him, and to all about him, with much ease and affection; thus leaving, both in the active exertions of a useful life, and in his patient sufferings at the close of it, a very edifying example to his family and his flock. The day before his death, he gathered his children around his bed, gave each of them his dying blessing, with counsels suitable to their ages and circumstances; last of all two boys, neither of them four years old, too young to understand and feel these marks of his affection, yet, after the example of the venerable patriarch, Gen. xlviii. 15, even them he drew to him, laid his hands upon their heads, and devoutly prayed, that the God of his fathers, the angel who had redeemed him from all evil, would bless the lads.\n\nMr Wodrow was married in the end of 1708, to Margaret Warner, grand daughter of the reverend Mr William Guthrie of Penwick, well known in Scotland by his writings, and daughter of the reverend Patrick Warner, then living on his estate of Ardeer in Ayrshire. Mr Warner, in the early part of his life, had been chaplain to the East India Company at Madras. After his return home, he was driven from his ministry and from the kingdom, by the persecution of the privy council; but returned in consequence of King James's indulgence, and became minister of Irvine. He had a personal interview on his last return with the prince of Orange at the Hague, a short time before the history, an account of which appears in the history, vol. ii. p. 604. Mr Wodrow had a family of 16 children, nine of whom, with his widow, survived him in decent circumstances, without any breach among them for above 25 years. The only remaining survivor is the reverend Dr James Wodrow of Stevenston in Ayrshire.\n\nBesides his collection of foths, and a few Roman and British medals, Mr Wodrow left a valuable library of books, many volumes of pamphlets and also of manuscripts written by others; sent to him in presents, or copied by his orders. The most valuable part of them is now in the advocates library, and in the repositories of the church at Edinburgh. His own manuscript biography, as has been already said, is in the library of the university of Glasgow.","sp":422,"ep":426},{"h":"WOLAW","t":"a town in Germany, in Silesia, and capital of a duchy of the same name.

His father was Lieutenant-general Edward Wolfe. He went into the army when very young; and applying himself with unrewarded assiduity to the study of his profession, soon became remarkable for his knowledge and his genius. He distinguished himself at the battle of Laffert when little more than 20, and received the highest encomiums from the commander-in-chief. After the peace he still continued to cultivate the art of war. He contrived to introduce the greatest regularity and the exactest discipline into his corps, and at the same time to preserve the affection of every soldier. In 1758 he was present as a brigadier-general at the siege of Louisbourg. He landed first on the island at the head of division; and in spite of the violence of the surf, and the force and well directed fire of the enemy, drove them from their post with great precipitation. The surrender of the town, which happened soon after, was in a great measure owing to his activity, bravery, and skill. The fame which he acquired during this siege pointed him out to Mr Pitt, who was then minister, as the properest person to command the army destined to attack Quebec. This was the most difficult and the most arduous undertaking of the whole war. Quebec was the capital of the French dominions in North America; it was well fortified, situated in the midst of a hostile country, and defended by an army of 20,000 men, regulars and militia, besides a considerable number of Indian allies. The troops destined for this expedition consisted of ten battalions, making up altogether about 7000 men. Such was the army\narmy destined to oppose three times their own number, defended by fortifications, in a country altogether unknown, and in a late season in that climate for military operations. But this little army, says an officer who was present at that expedition, and who has been so obliging as to communicate all the information we desired, was always languishing of success; for they were commanded by General Wolfe, who, by a very uncommon magnanimity and nobleness of behaviour, had attached the troops so much to his person, and inspired them with such resolution and steadiness in the execution of their duty, that nothing seemed too difficult for them to accomplish. The admirable skill with which his measures were planned, and the prudence and vigour with which they were executed, are well known. He landed his army on the northern shore of the river St Lawrence in spite of the enemy, and forced them to a battle, in which they were completely defeated. The consequence of this battle was the reduction of Quebec, and the conquest of Canada. In the beginning of the battle General Wolfe was wounded in the wrist by a musket-ball; he wrapped his handkerchief round it, continued to give his orders with his usual calmness and perspicuity, and informed the soldiers that the advanced parties on the front had his orders to retire, and that they needed not be surprised when it happened. Towards the end of the battle he received a new wound in the breast; he immediately retired behind the rear-rank supported by a grenadier, and laid himself down on the ground. Soon after a shout was heard; and one of the officers who stood by him exclaimed, \"See how they run!\" The dying hero asked with some emotion, \"Who run?\" \"The enemy (replied the officer); they give way everywhere.\" The general then said, \"Pray, do one of you run to Colonel Burton, and tell him to march Webb's regiment with all speed down to Charles river, to cut off the retreat of the fugitives from the bridge.\" Now, God be praised, I shall die happy!\" He then turned on his side, closed his eyes, and expired.\n\nThe death of General Wolfe was a national loss universally lamented. He inherited from nature an animating fervour of sentiment, an intuitive perception, an extensive capacity, and a passion for glory, which stimulated him to acquire every species of military knowledge that study could comprehend, that actual service could illustrate and confirm. This noble warmth of disposition seldom fails to call forth and unfold all the liberal virtues of the soul. Brave above all estimation of danger; generous, gentle, complacent, and humane; the pattern of the officer, the darling of the soldier. There was a sublimity in his genius which soared above the pitch of ordinary minds; and had his faculties been exercised to their full extent by opportunity and action, had his judgement been fully matured by age and experience, he would, without doubt, have rivalled in reputation the most celebrated captains of antiquity. His body was brought to England, and buried with military honours in Westminster abbey, where a magnificent monument is erected to his memory.\n\nWolfe, Christian, a celebrated German philosopher, was born at Breitau in 1679. After having been well instructed in the rudiments of learning and science in his own country, Wolfe prosecuted his studies successively in the universities of Jena, Hamburgh, and Leipzig. At the age of 26 he had acquired so much distinction, that he was appointed professor of mathematics, and soon afterwards of philosophy in general, in the university of Hall. After Leibnitz had published his Thodicea, Wolfe struck with the novelty of the edifice which that philosopher had raised, assiduously laboured in the investigation of new metaphysical truths. He also digested the Elements of Mathematics in a new method, and attempted an improvement of the art of reasoning, in a treatise On the Powers of the Human Understanding. Upon the foundation of Leibnitz's doctrine of Monads, he formed a new system of Cosmology and Pneumatology, digested and demonstrated in a mathematical method. This work, entitled Thoughts on God, the World, and the Human Soul, was published in the year 1710; to which were added, in a subsequent edition, Heads of Ethics and Policy.\n\nWolfe was now rising towards the summit of philosophical reputation, when the opinion which he entertained on the doctrine of necessity being deemed by his colleagues inimical to religion, and an oration which he delivered in praise of the morality of the Chinese having given much offence, an accusation of heresy was publicly brought against him; and, though he attempted to justify himself in a treatise which he wrote on the subject of fatality, a royal mandate was issued in November 1723, requiring him to leave the Prussian dominions. Having been formerly invited by the landgrave of Hesse-Cassel to fill a professor's chair in the university of Cassel, Wolfe now put himself under the patronage of that prince, who had the liberality to afford him a secure asylum, and appointed him professor of mathematics and philosophy. The question concerning the grounds of the censure which had been passed upon Wolfe was now everywhere freely canvassed; almost every German university was inflamed with disputes on the subject of liberty and necessity; and the names of Wolfians and Anti-Wolfians were everywhere heard. After an interval of nine years, the king of Prussia reversed his sentence of exile, and appointed him vice-chancellor of the university of Hall, where his return was welcomed with every expression of triumph. From this time he was employed in completing his Institutes of Philosophy, which he lived to accomplish in every branch except poetry. In 1745 he was created a baron by the elector of Bavaria, and succeeded Ludovig in the office of chancellor of the university. He continued to enjoy these honours till the year 1754, when he expired. He possessed a clear and methodical understanding; which, by long exercise in mathematical investigations, was particularly fitted for the employment of digesting the several branches of knowledge into regular systems; and his fertile powers of invention enabled him to enrich almost every field of science in which he laboured, with some valuable additions. The lucid order which appears in all his writings enables his reader to follow his conceptions with ease and certainty, through the longest trains of reasoning.\n\nWolfenbuttle, a considerable town of Germany, in the circle of Lower Saxony, and duchy of Brunswick, with a castle where the duke of Brunswick Wolfenbuttle resides.

He was in 1674 admitted a pensioner in Sidney college, Cambridge, where, notwithstanding several disadvantages, he acquired a great degree of reputation. In 1682, seeing no prospect of preferment, he became assistant to the head master of Birmingham school. Some time after, he got a small lecture about two miles distant, but did the duty the whole Sunday; which, together with the business of a great free-school for about four years, began to break his constitution. During this space he likewise underwent a great deal of trouble and uneasiness, in order to extricate two of his brothers from some inconveniences, to which their own imprudence had subjected them. In 1688 affairs took a new turn. He found himself by a cousin's will entitled to a very ample estate; and came to London that same year, where he settled; choosing a private, retired, and studious life. Not long before his death, he published his treatise, entitled The Religion of Nature Delineated; a work for which so great a demand was made, that more than 10,000 were sold in a very few years. He had scarcely completed the publication of it, when he unfortunately broke an arm; and this adding strength to distempers that had been growing upon him for some time, accelerated his death; which happened upon the 29th of October 1724. He was a tender, humane, and in all respects worthy man; but is represented to have had something of the irascible in his constitution and temperament. His Religion of Nature Delineated exposed him to some censure, as if he had put a slight upon Christianity, by laying so much stress, as he does in this work, upon the obligations of truth, reason, and virtue; and by making no mention of revealed religion. But this censure must have been the offspring of ignorance or envy, since it appears from the introduction to his work, that he intended to treat of revealed religion in a second part, which he lived not to finish.","sp":428,"ep":428},{"h":"WOLSEY","t":"Thomas, a famous cardinal and archbishop of York, is said to have been the son of a butcher at Ipswich. He studied at Magdalen college, Oxford, where he became acquainted with the learned Erasmus; and in the year 1500 became rector of Lymington in Somersetshire: he was afterwards made chaplain to King Henry VIII. and obtained several preferments. Having gradually acquired an entire ascendancy over the mind of Henry VIII. he successively obtained several bishoprics, and at length was made archbishop of York, lord high chancellor of England, and prime minister; and was for several years the arbiter of Europe. Pope Leo X. created him cardinal in 1513, and made him legate a latere; and the emperor Charles V. and the French king Francis I. loaded him with favours, in order to gain him over to their interest; but after having first sided with the emperor, he deserted him to espouse the interest of France. As his revenues were immense, his pride and ostentation were carried to the greatest height. He had 500 servants; among whom were 9 or 10 lords, 15 knights, and 40 esquires. His ambition to be pope, his pride, his exactions, and his political delay of Henry's divorce, occasioned his disgrace. In the earlier part of his life he seems to have been licentious in his manners; it was reported, that soon after his preferment to the living of Lymington in Somersetshire, he was put into the stocks by Sir Amias Paulet, a neighbouring justice of the peace, for getting drunk and making a riot at a fair. This treatment Wolsey did not forget when he arrived at the high station of lord-chancellor of England; but summoned his corrector up to London, and, after a severe reprimand, enjoined him five years close confinement in the Temple. Whatever may have been his faults, there can be no doubt of their having been aggravated both by the zealous reformers and by the creatures of Henry VIII. who was himself neither Papist nor Protestant; for there is every reason to believe that the cardinal was sincere in his religion; and sincerity, or at least constancy, was then a crime. Wolsey was the patron of learned men; a judge and munificent encourager of the polite arts; and ought to be considered as the founder of Christchurch college, Oxford; where, as well as in other places, many remains of his magnificent ideas in architecture still exist.

It is composed of a number of concentric circles or zones, one of which is formed every year; consequently their number corresponds to the age of the tree. These zones vary in thickness according to the degree of vegetation that took place the year of their formation. They are also of different degrees of thickness in different parts, that part of the tree which is most exposed to the sun and best sheltered growing fastest; hence in this country that part of the zone which looked towards the south while the tree was growing is generally thickest. The innermost circle or zone is the one which was first formed, the outermost was formed the year before the tree was cut down. These zones are at first very soft and tender, and harden by degrees as the tree becomes older; this is the reason that the middle of a tree is so often much better wood than the outside of it.\n\nThe proper ligneous part of the wood consists of longitudinal fibres, disposed in fasciculi, and possessed of considerable hardness. It is this longitudinal direction of the fibres that renders it so much easier to cleave wood lengthwise, than across the tree, or in any other direction. See Plant and Vegetable Physiology.\n\nFor an account of the ingredients which enter into the composition of wood, see Chemistry Index.\n\nFor the Method of Staining or Dyeing Wood see Turning.\n\nFor more complete information concerning wood, see also Tree, and Strength of Materials.\n\nFossil Wood. Fossil wood, or whole trees, or parts of them, are very frequently found buried in the earth, and that in different strata; sometimes in stone, but more usually in earth; and sometimes in small pieces loose among the gravel. These, according to the time they have lain in the earth, or the matter they have lain among, are found differently altered from their original state; some of them having suffered very little change; and others being so highly impregnated with crystalline, sparry, pyritical, or other extraneous matter, as to appear mere masses of stone, or lumps of the common matter of the pyrites, &c., of the dimensions, and more or less, of the internal figure, of the vegetable bodies into the pores of which they have made their way.\n\nThe fossil woods have been arranged by Dr Hill into three kinds: 1. The less altered; 2. The pyritical; and, 3. The petrified.\n\nOf the trees, or parts of them, less altered from their original state, the greatest store is found in digging to small depths in bogs, and among what is called peat or turf earth, a substance used in many parts of the kingdom for fuel. In digging among this, usually very near the surface, immense quantities of vegetable matter of various kinds are found buried; in some places there are whole trees scarcely altered, except in colour; the oaks in particular being usually turned to a jetty black; the pines and firs, which are also very frequent, are less altered, and are as inflammable as ever, and often contain between the bark and wood a black resin. Large parts of trees have also been not unfrequently met with unaltered in beds of another kind, and at much greater depths, as in strata of clay and loam, among gravel, and sometimes even in solid stone.\n\nBesides these harder parts of trees, there are frequently found also in the peat earth vast quantities of the leaves and fruit and catkins of the hazel and similar trees; these are usually mixed with sedge and roots of grass, and are scarce at all altered from their usual texture. The most common of these are hazel-nuts; but there are frequently found also the twigs and leaves of the white poplar; and a little deeper usually there lies a cracked and shattered wood, the crevices of which are full of a bituminous black matter; and among this the stones of plums and other stone-fruits are sometimes found, but more rarely.\n\nIn this state the fruits and larger parts of trees are usually found; what we find of them more altered, are sometimes large and long, sometimes smaller and shorter branches of trees; sometimes small fragments of branches, and more frequently small shapeless pieces of wood. The larger and longer branches are usually found bedded in the strata of stone, and are more or less altered into the nature of the stratum they lie in. The shorter and smaller branches are found in vast variety in the strata of blue clay used for making tiles in the neighbourhood of London. These are prodigiously plentiful in all the clay-pits of this kind, and usually carry the whole external resemblance of what they once were, but nothing of the inner structure; their pores being wholly filled, and undistinguishably cloed, by the matter of the common pyrites, so as to appear mere simple masses of that matter. These fall to pieces on being long exposed to moisture; and are so impregnated with vitriol that they are what is principally used for making the green vitriol or copperas at Deptford and other places.\n\nThe irregular masses or fragments of petrified wood are principally of oak, and are most usually found among gravel; though sometimes in other strata. These are variously altered by the infiltration of crystalline and flinty particles; and make a very beautiful figure when cut and polished, as they usually keep the regular grain of the wood, and show exactly the several circles which mark the different years growth. These, according to the different matter which has filled their pores, assume various colours, and the appearance of the various fossils that have impregnated them; some are perfectly white, and but moderately hard; others of a brownish black, or perfectly black, and much harder; others of a reddish black, others yellowish, and others greyish, and some of a ferruginous colour. They are of different weights also and hardnesses, according to the nature and quantity of the flinty particles they contain: of these some pieces have been found with every pore filled with pure pellucid crystal; and others in large masses, part of which is wholly petrified and seems mere stone, while the rest is crumbling and is unaltered wood. That this alteration is made in wood, even at this time, is also abundantly proved by the instances of wood being put into the hollows of mines, as props and supports to the roofs, which is found after a number of years as truly petrified as that which is dug up from the natural strata of the earth. In the pieces of petrified wood found in Germany, there are frequently veins of spar or of pure crystal, sometimes of earthy substances, and often of the matter of the common pebbles: these fragments of wood sometimes have the appearance of parts of the branches of trees in their natural state, but more frequently they resemble pieces of broken boards; these are usually capable of a high and elegant polish.\nWood. Many substances, it is certain, have been preserved in the cabinets of collectors, under the title of petrified wood, which have very little right to that name. But where the whole outer figure of the wood, the exact lineaments of the bark, or the fibrous and fleshy texture of the fibre, and the vestiges of the utriculi and tracheae or air-vessels, are yet remaining, and the several circles yet visible which denoted the several years growth of the tree, none can deny these substances to be real fossil wood.\n\nSee Petrification.\n\nDr Parry of Bath has recently investigated the causes of the decay of wood, and the means of preventing it. For this purpose he recommends the application of a preparation of the resinous kind, mixed with a certain portion of bees-wax. The proportion of the ingredients and the mode of mixing them are as follows: Take 12 ounces of rosin and 8 ounces of roll brimstone, each coarsely powdered, and 3 gallons of train oil; heat them slowly, gradually adding 4 ounces of bees-wax, cut into small bits. Frequently stir the liquor, which, as soon as the solid ingredients are dissolved, will be fit for use. It is recommended to dress every part of the woodwork with this composition twice over before the parts are put together, and once afterwards; and a higher state of preservation is promised from its use than has yet been attained. It should be observed, that in preparing this varnish, it is advisable, in order to prevent accidents, to use an earthen vessel, and to make the fire in the open air.\n\nWood (Cylica), in Ancient Geography, a multitude of trees extended over a large continued tract of land, and propagated without culture. The generality of woods only consist of trees of one kind.\u2014The ancient Saxons had such a veneration for woods, that they made them sanctuaries.\u2014It is ordained, that none shall destroy any wood, by turning it into tillage or pasture, &c., where there are two acres or more in quantity, on pain of forfeiting 40s. an acre, by 35 Henry VIII. c. 17. All woods that are felled at 14 years growth, are to be preserved from destruction for eight years; and no cattle put into the ground till five years after the felling thereof, &c. 13 Eliz. c. 25. The burning of woods or underwood is declared to be felony; also those persons that maliciously cut or spoil timber-trees, or any fruit-trees, &c., shall be sent to the house of correction, there to be kept three months, and whipt once a month.\n\nWood, Engraving on, is commonly executed on box; and in many cases, engravings of this kind are used with advantage instead of copperplates. The art of cutting or engraving on wood is of very high antiquity; for Chinese printing is a specimen of it. Even in Europe, if credit be due to Papillon, this art was practised at a very remote period; for he mentions eight engravings on wood, entitled, \"A representation of the warlike actions of the great and magnanimous Macedonian king, the bold and valiant Alexander; dedicated, presented, and humbly offered, to the most holy father, Pope Honorius IV., by us Alexander Albertus Cunio Chevalier, and Isabella Cunio, &c.\" This anecdote, if true, carries the art of cutting in wood back to 1284 or 1285; for Honorius occupied the papal throne only during these two years. But this is not the remotest period to which some have carried the art in Europe; for the use of seals or signets being of very high antiquity, they imagine that the invention of wood-cuts must be coeval with them. The supposition is certainly plausible, but it is not supported by proof. The earliest impression of a wooden-cut, of which there is any certain account, is that of St Christopher carrying an infant Jesus through the sea, in which a hermit is seen holding up a lanthorn to show him the way; and a peasant, with a sack on his back, climbing a hill, is exhibited in the background. The date of this impression is 1423. In the year 1430 was printed at Haerlem, \"The history of St John the evangelist and his revelations, represented in 48 figures in wood, by Lowrent Janzon Cofter;\" and, in 1438, Jorg Schappf of Augsburg cut in wood the history of the Apocalypse, and what was called The poor man's bible.\n\nA folio chronicle, published 1493 by Schedel, was adorned with a great number of wooden-cuts by William Pleydenwurff and Michael Wolgemut, whose engravings were greatly superior to any thing of the kind which had appeared before them. The latter was the preceptor of Albert Durer, whose admirable performances in this department of art are justly held in the highest esteem even at the present day.\n\nAbout this period it became the practice of almost all the German engravers on copper to engrave likewise on wood; and many of their wood cuts surpass in beauty the impressions of their copperplates. Such are the wood-cuts of Albert Aldtorter, Hithel Pen, Virgil Soles, Lucas Van Cranach, and Lucas Van Leyden, the friend and imitator of Albert Durer, with several others.\n\nThe Germans carried this art to a great degree of perfection. Hans or John Holbein, who flourished in 1509, engraved the Dance of Death, in a series of wooden-cuts, which, for the freedom and delicacy of execution, have scarcely been equalled, and never surpassed. Italy, France, and Holland, have produced capital artists of this kind. Joan Tornasum printed a bible at Leyden, in 1554, with wooden-cuts of excellent workmanship. Christopher Jegher of Antwerp, from his eminence in the art, was employed by Rubens to work under his inspection, and he executed several pieces which are held in much estimation; they are particularly distinguished for boldness and spirit.\n\nThe next attempt at improvement in this art was by Hugo da Carpi, to whom is attributed the invention of the chiaro scuro. Carpi was an Italian, and of the 16th century; but the Germans claim the invention also, and produce in evidence several engravings by Mair, a disciple of Martin Schoen, of date 1499. His mode of performing this was very simple. He first engraved the subject upon copper, and finished it as much as the artists of his time usually did. He then prepared a block of wood, upon which he cut out the extreme lights, and then impressed it upon the print; by which means a faint tint was added to all the rest of the piece, excepting only in those parts where the lights were meant to predominate, which appear on the specimens extant to be coloured with white paint. The drawings for this species of engraving were made on tinted paper with a pen, and the lights were drawn upon the paper with white paint.\n\nBut there is a material difference between the chiaro scuro of the old German masters and that of the Italians. Mair and Cranach engraved the outlines and deep\ndeep shadows upon copper. The impression taken in this state was tinted over by means of a single block of wood, with those parts hollowed out which were designed to be left white upon the print. On the contrary, the mode of engraving by Hugo da Carpi was, to cut the outline on one block of wood, the dark shadows upon a second, and the light shadows, or half-tint, upon a third. The first being impressed upon the paper, the outlines only appeared; this block being taken away, the second was put in its place, and being also impressed on the paper, the dark shadows were added to the outlines; and the third block being put in the same place upon the removal of the second, and also impressed upon the paper, made the dim tints, when the print was completed. In some instances, the number of blocks was increased, but the operation was still the same, the print receiving an impression from every block.\n\nIn 1698, John Baptist Michel Papillon practised engraving on wood with much success, particularly in ornamental foliage and flowers, shells, &c. In the opinion, however, of some of the most eminent artists, his performances are stiff and cramped. From that period the art of engraving on wood gradually degenerated, and may be said to have been wholly lost, when it was lately re-invented by Mr Bewick of Newcastle. This eminent artist was apprentice to Mr Bielby, a respectable engraver on metal. Mr Bielby, who was accustomed to employ his apprentices in engraving on wood, was much gratified with the performance of Thomas Bewick, and therefore advised him to prosecute engraving in that line. The advice was followed; and young Bewick inventing tools, even making them with his own hands, and sawing the wood on which he was to work into the requisite thickness, proceeded to improve upon his own discoveries, without assistance or instruction of any kind. When his apprenticeship expired, he went to London, where the obscure wood-engravers of the time wished to avail themselves of his abilities, while they were determined to give him no insight into their art. During his apprenticeship, he received from the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, &c. a premium of considerable value for the best engraving in wood. The cut which obtained the premium was one of a series for an edition of Gay's Fables. Having remained some years in London, he returned to Newcastle, and entered into partnership with his old master; and established his reputation as an artist by the publication of his admirable History of Quadrupeds. This was followed by his History of Birds, in 2 vols. The greater part of the volume on Quadrupeds, and the whole of the first volume of the work on Birds, was composed by Mr Bielby.\n\nJohn Bewick, brother to Thomas, learned the art of him, and practised it for several years in London with great applause. His abilities, however, though respectable, were not, by the best judges, deemed so brilliant as his brother's; and owing to bad health, and the nature of his connection with the bookellers and others, he seems not to have advanced the art beyond the stage at which he received it. He died, some years ago, at Newcastle.\n\nMr Nelbit, who executed the admirable cuts from designs by Thornton, for an edition of Hudibras, as well as the cuts for editions of Shakespeare and Thomson's Seasons, and Mr Anderson, whose beautiful cuts adorn the poem entitled Grove Hill, have been the most successful of Thomas Bewick's pupils, who have appeared before the public as artists. It appears, that the method practised by the ancient engravers of wood, whose works are still admired, must have been different from that of Bewick and his pupils. What that method was seems to be altogether unknown. Papillon, who writes the best history extant of the art, gives indeed in what manner the old engravers proceeded so as to give to their works the spirit and freedom for which they are famed; but that his guesses are erroneous seems evident from the stiffness of his own works. The principal characteristic in the mechanical department of the productions of the ancient masters is the crossing of the black lines, which Papillon has attempted with the greatest awkwardness, though it seems to have been accomplished by them with so much ease, that they introduced it at random, even where it could add nothing to the beauty of the piece. In Bewick's method of working, this cross hatching is so difficult and unnatural, that it may be considered as impracticable. Mr Nelbit has indeed introduced something of it into two or three of his pieces; but so great was the labour, and so little the advantage of this improvement, if such it can be called, that probably it will not be attempted again.\n\nThe engravers of Bewick's school work on the end of the wood, which is cut across the trunk of the tree, in pieces of the proper thickness. As wood-cuts are generally employed in the printer's press amidst a form of types, this thickness must be regulated by the height of the types with which they are to be used. The tools employed are nearly the same with those used in copperplate engraving, being only a little more deep, or lozenge, as engravers call it. They must have points of various degrees of fineness for the different purposes to which they are applied, some of them being so much rounded off at the bottom as to approach to the nature of a gouge, whilst others are in fact little chisels of various sizes. These chisels and gouges, to which every artist gives the shape which he deems most convenient, are held in the hand in a manner somewhat different from the tool of the engraver on copper, it being necessary to have the power of lifting the chips upwards with ease. To attempt a description of this in writing would be in vain; but it is easily acquired, we are told, by practice.\n\nThe pupils of the school of Bewick consider it as quite improper to speak of his invention as a revival of the ancient art. Some old prints, it is true, have the appearance of being executed in the same way with his; but others have certainly been done by a method very different. It is therefore not fair to appreciate the present art by what has been done, but by what may be done; and that remains yet to be shown. The art is in its infancy; and those who are disposed to compare it with the art of engraving on copper, ought to look back to the period when copperplate engraving was of as recent invention as Bewick's method of engraving on wood. Marc Antonio, who engraved under the direction of the great painter Raphael, thought it no mean proof of his proficiency in his art, that he was able to imitate on copperplates the wood-cuts of Albert Durer; and Papillon is highly indignant that there should have been persons so very blind as to mistake the copies for the originals. If copper has its advantages,\nvantages over wood in point of delicacy and minute-\nnels, wood has, in its turn, advantages not inferior in\nregard to strength and richness. Those prints which\nwere executed under the auspices of Titian and Ru-\nbens, will always remain a monument of the spirit and\nvigour natural to wood-engraving; and if there be not\nfound in them all the attention to chiaro scuro, which\nthe present age demands, it must not be attributed ei-\nther to defect in the art, or to want of abilities in the\nartists, but to the taste of the times when chiaro scuro\nwas little understood. It remains for some enterprising\nartist to show that the vigour of the ancient art may be\nattained by the present one, and at the same time to\nadd to that vigour those gradations of shade which are\nso much admired in good copperplates. As there seems\nto be a more perfect, or at least a more pleasant black\nproduced by wood than by copperplate printing, and\ncertainly a more perfect white (A), who will say that\nany intermediate shade whatever may not be produced\nby wood-cuts? To attempt this on a small scale would\nindeed be vain, because the flighty variation, produced\nby a little more or less ink, or a harder pressure in\nprinting, bears such a proportion to a very short line, as\nmust necessarily render the attempt abortive.\n\nWood-engraving, therefore, must always appear to\ndisadvantage while it is confined to small subjects, and\nwill never reach its station as a fine art, till those who\nare engaged in its cultivation improve upon the disco-\nveries of one another, and apply to subjects to which it\nis properly adapted. As an economical art for illustrat-\ning mechanics, various branches of natural history, and\nother subjects of science, it is too little employed even\nin its present state.\n\nThe works of Bewick and his pupils, which have\nhitherto been published, are not numerous.

This is a subject\nwhich has often been discussed by naturalists. Spallan-\nzani maintained, that there is a perfect analogy between\nthe illumination of rotten wood, and artificial phos-\nphorus; and he imagines, that in the putrid fermenta-\ntion, the hydrogen and the carbure of the wood come\nmore easily in contact with the oxygen of the atmos-\nphere, by which combination a slow combustion, and\nthe illumination of the wood, is produced; and he\nthinks that this process cannot proceed in the irrespire-\nble kinds of gases. Rotten wood also, in which the ne-\ncessary quantity of hydrogen and carbure is not at the\nsame time disengaged, does not obtain the property of\nilluminating. Mr Corrado, however, objects to this\ntheory, that the slow combustion does not take place ac-\ncording to the above theory, as the wood, at the time\nwhen it begins to illuminate, is mostly deprived of its\nresinous particles, and consequently contains but very\nlittle hydrogen and carbure; and it appears to him\nmore probable, that the more it loses of combustible\nmatter, the more it obtains the property of illuminating.\nThere is, he thinks, a very great difference between\nthis natural and the artificial phosphorus. Mr Hum-\nboldt concludes, from his experiments, that the illumi-\nnation of rotten wood takes place only when it gets into\ncontact with oxygen; and when it has lost the property\nof emitting light in irrespirable gases, it recovers it\nagain by exposing it to oxygen gas. Dr Gartner, how-\never, is of opinion, that, according to his experiments,\na certain degree of humidity is always requisite, and he\nthinks that oxygen gas is not quite necessary though the\nillumination be increased by it. This phenomenon,\nhowever, being so very different from all known pro-\ncesses of combustion, where light is disengaged, Dr\nGartner asks, whether it be not more agreeing with the\nanimal process of respiration, than with a true combus-\ntion, or whether the illumination of the wood be produced\nby phosphorus and carbure in a proportion hitherto un-\nknown. Dr Gartner is, on the whole, inclined to\nthink, that it is at present impossible to give a satisfac-\ntory explanation of all the phenomena that occur in this\nprocess. Beckmann has made numerous experiments on\nthe illumination of rotten wood, in different gases and\nfluids, in order to throw some light on the ideas of the\nabove naturalists. The results of these experiments dif-\nfer in some points from what the experiments of those\ngentlemen have shown, which, however, Beckmann\nattributes to the nature of rotten wood, as a substance\nthat is not always of the same kind, and has not always\nan equal degree of putrefaction and humidity. It seems\nalso to differ materially from the artificial phosphorus in\nthe following particulars. 1. It shines in oxygen gas at\na very low temperature. 2. It emits light in all irre-\nspirable gases, at least for a short time. 3. In muriatic\nacid gas its light is suddenly extinguished. 4. It shines\nin a less degree in air rarefied by the air-pump. 5. Ac-\ncording to Mr Corrado, it even shines in the torricellian\nvacuum. 6. Its illumination is extinguished in oxy-\ngen gas, as well as in other kinds of gases, when they\nare heated. 7. By its illumination in oxygen gas, car-\nbonic acid gas is produced. 8. One may suffer the rotten\nwood to be extinguished several times, one after an-\nother, in irrespirable gases, without depriving them of\nthe property of making new pieces of rotten wood shine\nagain. 9. Humidity greatly promotes the illumination,\nand even seems to be necessary in producing it. 10. The\nrotten wood continues to shine under water, oil, and\nother fluids, and in some of them its light is even in-\ncreased. All this seems to show, that the extinction of\nrotten wood, in different media, does not immediately\ndepend on a want of oxygen, but rather on a particular\nchange, to which the wood itself has been exposed.\n\nWOOD-Cock.

See OVIS and SHEEP.\n\nWool resembles hair in a great many particulars; but besides its fineness, which constitutes an obvious difference, there are other particulars which may serve also to distinguish them from one another. Wool, like the hair of horses, cattle, and most other animals, completes its growth in a year, and then falls off as hair does, and is succeeded by a fresh crop. It differs from hair, however, in the uniformity of its growth, and the regularity of its shedding. Every filament of wool seems to keep exact pace with another in the same part of the body of the animal; the whole crop springs up at once; the whole advances uniformly together; the whole loosens from the skin nearly at the same period, and thus falls off, if not previously shorn, leaving the animal covered with a short coat of young wool, which in its turn undergoes the same regular mutations.\n\nHairs are commonly of the same thickness in every part; but wool constantly varies in thickness in different parts, being generally thicker at the points than at the roots. That part of the fleece of sheep which grows during the winter is finer than what grows in summer. This was first observed by Dr Anderson, the editor of the Bee, and published in his Observations on the Means of exciting a Spirit of National Industry.\n\nWhile the wool remains in the state it was first shorn off the sheep's back, and not sorted into its different kinds, it is called fleece. Each fleece consists of wool of diverse qualities and degrees of fineness, which the dealers therein take care to separate. The French and English usually separate each fleece into three sorts, viz. 1. Mother-wool, which is that of the back and neck. 2. The wool of the tails and legs. 3. That of the breast and under the belly. The Spaniards make the like division into three sorts, which they call prime, second and third; and for the greater ease, mark each bale or pack with a capital letter, denoting the sort. If the triage or separation be well made, in 15 bales there will be 12 marked R, that is, refine, or prime; two marked F, for fine, or second; and one S, for thirds.\n\nThe wools most esteemed are the English, chiefly those about Leominster, Cotswold, and the Isle of Wight; the Spanish, principally those about Segovia; and the French, about Berry: which last are said to have this peculiar property, that they will knot or bind with any other sort; whereas the rest will only knot with their own kind.\n\nAmong the ancients, the wools of Attica, Megara, Laodicea, Apulia, and especially those of Tarentum, Parma, and Altino, were the most valued. Varro assures us, that the people there used to clothe their sheep with skins, to secure the wool from being damaged.\n\nOf late a great deal of attention has been paid to wool in this country, as well as several others. Several very spirited attempts have been made to improve it, by introducing superior breeds of sheep, and better methods of managing them. For this purpose has been formed the British Wool Society, an association formed for the purpose of obtaining the best breeds of fine-wooled sheep, with a view of ascertaining, by actual experiments, how far each species or variety is calculated for the climate of Great Britain; the qualities of their wool respectively; the uses to which each kind of wool could be most profitably employed in different manufactures; and the comparative value of each species of sheep, so far as the same can be determined.\n\nAttention had for some time been paid by the Highland Society to a famous breed of fine-wooled sheep in Shetland; but it occurred to Sir John Sinclair of Ulbster, baronet, and to Dr James Anderson, well known as the author of many useful publications, that the improvement of British wool was a matter of too much importance to be entrusted to a society which is obliged to devote its attention to such a variety of objects as the general improvement of the Highlands of Scotland. The latter of these gentlemen, therefore, in an Appendix to the Report of the Committee of the Highland Society...\nSociety of Scotland, for the year 1792, proposed the plan of a patriotic association for the improvement of British wool; and the former, who was convenor of the committee to whom the subject of Shetland wool had been referred, wrote circular letters, recommending the plan. The consequence of which was, that on the 31st of January 1791, several noblemen and gentlemen of the highest respectability met in Edinburgh, and constituted themselves into a Society for the Improvement of British Wool. Of this society Sir John Sinclair was elected president; after which, in an excellent speech, he pointed out to the members the objects of the institution, the means by which those objects could be attained, and the advantages which would result from their united labours. This address was afterwards printed by order of the society.\n\nThe particular breeds of sheep to which the society proposed to direct its attention, were sheep for the hilly parts of Scotland; sheep for the plains, or the Lowland breed; and sheep for the islands. They were to try experiments also with sheep from foreign countries, distinguished by any particular property.\n\nThe principal objects which the members had in view, during the first year of their association, were, 1. To collect specimens of the best breeds which Great Britain at that period afforded, in order to ascertain the degree of perfection to which sheep had already been brought in this kingdom. 2. To procure from every country, distinguished for the quality of its sheep and wool, specimens of the different breeds it possessed, in order to ascertain how far the original breed, or a mixed breed from it and the native sheep of the country, could thrive in Scotland. 3. To distribute as much as possible all these breeds, both foreign and domestic, over the whole kingdom, wherever proper persons could be found to take charge of them, in order to try experiments on a more extensive scale than the society itself could do; to spread information, and to excite a spirit for the improvement of sheep and wool in every part of the country.\n\nSir John Sinclair had previously collected a flock, consisting of sheep of the Spanish, Herefordshire, Southdown, Cheviot, Lomond hills, and Shetland breeds, and of a mixed breed from these different sheep. This flock amounted to 110 rams, ewes, and lambs. M. d'Aubenton, in consequence of a correspondence with Sir John Sinclair, sent over to the society ten rams and five ewes, of real Spanish breed, which had been originally entrusted to his care by the late king of France: these, after encountering a number of obstacles, and after being shipped and threatened to be slaughtered at the customhouse of Brighthelmstone for the use of the poor, arrived safe at Leith. Lord Sheffield, at the same time, sent to the society four rams and six ewes of the Southdown and Spanish breeds. Mr Bilton of Killall, in Shropshire, presented them with three Hereford rams, reckoned by many the best breed in England; the society at the same time ordered 150 ewes of the same breed, and two ewes of the Long Mountain breed, reckoned the best in Wales, to be sent along with them. They purchased 57 rams and 173 ewes of the Cheviot breed, reckoned the best in Scotland, for the hilly parts of the country. Lord Dacre sent them 20 ewes of an excellent breed, which existed at Mochrum in Galloway. The late earl of Oxford sent them in a present three rams of the Norfolk crossed by the Cape of Good Hope breed. Mr Isaac Grant junior of Leghorn, in conjunction with Mr Sibbald, merchant at Leith, presented them an Apulian ram and ewe; the ram arrived in safety, but the ewe unfortunately died on the passage. Mr Baron Seton of Preston, in Linlithgowshire, lent them a ram and two ewes of a Spanish breed, which had been for some time kept in Sweden unmixed with any other. They purchased 100 ewes of a small breed existing in the parish of Leuchars in Fife, much resembling the Shetland. The Right Honourable William Conyngham of Ireland sent them 11 Spanish rams, seven Spanish ewes, 15 three-fourth breed and 16 one-half breed Spanish and Irish ewes. Lord Sheffield sent them eight rams and 18 ewes; and his Majesty made them a present of two rams.\n\nThus, in the course of one year, the society acquired by donation or purchase about 800 sheep of different sorts and ages, and many of them from foreign countries: about 500 of these were distributed over different parts of Scotland, the greater number of which were sold to gentlemen anxious to promote the views of the society, and well qualified to make experiments on the different breeds which they had obtained. The greatest part of the remainder were taken by different gentlemen who kept them for the society, and according to their directions, without any expense.\n\nIt is impossible to produce an influence of so much having been accomplished by a society of private individuals in so short a time. Nor was this all; the same year Mr Andrew Kerr, a very intelligent sheep-farmer on the borders of England, was sent, at the expense of the society, to examine the state of sheep-farming along the east coast of Scotland and the interior parts of the Highlands. His tour was printed by order of the society, and contains the first intimation of the possibility of the Cheviot breed thriving in the north of Scotland.\n\nIn the year 1792, Messrs Redhead, Laing, and Marshall, were sent by the society, to make a survey of the state of sheep-farming through some of the principal counties of England; the result of which was also published by the society, and contains more information on the subject of the different breeds of England than any work hitherto published; and in 1794, Mr John Naifmyth was sent on a tour through the southern districts of Scotland, which completed the circuit of almost the whole kingdom.\n\nThus a few private individuals, unaided by the public purse, had boldness enough to undertake ascertaining the comparative value of the different kinds of sheep in their own country, and to introduce some of the most celebrated breeds of other countries, and succeeded in the spirited attempt. It is impossible in this place to state more minutely the various other transactions of the society; to enter into any detail of the premiums given by this respectable institution for the improvement of the celebrated Shetland breed; or to explain how, as if it were by magic, in a country where the manufacture of wool was little known, articles manufactured of that material were made, rivaling, and in some cases surpassing, the most celebrated fabrics of other countries. A war having unfortunately arisen, it became impossible to pay the same attention, or to carry on with the same success, novel enterprises; even old\nold establishments often fall a sacrifice amidst the horrors of war. The utmost that the British Wool Society could expect to do, was to preserve the institution in such a state, that when peace shall be happily restored it may revive with double energy and spirit.\n\nIt is a curious fact that the Romans, during their residence in Britain, established a manufactory of woollen cloth at Winchester, which was so extensive as to supply their army; and there is reason to believe that the trade which they introduced into Britain, was not neglected by the native inhabitants, for the first 920 years of the Christian era. The long Spanish wool was imported into this country so early as the 12th century, and we find that since the days of Edward III. British fleeces were admirably adapted to the kind of cloth which was in greatest request, though now they are generally unequal to the production of that which is sought after.\n\nWOOL-Combing, a well known operation, which, when performed by the hand, is laborious, tedious, and expensive. The expense of it through all England has been calculated at no less a sum than \u00a380,000; and to lessen this expense, the Rev. Edmund Cartwright of Doncaster in Yorkshire betook himself, some years ago, to carding wool by machinery. After repeated attempts and improvements, for which he took out three patents, he found that wool can be combed in perfection by machinery, of which he gives the following description.\n\nFig. 1. is the crank lather. A is a tube through which the material, being formed into a sliver, and slightly twisted, is drawn forward by the delivering rollers; B, a wheel fast upon the cross bar of the crank; C, a wheel, on the opposite end of whose axis is a pinion working in a wheel upon the axis of one of the delivering rollers.\n\nNote. When two or more slivers are required, the cans or baskets, in which they are contained, are placed upon a table under the lather (as represented at D), which, by having a slow motion, twists them together as they go up.\n\nFig. 2. is the circular clearing comb, for giving work in the head, carried in a frame by two cranks. Fig. 3. the comb-table, having the teeth pointing towards the centre, moved by cogs upon the rim, and carried round upon trucks like the head of a windmill. a, b, the drawing rollers. c, d, Callendar, or conducting rollers.\n\nNote. Underneath the table is another pair of rollers, for drawing out the backings.\n\nIn the above specification, we have omitted the frame in which the machine stands, the wheels, shafts, &c. Had these been introduced, the drawing would have been crowded and confused; besides, as matters of information, they would have been unnecessary, every mechanic, when he knows the principles of a machine, being competent to apply the movements to it.\n\nThe wool, if for particularly nice work, goes through three operations, otherwise two are sufficient: the first operation opens the wool, and makes it connect together into a rough sliver, but does not clear it. The clearing is performed by the second, and, if necessary, a third operation. A set of machinery, consisting of three machines, will require the attendance of an overseer and ten children, and will comb a pack, or 240 lb., in twelve hours. As neither fire nor oil is necessary for machine-combing, the saving of those articles, even the fire alone, will, in general, pay the wages of the overseer and children; so that the actual saving to the manufacturer is the whole of what the combing costs, by the old imperfect mode of hand-combing. Machine-combed wool is better, especially for machine-spinning, by at least 12 per cent. being all equally mixed, and the slivers uniform, and of any required length.","sp":433,"ep":435},{"h":"WOOLSTON","t":"Thomas, an English divine, was born at Northampton in 1669, and educated at Cambridge.

He afterwards wrote many pieces; but what made the most noise, were his six Discourses on the Miracles of Christ; which occasioned a great number of books and pamphlets upon the subject, and raised a prosecution against him. At his trial in Guildhall, before the lord chief-justice Raymond, he spoke several times himself; and urged, that \"he thought it very hard that he should be tried by a set of men who, though otherwise very learned and worthy persons, were no more judges of the subjects on which he wrote, than himself was a judge of the most crabbed points of the law.\" He was sentenced to a year's imprisonment, and to pay a fine of \u00a3100.

Its market is well supplied with provisions, corn, and cattle, and its quay is much frequented by ships. By a charter from James I. it is governed by a mayor, six aldermen, who are justices of the peace, and chosen out of 24 capital citizens; a sheriff, the city being a county of itself; a common council, consisting of 48 other citizens, out of which two chamberlains are yearly chosen; a recorder, town-clerk, two coroners, a sword-bearer, 13 constables, and four sergeants at mace.

Lat. 52. 10.\n\nWorcester, Edward Somerset, Marquis of, was a distinguished political character in the time of Charles I., by whom he was created earl of Glamorgan, while heir-apparent to the marquis of Worcester. This nobleman flourished chiefly in the reign of Charles I., and seems to have been a most zealous adherent to the cause of that unfortunate monarch, on whose account it is said that he and his father wasted an immense sum. Of this the king was so sensible, that he granted to the earl a most extraordinary patent, the chief powers of which were, to make him generalissimo of three armies, and admiral with nomination of his officers; to enable him to raise money by selling his majesty's woods, wardships, customs, and prerogatives; and to create by blank patents, to be filled up at Glamorgan's pleasure, from the rank of marquis to baronet. If any thing, says Lord Orford, could justify the delegation of such authority, besides his majesty having lost all authority, when he conferred it, it was the promise with which the king concluded of bestowing the princess Elizabeth on Glamorgan's son. This patent was given up by the marquis to the house of peers after the restoration. He died not long after that era, in 1667, after he had published what Lord Orford calls the following amazing piece of folly.\n\n\"A century of the names and scantlings of such inventions, as at present I can call to mind to have tried and perfected, which (my former notes being lost) I have, at the instance of a powerful friend, endeavoured now in the year 1655, to let these down in such a way as may sufficiently instruct me to put any of them in practice.\"\n\nSome of the inventions referred to in this work are the following. A ship-destroying engine, a coach-topping engine, a balance water-work, a bucket fountain, an ebbing and flowing cattle clock, a tinder-box pistol, a pocket ladder, a most admirable way to raise weights, a stupendous water-work. For the last contrivance the marquis procured an act of parliament in 1663, for the sole benefit arising from it, one-tenth of it being appropriated to Charles II. and his successors.\n\nIn a manuscript addition to a copy of the Century of Inventions, the stupendous or water-commanding engine is described as boundless for height or quantity, requiring no external, or even additional help or force to be set or continued in motion, but what intrinsically is afforded from its own operation, nor yet the twentieth part thereof, and the engine consisteth of the following particulars. 1. A perfect counterpoise for what quantitysoever of water. 2. A perfect countervail for what heightsoever it is to be brought unto. 3. A primum mobile, commanding both height and quantity, regulator-wife. 4. A vicegerent or countervail, supplying the place, and performing the full force of man, wind, beast, or mill. 5. A helm or stern, with bit and reins, wherewith any child may guide, order, and control the whole operation. 6. A particular magazine for water, according to the intended quantity or height of water. 7. A place for the original fountain, or even river to run into, and naturally of its own accord incorporate itself with the rising water, and at the very bottom of the same aqueduct, though never so big or high.\n\nVarious and very opposite opinions have been held with regard to the title of this nobleman to be considered as a mechanical genius. Lord Orford has pronounced his work an amazing piece of folly; and Mr Hume, speaking of his political conduct, says, \"that the king judged aright of this nobleman's character, appears from his Century of Arts, or Scantling of Inventions, which is a ridiculous compound of lies, chimeras, and impossibilities, and shows what might be expected from such a man.\" Hist. of England. It may be fairly presumed from the quotations now made, that neither Lord Orford nor Mr Hume was qualified to judge of the marquis's work, otherwise a more temperate or a more modified opinion would have been given. By others, the author of the inventions has been regarded as one of the greatest mechanical geniuses, and is to be considered as the inventor of the steam-engine, which he denominates a stupendous water-work. There seems to be no reason to suppose that any steam-engine was erected by the marquis himself; but it is said that Captain Savary, after reading the marquis's books, tried many experiments upon the power and force of steam, and at last fell upon a method of applying it to raise water; and having bought up and destroyed all the marquis's books that could be got, claimed the honour of the invention to himself, and obtained a patent for it.\nThe marquis of Worcester is sometimes confounded with John Tiptoft, earl of Worcester, a very accomplished literary character, who lived in the times of Henry VI. and Edward IV.

See the several articles, together with FORTIFICATION and PYROTECHNY.\n\nWORK-House, a place where indigent, vagrant, and idle people, are set to work, and supplied with food and clothing.\n\nWork-houses are of two kinds, or at least are employed for two different purposes. Some are used as prisons for vagrants or sturdy beggars, who are there confined and compelled to labour for the benefit of the society which maintains them; whilst others, sometimes called poor-house, are charitable asylums for such indigent persons as through age or infirmity are unable to support themselves by their own labour. The former kind of work-house, when under proper management, may be made to serve the best of purposes; of the latter we are acquainted with none which entirely commands our approbation.\n\nTo make confinement in a work-house operate to the correction of vagrants and disorderly persons (and if it produce not this effect it can hardly be considered as a beneficial institution), the prisoners should be shut up in separate cells, and compelled to labour for their own subsistence. A crew of thieves and vagabonds associating with each other is a hell upon earth, in which every individual is hardened in his crimes by the countenance and conversation of his companions; and wretches who, when at liberty, choose to beg or steal rather than to earn a comfortable livelihood by honest industry, will submit to any punishment which a humane overseer can inflict rather than work for the benefit of others. No punishment indeed will compel a vagrant to labour. He may assume the appearance of it, but he will make no progress; and the pretext of fickleness or weakness is ever at hand for an excuse. Hence it is that thieves and trumpets...\nstrumpets are too often dismissed from work-houses and bridewells ten times more the children of the devil than when they entered them.\n\nTo remedy these evils, we can think of no better method than to confine each prisoner in a cell by himself, and to furnish him daily with such an allowance of bread and water as may preserve him from immediate death; for the only compulsion to make such men work seriously is the fear of want, and the only way to reform them is to leave them to their own meditations on the consequences of their past conduct. There are surely very few persons, if any, whose aversion from labour would not be conquered by the pinching of hunger and the certain prospect of perishing by famine; and it is to be hoped that there are not many so totally divested of every latent principle of virtue as not to be brought by such solitude to a due sense of their former wickedness. Should one or two, however, be occasionally found to be very obdurate as to suffer themselves to perish rather than work, their deaths would prove a salutary beacon to others, and their blood would be on their own heads; for we have the express command of St Paul himself, that \"if any will not work, neither should he eat.\"\n\nNo doubt it would be proper that the meditations of vagabonds confined in a work-house should be directed by the private admonitions of a pious and intelligent clergyman; but it is not every clergyman who is qualified to discharge such a duty. If he be actuated by a zeal not according to knowledge, or if he have not with equal care studied human nature and the word of God, his admonitions will be more likely to provoke the profane ridicule of his auditor, and harden him in his wickedness, than to excite in his breast such sorrow for his sins as shall \"bring forth fruits meet for repentance.\" To render the instruction of thieves and vagrants of any use, it must be accurately adapted to the case of each individual; and however excellent it may be in itself, it will not be listened to unless offered at seasons of uncommon severity, which the instructor should therefore carefully observe.\n\nThat such wholesome severity as this would often reform the inhabitants of work-houses, appears extremely probable from the effects of a similar treatment of common prostitutes mentioned by Lord Kames in his Sketches of the History of Man: \"A number of those wretches were in Edinburgh confined in a house of correction, on a daily allowance of threepence, of which part was embezzled by the servants of the house. Pinching hunger did not reform their manners; for being absolutely idle, they encouraged each other in vice, waiting impatiently for the hour of deliverance. Mr Sterling the superintendent, with the consent of the magistrates, removed them to a clean house; and, instead of money, appointed for each a pound of oatmeal daily, with salt, water, and fire for cooking. Relieved now from distress, they longed for comfort. What would they not give for milk or ale? Work (says he) will procure you plenty. To some who offered to spin, he gave flax and wheels, engaging to pay them half the price of their yarn, retaining the other half for the materials furnished. The spinners earned about ninepence weekly; a comfortable addition to what they had before. The rest undertook to spin, one after another; and before the end of the first quarter they were all of them intent upon work. It was a branch of his plan to let free such as merited that favour; and some of them appeared to be so thoroughly reformed as to be in no danger of a relapse.\"\n\nWork-houses erected as charitable asylums appear to us, in every view that we can take of them, as institutions which can serve no good purpose. Economy is the great motive which inclines people to this mode of providing for the poor. There is comparatively but a very small number of mankind in any country so aged and infirm as not to be able to contribute, in some degree, to their subsistence by their own labour; and in such houses it is thought that proper work may be provided for them, so that the public shall have nothing to give in charity but what the poor are absolutely unable to procure for themselves. It is imagined likewise, that numbers collected at a common table, can be maintained at less expense than in separate houses; and feet soldiers are given for an example, who could not live on their pay if they did not meet together. But the cases are not parallel. \"Soldiers having the management of their pay, can club for a bit of meat; but as the inhabitants of a poor-house are maintained by the public, the same quantity of provisions must be allotted to each. The consequence is what might be expected: the bulk of them reserve part of their victuals for purchasing ale or spirits. It is vain to expect work from them: poor wretches void of shame will never work seriously, where the profit accrues to the public, not to themselves. Hunger is the only effectual means for compelling such persons to work.\"\n\nThe poor, therefore, should be supported in their own houses; and to support them properly, the first thing to be done is, to estimate what each can earn by his own labour; for as far only as that falls short of maintenance, is there room for charity. In repairing those evils which society did not or could not prevent, it ought to be careful not to counteract the wise purposes of nature, nor to do more than to give the poor a fair chance to work for themselves. The present distress must be relieved, the sick and the aged provided for; but the children must be instructed; and labour, not alms, offered to those who have some ability to work, however small that ability may be. They will be as industrious as possible, because they work for themselves; and a weekly sum of charity under their own management will turn to better account than in a poor-house under the direction of mercenaries. Not a penny of it will be laid out on fermented liquors, unless perhaps as a medicine in sickness. Nor does such low fair call for pity to those who can afford no better. Ale makes no part of the maintenance of those who, in many parts of Scotland, live by the sweat of their brows; and yet the person who should banish ale from a charity work-house, would be exclaimed against as hard-hearted, and even void of humanity.\n\nThat such a mode of supporting the poor in their own houses is practicable, will hardly admit of a dispute; for it has been actually put in practice in the city of Hamburg ever since the year 1788. At that period such revenues as had till then been expended in alms by the several church-wardens, and those of which the administration had been connected with the workhouse, were united under one administration with such sums as were collected from private benevolence. The city was divided into sixty districts, containing each an equal\nequal number of poor; and over these 180 overseers were appointed. Actual relief was the first object; but at the very moment that this provision was secured, measures were taken to prevent any man from receiving a shilling which he could have been able to earn for himself. By these methods, which our limits will not permit us to state, the overseers were able to make a calculation tolerably exact of what each pauper wanted for bare subsistence, in addition to the fruits of his own labour.\n\nA flax-yarn-spinning manufacture was established, in which the yarn is paid for, not by its weight, but by its measure. The clean flax is sold to the poor at a low price, and a certain measure of yarn again bought from them at 30 per cent. above the usual price; so that the overseers are sure that all the yarn spun by the poor will be brought into their office. Every pauper brings with him a book in which the quantity delivered is carefully noted down, which furnishes the overseers with a continual average of the state of industry among their poor.\n\nAs soon as this institution was established, the overseers went through their difficulties, and asked, in all such mansions as could be supposed to harbour want, if the inhabitants stood in need of support? The question to all such poor as wished for relief, and were able to spin, was, Whether they did earn by their work 1s. 6d. a-week? For experience had taught the inhabitants of Hamburgh, that many poor live upon that sum; and they knew enough of their poor to suppose, that 1s. 6d. avowed earning was equal to something more. If the answer was affirmative, the pauper stood not in need of weekly assistance. If it was negative, work was given him, which, by being paid 30 per cent. above its value, afforded him 1s. 6d. a-week easily, if he was even an indifferent hand. The far more frequent cases were partial inability by age, or weakness, or want of skill. For poor of the latter description a school was opened, and in three months time the buffaloes was easily learnt. During that time, the pauper got first 2s. a-week, and every week afterwards 2d. less, till in the twelfth week he got nothing at all but his earnings, and was dismissed, with a wheel and a pound of flax gratis.\n\nThe quantity of work which disabled poor were capable of doing in a week was easily and accurately ascertained by a week's trial in the spinning-school. The result was produced weekly before appointed members of the committee, and the sum which the poor could earn was noted down in their small books. The overseer was directed to pay them weekly what their earnings fell short of 1s. 6d. in every such week, when it appeared from their books that they had earned to the known extent of their abilities. From that moment applications became less frequent; and the committee had an infallible standard for distinguishing real want: for whenever the pauper, if in health (if not, he was peculiarly provided for), had not earned what he could, then he had either been lazy, or had found more lucrative work; in either case, he was not entitled to a relief for that week, whatever he might be for the following.\n\nThis mode of providing for the poor, which attracted the notice and obtained the eulogium of the minister and the British house of commons, has for six years been in Hamburgh attended with the happiest consequences. In the streets of that city a beggar is rarely to be seen, whilst those who stand in need of the charitable contributions of the rich, are much more comfortably, as well as at much less expense, maintained at home, with their children about them, than they could be in work-houses, under the management of mercenary overseers. For a fuller account of this judicious institution, we must refer the readers to Voght's Account of the Management of the Poor in Hamburgh, since the year 1788, in a Letter to some Friends of the Poor in Great Britain.","sp":437,"ep":439},{"h":"WORLD","t":"the assemblage of parts which compose the globe of the earth.

He published some pieces on subjects relating to his profession, several works in defence of Aristotle's philosophy, and several concerning the antiquities of Denmark and Norway; for which latter he is principally regarded, as they are very learned, and contain many curious particulars. He died in 1614.\n\nWORMWOOD. See ARTEMISIA, BOTANY Index.\n\nWORSHIP OF GOD (cultus Dei), amounts to the same with what we otherwise call religion. This worship consists in paying a due respect, veneration, and homage to the Deity, under a certain expectation of reward. And this internal respect, &c. is to be shown and testified by external acts; as prayers, sacrifices, thanksgivings, &c.\n\nThe Quietists, and some other mystic divines, set aside not only all use of external worship, but even the consideration of rewards and punishments. Yet even the heathens had a notion that God did not require us to serve him for nought: \"Dii quamobrem colendi sint (says Cicero), non intelligo, nullo nee accepto ab illis nec sacerato bono.\"\n\nThe school-divines divide worship into divers kinds, viz. latria, that rendered to God; and idolatria, that rendered to idols or images. To which the Romans add, dulia, that rendered to saints; and hyperdulia, that to the Virgin. Some theological writers have observed, that the Greek word, \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03ba\u03cd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, to worship, is not descriptive only of the honour which is appropriated to God, but is indifferently used to signify the honour and respect which are paid to superiors of all kinds in heaven or on earth. Accordingly, they have distinguished between civil and religious worship.\n\nThat it is the duty of man to worship his Maker, has been sufficiently proved under other articles (see PRAYER; and THEOLOGY, No 40\u201445). It is not indeed easy to be conceived how any one who has tolerably just notions of the attributes and providence of God, can possibly neglect the duty of private worship; and though we have admitted in the last of the two articles referred to, that public worship does not seem to be enjoined in that system which is called the religion of nature, yet it is most expressly commanded by the religion of Christ, and will be regularly performed by every one who reflects on its great utility.\n\nAs the illiterate vulgar cannot form to themselves correct notions of the divine providence and attributes, it is obvious, that without the institution of public worship, they would never think of worshipping God at all, unless perhaps occasionally, when under the pressure of some severe calamity; but occasional worship, the offspring of compulsion, could have little of the reigned spirit of true devotion. Ignorant, however, as the lowest of the vulgar are, and necessarily must be, it cannot be denied, that in most Christian countries, perhaps in all, they are more accurately acquainted with the first principles of religion, and the laws of morality, than even the leaders of barbarous nations. This superiority is doubtless owing in some measure to their access to the Sacred Scriptures, but much more, we are persuaded, to the instruction which they receive in the assemblies which they frequent for public worship. If this be admitted, public worship may be easily proved to be the duty of every individual of the community: For were those, who may be supposed to stand in no need either of the contagion of society to kindle their own devotion, or of the preaching of a clergyman to instruct them in the doctrines and precepts of the gospel, to \"forbear, on these accounts, the assembling themselves together, as the manner of some is,\" religious assemblies and public worship would very quickly fall into universal disuse. Man is an animal prone to imitation; and every order in society is ambitious of treading in the footsteps of the order immediately above it. Were the wife and the good, therefore, permitted to absent themselves from the assemblies instituted for the public worship of the Creator and Redeemer of the world, others would quickly follow their example; impelled to it not only by this universal propensity, but by the additional motive of wishing to appear both to the world and to themselves as wife and as good as their privileged neighbours. The consequence is obvious: one man would stay from church with the serious intention perhaps of employing the Lord's day in private devotion and religious study; another, following his example, would absent himself upon the same pretence, but would in reality waste the day in dozing indolence or in secret sensuality. For these and other reasons which might be easily assigned, no sincere Christian will think himself at liberty to dispute a practice enjoined by the inspired preachers of his religion, coeval with the institution, and retained by every sect into which it has since been unhappily divided.\n\nAs Christian worship consists of prayers and praises, it has been a matter of some debate whether it is most properly performed by preconcerted forms or liturgies, or by extemporaneous addresses to the Almighty. Both these modes have their advantages and disadvantages; and by the sacred writers neither of them is preferred in opposition to the other.\n\nThe advantages of a liturgy are, that it prevents absurd, extravagant, or impious addresses to God, which the folly or enthusiasm of individuals must always be in danger of producing; it gives the congregation an opportunity of joining in the prayers which are put up for them, which they cannot possibly do in a series of extemporaneous petitions, since before they can attend to\nWorship, any one of these and make it their own, their attention is necessarily called away to that which succeeds it; and it relieves the clergyman from the labour of composition, which seems incompatible with that fervour which constitutes the spirit of devotion.\n\nThe disadvantages of a fixed liturgy, which are the recommendations of extemporary prayer, are principally two. The forms composed in one age must, by the unavoidable change of language, circumstances, and opinions, become in some degree unfit for another; and the perpetual repetition of the same form of words is very apt to produce inattentive laxitude in the congregation. Would the clergy of the church of England take that liberty which is allowed them in the bidding prayer before sermon, perhaps the service of that church would unite in itself all the advantages both of liturgical and extemporary worship. We have only to add on this subject, that public prayers, whether precomposed or not, ought to be compendious; that they ought to express just conceptions of the Divine attributes; recite such wants as the congregation are likely to feel, and no other; that they ought to contain as few controverted propositions as possible; and that, if it can be done without offence, the pompous style of the state should be laid aside in our prayers for the king and all that are in authority; because in every act which carries the mind to God, human greatness must be annihilated.","sp":440,"ep":441},{"h":"WORT","t":"the infusion of malt, of which beer is made.

But as these instruments, from the very nature of the material of which they are constructed, are liable to considerable change, the results which they afford cannot always be depended on. With the view of obviating these inconveniences, the patent areometrical beads have been invented by Mrs Lovi of Edinburgh. We have already noticed these beads, on account of their accuracy, simplicity, and facility of application for ascertaining the specific gravity, or the real strength and value, of spirituous liquors. See vol. xix. p. 599.; and we now recommend them with greater confidence, from having had opportunities of knowing that they are capable of a more extended application, as in the manufacture of acids, and salts of different kinds; to ascertain the strength of acids, or that of saline solutions in bleaching; to determine the strength of liquids employed in the different processes of calico printing and dyeing, and not only for the purpose of examining the strength of the acids employed, but also particularly to ascertain the density or specific gravity of the colouring matters which are used in these arts, so that the same degree of shade required may be always obtained. It has been suggested, that these beads might be conveniently employed in determining the strength of mineral waters, which, it is well known, vary considerably at different seasons of the year.\n\nAs the patent beads are constructed on the same principle from 800, the specific gravity of alcohol, to 2000, which is double the specific gravity of water; and as they are divided into different series, each of which includes a range of specific gravities applicable to the particular fluids, the density or strength of which is required, we have no hesitation in asserting that they will be found extremely convenient and useful to all manufacturers and dealers, who wish to ascertain with accuracy the real strength and value of liquids.\n\nIt has been objected to the use of these beads, that they require a longer time than other instruments in using them. The same objection has been made to the introduction of other new instruments, the application of which frequent use has afterwards rendered familiar and easy. We have had opportunities of knowing that this objection is completely obviated, by those who have been accustomed to use the beads. They find that they can determine the specific gravity of a liquid by means of the beads with the same facility, and in as short a time, as with any other instrument.","sp":441,"ep":441},{"h":"WOTTON","t":"Sir Henry, an eminent writer, was the son of Thomas Wotton, Esq. and was born in 1568.

After this, leaving the university, he travelled into France, Germany, and Italy; and having spent about nine years abroad, he returned to England, and became secretary to Robert earl of Essex, with whom he continued till that earl was apprehended for high-treason. He then retired to Florence, where he became known to the grand duke of Tuscany, who sent him privately with letters to James VI. king of Scotland, under the name of Octavio Baldi, to inform that king of a design against his life. Some months after he went back to Florence; but King James coming to the possession of the crown of England, Mr Wotton returned home, was knighted by his majesty, and sent ambassador to the republic of Venice; and afterwards was employed in many other embassies to that and other courts; but the only reward he obtained for these services was his having the provostship of Eton conferred upon him about the year 1623, which he kept till his death, which happened in 1639. After his decease some of his manuscripts and printed tracts were published together in a volume, intitled, Reliquiae Wottonianae.\n\nWotton, Dr William, a learned divine and writer, was the son of Mr Henry Wotton, B.D. rector of Wrentham, in Suffolk, where he was born in 1666. He was educated by his father, a gentleman well skilled in the learned languages; under whom he made such amazing proficiency, that at five years of age it is said he could render several chapters in the gospels out of Latin and Greek, and many psalms in Hebrew, into his mother tongue. When he was very young, he remembered the whole of almost every discourse he had heard, and often surprised a preacher by repeating his sermon to him. He was admitted into Catharine-hall in Cambridge some months before he was ten years old; when the progress he made in learning in that university engaged\ngaged Dr Duport, then master of Magdalen college, and dean of Peterborough, to write an elegant copy of Latin verses in his praise. In 1670 he took the degree of bachelor of arts when he was but twelve years and five months old; and the winter following he was invited to London by Dr Gilbert Burnet, then preacher at the Rolls, who introduced him to most of the learned men in that city, and particularly to Dr William Lloyd, bishop of St Asaph; to whom he recommended himself by repeating to him one of his sermons, as Dr Burnet had engaged he should. In 1691 he commenced bachelor of divinity. The same year Bishop Lloyd gave him the sinecure of Llandrillo, in Denbighshire. He was afterwards made chaplain to the earl of Nottingham, then secretary of state, who presented him to the rectory of Middleton Keynes, in Bucks, and to whom he dedicated his Reflections upon Ancient and Modern Learning. In 1705, Bishop Burnet gave him a prebend in the church of Salisbury; and in 1707, Archbishop Tenison presented him with the degree of doctor of divinity: but in 1714, the difficulties he laboured under with respect to his private fortune, obliged him to retire into South Wales, where he was treated with great kindness and humanity by the gentlemen of that country; and wrote there the \"Memoirs of the Cathedral Churches of St David's and Landaff;\" and his \"Miscellaneous Discourses relating to the Traditions and Usages of the Scribes and Pharisees,\" which were afterwards printed.

This knowledge can only be had from anatomy, by which the surgeon will be able to determine what parts are injured; and, from the offices which these parts are calculated to perform, whether the human frame can subsist under such injuries. It is not, however, easy for the most expert anatomist always to prognosticate the event with certainty; but this rule he ought always to lay down to himself, to draw the most favourable prognosis the case will bear, or even more than the rules of his art will allow. This is particularly incumbent on him in sea-engagements, where the sentence of death is executed as soon as pronounced, and the miserable patient is thrown alive into the sea, upon the surgeon's declaring his wound to be mortal. There are, besides, many instances on record, where wounds have healed, which the most skilful surgeons have deemed mortal. The following wounds may be reckoned mortal.\n\n1. Those which penetrate the cavities of the heart, and all those wounds of the viscera where the large blood-vessels are opened; because their situation will not admit of proper applications to restrain the flux of Wounds' blood.\n\n2. Those which entirely cut off the passage of the nervous influence through the body. Such are wounds of the brain, cerebellum, medulla oblongata, and spinal marrow. Wounds likewise of the small blood-vessels within the brain are attended with great danger, from the effused fluids pressing upon the brain. Nor is there less danger where the nerves which tend to the heart are wounded, or entirely divided; for, after this, it is impossible for the heart to continue its motion.\n\n3. All wounds which entirely deprive the animal of the faculty of breathing.\n\n4. Those wounds which interrupt the course of the chyle to the heart; such are wounds of the receptacle of the chyle, thoracic duct, and larger lacteals, &c.\n\n5. There are other wounds which prove fatal if neglected and left to nature: such are wounds of the larger external blood-vessels, which might be remedied by ligature. Wounds of such parts generally prove fatal; and though a few instances may have occurred where people have recovered after them, yet they are always to be considered as extremely dangerous. Portions of the brain have been destroyed, and wounds have been made into it, and the patients have lived. It is possible, too, that the thoracic duct might be wounded and the patient live; Mr A. Cooper having shown, in a very ingenious paper in the Medical Records and Researches, that it may become obstructed, and the chyle conveyed into the system by anastomosing lymphatics.\n\nIn examining wounds, the next consideration is, whether the parts injured are such as may be supposed to induce dangerous symptoms, either immediately or at some period during the course of the cure. In order to proceed with any degree of certainty, it is necessary to be well acquainted with those symptoms which attend injuries of the different parts of the body. If the skin and part of the cellular substance are only divided, the first effects are an effusion of blood; the lips of the wound retract, become tumefied, red and inflamed, leaving a gap of considerable wideness according to the length and deepness of the wound. If a very considerable portion of skin and cellular substance is divided, a slight fever seizes the patient; the effusion of blood in the mean time stops, and the wound is partly filled up, with a cake of coagulated blood. Below this cake, the small vessels pour forth a clear liquor, which in a short time is converted into pus (see the articles Pus and Mucus). Below this pus granulations of new flesh arise, the cake of coagulated blood looses, a new skin covers the place where the wound was, and the whole is healed up; and there only remains a mark, called a cicatrix or scar, showing where the injury had been received.\n\nAll wounds are accompanied with a considerable degree of pain, especially when the inflammation comes on, though the division reaches no farther than the skin and cellular substance. If the muscular fibres are divided, the pain is much greater, because the found part of the muscle is stretched by the contraction of the divided part and the action of the antagonist muscle, which it is now less fitted to bear. The wound also gaps much more than where the cellular substance is alone.\nWounds, alone divided, inasmuch that, if left to itself, the skin will cover the muscular fibres, without any intervention of cellular substance; and not only a very unsightly cicatrix remains, but the use of the muscle is in some measure lost.\u2014If the muscle happens to be totally divided, its fibres retract to a very considerable distance; and unless proper methods be taken to bring them into contact, the use of it is ever afterwards lost.\n\nIf by a wound any considerable artery happens to be divided, the blood flows out with great velocity, and by starts; the patient soon becomes faint with loss of blood; nor does the hemorrhage stop until he faints away altogether; and if as much vis viva still remains as is sufficient to renew the operations of life, he recovers after some time, and the wound heals up as usual.\n\nThe part of the artery which is below the wound in the meantime becomes useless, so that all the inferior part of the limb would be deprived of blood, were it not that the small branches sent off from the artery above the wounded place become enlarged, and capable of carrying on the circulation. Nature, also, after a wonderful manner, often produces new vessels from the superior extremity of the divided artery, by which the circulation is carried on as formerly. The consequences of such a profuse hemorrhage may be, however, very dangerous to the patient, by inducing extreme debility, or an universal dropy. This great hemorrhage happens especially where the artery is partially divided; because then the vessel cannot contract in such a manner as to close the orifice: however, if the wound is but small, the blood gets into the cellular substance, swelling up the member to an extreme degree, forming what is called a diffused aneurysm. Thus the hemorrhage soon flows externally, but great mischief is apt to flow from the confinement of the extravasated blood, from bringing on exterior suppuration among the muscles and bones; and thus not only the use of the limb is entirely lost, but the patient is brought into great danger of his life.\n\nWounds of the ligaments, nerves, and tendons, are likewise attended with bad consequences. When a nerve is entirely divided, the pain is but trifling, though the consequences are often dangerous. If the nerve is large, all the parts to which it is distributed below the wound immediately lose the power of motion and sensation. This, however, takes place only when all or the greatest part of the nerves belonging to a particular part are divided. If the spinal marrow, for instance, be divided near the head, the parts below soon lose their sensation irrecoverably; or if the bundle of nerves passing out of the axilla be divided or tied, fenation in the greatest part of the arm below will be lost. But though a nerve should be divided, and a temporary palsy be produced, it may reunite, and perform its former functions. If a nerve be wounded only, instead of being divided, the worst symptoms frequently ensue.\n\nWounds which penetrate the cavities of the thorax are always exceedingly dangerous, because there is a fear of possibility of all the viscera escaping unhurt. A wound is known to have penetrated the cavity of the thorax principally by the discharge of air from it at each inspiration, by an extreme difficulty of breathing, and by coughing up blood. Such wounds, however, are not always mortal; the lungs have frequently been wounded, and yet the patient has recovered.\u2014Wounds of the diaphragm are almost always mortal, either by inducing fatal convulsions immediately, or by the ascent of the stomach, which the pressure of the abdominal muscles forces up through the wound into the cavity of the thorax; of this Van Swieten gives several instances.\u2014Even though the wound do not penetrate into the cavity of the thorax, the very worst symptoms may follow. For if the wound descends deeply among the external muscles, and its orifice lies higher, the extravasated blood will be therein collected, stagnate, and form various sinuses; which after having eroded the pleura, may at length pass into the cavity of the thorax. The matter having once found a vent into this cavity, will be continually augmenting from the discharge of the sinus ulcer, and the lungs will at last suffer by the surrounding matter. If, in cases of wounds in the thorax, the ribs or sternum happen to become carious, the cure will be extremely tedious and difficult. Galen relates the case of a lad who received a blow upon his sternum in the field of exercise: it was first neglected, and afterwards badly healed; but, four months afterwards, matter appeared at the place which had received the blow. A physician made an incision into the part, and it was soon after cicatrized: but in a short time a new collection made its appearance, and upon a second incision the wound refused to heal. Galen found the sternum carious; and having cut off the diseased part, the pericardium itself was observed to be corroded, so that the heart could be seen quite naked; notwithstanding which, the wound was cured in no very long time.\n\nThere is sometimes difficulty in determining whether the wound has really penetrated into the thorax or into the abdomen; for the former defends much farther towards the sides than at the middle. But as the lungs are almost always wounded when the cavity of the thorax is penetrated, the symptoms arising from thence can scarcely be mistaken.\u2014Another symptom which frequently, though not always, attends wounds of the thorax, is an emphysema. This is occasioned by the air escaping from the wounded lungs, and infusing itself into the cellular substance; which being pervious to it over the whole body, the tumor passes from one part to another, till at last every part is inflated to a surprising degree. An instance is given in the Memoirs of the Royal Academy, of a tumour of this kind, which on the thorax was eleven inches thick, on the abdomen nine, on the neck six, and on the rest of the body four; the eyes were in a great measure thrust out of their orbits by the inflation of the cellular substance; and the patient died the fifth day. This was occasioned by a stab with a sword.\n\nWounds of the abdomen are not less dangerous than those of the thorax, on account of the importance of the organs and its viscera which it contains. When the wound does not penetrate the cavity, there is some danger of a hernia being formed by the protrusion of the peritoneum through the weakened integuments, and the danger is greater the larger the wound is. Those wounds which run obliquely between the interstices of the muscles often produce sinus ulcers of a bad kind. For as there is a large quantity of fat interposed everywhere between the muscles of the abdomen, if a wound happens to run between them, the matter there collected, not meeting with free egress through the mouth of the wound, often makes its way in a surprising manner through the cellu-\nWounds, lar substance, and forms deep sinuosities between the muscles; in which case the cure is always difficult, and sometimes impossible.\n\nIf a large wound penetrate the cavity of the abdomen, some of the viscera will certainly be protruded through it; or if the wound is but small, and closed up with fat so that none of the intestines can be protruded, we may know that the cavity of the abdomen is pierced, and probably some of the viscera wounded, by the acute pain and fever, paleness, anxiety, faintings, hiccup, cold sweats, and weakened pulse, all of which accompany injuries of the internal parts. The mischief which attend wounds of this kind proceed not only from the injury done to the viscera themselves, but from the extravasation of blood and the discharge of the contents of the intestines into the cavity of the abdomen; which, being of a very putrefactive nature, soon bring on the most violent disorders. Hence wounds of the abdominal viscera are very often mortal. This, however, is not always the case, for the small intestines have been totally divided, and yet the patient has recovered. Wounds both of the small and large intestines have healed spontaneously, even when they were of such magnitude that the contents of the intestine were freely discharged through the wound into the abdomen, and after part of the intestine itself has been protruded through the wound of the integuments.\n\nWhen the mesentery is injured, the danger is extreme, on account of its numerous vessels and nerves. Wounds of the liver, spleen, and pancreas, are also exceedingly dangerous, although there are some instances of the spleen being cut out of living animals without any considerable injury.\n\nFrom the preceding account of the symptoms attending wounds in the different parts of the body, the surgeon may be enabled to judge in some measure of the event; though it must always be remembered, that wounds, even those which seem at first to be of the slightest nature, have, contrary to all expectation, proved mortal, chiefly by inducing convulsions, or a locked jaw; so that no certain prognostic can be drawn on sight of recent wounds. We shall now, however, proceed to consider their treatment.\n\nFor the cure of wounds, it has been already observed, that the ancients imagined balms, the juice of herbs, &c., to be specifics. In after-ages, and in countries where balms are not easily to be procured, salves were substituted in their place; and even at this day there are many who reckon a salve or ointment essentially necessary for healing the slightest cut. It is certain, however, that the cure of wounds cannot be effected, nay, not even forwarded in the least, by ointments, unless in particular cases. That power which the human frame has of repairing the injuries done to itself, which by physicians is called vis medicatrix nature, is the sole agent in curing external injuries; and without this the most celebrated balms would prove ineffectual. When a wound has been made with a sharp instrument, and is not extensive, if it be immediately cleaned and all the extravasated blood sucked (A) out or washed away, it will almost always heal by adhesion. When a wound does not heal by this process, there are three stages to be observed in its cure; the first, called suppuration, which takes place when the ends of the wounded vessels contract themselves, and pour out the liquor which is converted into pus. As soon as this appears, the second, or granulating stage, in which the flesh begins to grow up, takes place; and as this proceeds, the edges of the wound acquire a fine bluish or pearl colour, which is that of the new skin beginning to cover the wound as far as the granulations have filled it up. This process continues, and the skin advances from all sides towards the centre, which is called the cicatrizing of the wound. For the promoting of each of these processes, several ointments were formerly much in vogue. But it is now found, that no ointment whatever is capable of promoting them; and that it is only necessary to keep the wound clean, and to prevent the air from having access to it. This, indeed, nature takes care to do, by covering the wound with a cake of coagulated blood; but if a wound of any considerable magnitude should be left entirely to nature, the pus would form below the crust of coagulated blood in such quantity, that it would most probably corrupt, and the wound degenerate into a corroding ulcer. It is necessary, therefore, to cleanse the wound frequently; for this purpose it will be proper to apply a little ointment spread on soft scraped lint. And, in a healthy body, the wound will heal without further trouble. As to the ointment employed, it is almost indifferent what it be, provided it has no acid or stimulating ingredient in its composition; hogs lard or the simple ointment of the Pharmacopeia will answer perfectly.\n\nBut though, in general, wounds thus easily admit of a cure, there are several circumstances which require a different treatment, even in simple divisions of the fleshy parts, when neither the membranous nor tendinous parts are injured. These are, 1. Where the wound is large, and gapes very much, so that, if allowed to heal in the natural way, the patient might be greatly disfigured by the scar. It is proper to bring the lips of the wound near to each other, and to join them either by adhesive plaster or by sutures, according as the wound is superficial, or deep. 2. When foreign bodies are lodged in the wound, as when a cut is given by glass, &c., it is necessary to extract them, before the wound is dressed; for it will never heal until they are discharged. When these bodies are situated in such a manner as not to be capable of being extracted without lacerating the adjacent parts, which would occasion violent pain and other bad symptoms, it is necessary to enlarge the wound, so that these offending bodies may be easily removed. This treatment, however, is chiefly necessary in gunshot wounds, of which we shall afterwards speak. 3. When the wound is made in such a manner that it runs for some length below the skin, and the bottom is much lower than the orifice, the matter collected from all parts of the wound will be lodged in the bottom of it, where, corrupting by the heat, it will degenerate into a fistulous ulcer. To prevent this, we must\n\n(A) See an account of the method of sucking wounds, in Mr John Bell's Discourses on Wounds, Part i. discourse v. p. 215.\nWounds must use compositives, applied so that the bottom of the wound may suffer a more considerable pressure than the upper part of it. Thus the matter formed at the bottom will be gradually forced upwards, and that formed at the upper part will be incapable of descending by its weight; the divided parts, in the mean time, easily uniting when brought close together. Indeed, the power which nature has of uniting different parts of the human body is very surprising; for, according to authors of credit, even if a piece of flesh be totally cut out, and applied in a short time afterwards to the place from whence it was cut, it will unite. That a part cut out of a living body does not entirely lose its vital power for some time, is evident from the modern practice of transplanting teeth; and from an experiment of Mr. John Hunter's, where he put the tarsus of a cock into the belly of a living hen, and the tarsus adhered to the liver, and became connected to it by means of blood-vessels*. We have therefore the greatest reason to hope, that the divided parts of the human body, when closely applied to each other, will cohere without leaving any sinus or cavity between them. However, if this method should fail, and matter be collected in the depending part of the wound, it will be necessary to make an opening in that part in order to let it out; after which the wound may be cured in the common way.\n\n4. During the course of the cure, it sometimes happens that the wound, instead of filling up with granulations of a florid colour, throbs into a glairy-like substance which rises above the level of the surrounding skin, while, at the same time, instead of laudable pus, a thin ill-coloured and fetid ichor is discharged. In this case the lips of the wound lose their beautiful pearl colour, and become callous and white, nor does the cicatrizing of the wound at all advance. When this happens in a healthy patient, it generally proceeds from some improper management, especially the making use of too many emollient and relaxing medicines, an immoderate use of balms and ointments. Frequently nothing more is requisite for taking down this fungus than dressing with dry lint; at other times dejective powders, such as calamine, tutty, calcined alum, &c., will be necessary; and sometimes red precipitate mercury must be used. This last, however, is apt to give great pain, if sprinkled in its dry state upon the wound; it is therefore most proper to grind it with some yellow balsam ointment, which makes a much more gentle, though at the same time an efficacious elixir.\n\nHitherto we have considered the wounded patient as otherwise in a state of perfect health; but it must be observed, that a large wound is capable of disordering the system to a great degree. If the patient is strong and vigorous, and the pain and inflammation of the wound great, considerable degree of fever may arise, which it will be necessary to check by bleeding, low diet, and other parts of the antiphlogistic regimen, at the same time the inflamed lips of the wound and parts adjacent are to be treated with emollient fomentations or cataplasm till the pain and swelling abate. On the other hand, it may happen, when the patient is of a weak and lax habit, that the vitreous may not be sufficient to excite such an inflammation in the wound as is absolutely necessary for its cure. In this case, the edges of the wound look pale and soft; the wound itself ichorous wounds, and bloody, without any signs of granulations; or if any granulations shoot up, they are of the fungous glairy kind above mentioned. To such wounds all external applications are vain; it is necessary to strengthen the patient by proper internal remedies, among which the bark has a principal place, until the wound begins to alter its appearance. In such persons, too, there is some danger of a hectic fever by the absorption of matter; and this will take place during the course of the cure, even when the appearances have been at first as favourable as could be wished. This happens generally when the wound is large, and a great quantity of matter formed; for by this discharge the patient is weakened; so that the pus is no sooner formed, than it is re-conveyed into the body by the absorbent vessels, and immediately affects the patient with feverish heat. When this takes place, the best remedy is to exhibit the bark copiously, at the same time to support the patient by proper cordials and nourishing diet. Indeed, in general, it will be found, that, in the case of wounds of any considerable magnitude, a more full and nourishing regimen is required than the patient, even in health, has been accustomed to; for the discharge of pus alone, where the quantity is considerable, proves very debilitating. And it is constantly found, that the cure of such cases goes on much more easily when the patient is kept in his usual habit of body, than when his system is much emaciated by a very low allowance; and, for the same reason, purgatives, taken more freely than what is necessary to keep the bowels open, and whatever else tends to weaken the constitution, are improper in the cure of wounds.\n\nHaemorrhages very frequently happen in wounds, either from a division of a large artery, or of a number of small ones. In this case, the first step to be taken by the surgeon is to effect a temporary stoppage of the blood by means of compression, and he is then to tie up all the larger vessels according to the methods usually directed.\n\nWhen the principal arteries of a wound have been tied, and a little blood continues to be discharged, which appears to come from sundry small vessels only, an experienced surgeon is induced to think, that the compression of the bandages will in all probability effect a total stoppage of the haemorrhagy. In a general oozing, from the whole surface of a face, and when no particular vessel can be distinguished, there is a necessity for trifling to the bandage or compression; but whenever an artery can be discovered, of whatever size it may be, it ought to be secured by a ligature. But it frequently happens, that considerable quantities of blood are discharged, not from any particular vessel, but from all the small arteries over the surface of the wound; and in wounds of great extent, particularly after the extirpation of cancerous growths, and in other operations where extensive faces are left, this species of haemorrhagy often proves very troublesome by being exceedingly difficult to suppress.\n\nIn constitutions perfectly healthy, on the occurrence of wounds even of the most extensive nature, as soon as the larger arteries are secured, all the small vessels which have been divided are diminished, not only in their diameters, but also in their length; in consequence of which, they recede considerably within the surface of the\nthe surrounding parts. This cause of itself would probably, in the greatest number of instances, prove sufficient for restraining all loss of blood from the smaller arteries. Another very powerful agent however is provided by nature for producing the same effect. From the extremities of the divided vessels which at first discharged red blood, there now, in their contracted state, ooze out a more thin, though viscid fluid, containing a great proportion of the coagulable parts of the blood; and this being equally distributed over the surface of the wound, by its agglutinating powers has a very considerable influence in restraining all such hemorrhages.\n\nWhen a tedious oozing occurs in a patient young and vigorous, and where the tone of the muscular fibres is evidently great, the most effectual means of putting a stop to the discharge is to relax the vascular system, either by opening a vein in some other part, or, what gives still more immediate relief, by tying the ligature on one of the principal arteries of the part, so as to allow it to bleed freely: those violent spasmodic twitchings too, so frequent after operations on any of the extremities, when they do not depend on a nerve being included in the ligature with the artery, are in this manner more effectually relieved than by any other means.\n\nBy the same means the patient, from being in a febrile heat and much confused, soon becomes very tranquil: the violent pulsation of the heart and larger arteries abates, and the blood not being propelled with such impetuosity into the smaller vessels of the part, they are left at more liberty to retract.\n\nThe patient ought to be kept exceedingly cool; wine and other cordials should be rigidly avoided; cold water, acidulated either with the mineral or vegetable acids, ought to be the only drink; motion of every kind, particularly of the part affected, should be guarded against; and the lip of the wound being drawn together by adhesive plaster, and gently covered with soft charpie, it ought to be tied up with a bandage so applied as to produce a moderate degree of pressure on the extremities of the divided parts.\n\nAs soon as a sufficient quantity of blood has been discharged, the wound dressed, and the patient laid to rest, a dose of opium proportioned to the violence of the symptoms ought to be immediately exhibited. It ought to be remarked, however, that in all such circumstances, much larger doses of this medicine are necessary than in ordinary cases requiring the use of opiates. Small doses, instead of answering any good purpose, seem frequently rather to aggravate the various symptoms; so that whenever they are had recourse to in such cases, they ought always to be given in quantities sufficient for the intended effect.\n\nBut hemorrhages of this nature happen much more frequently in relaxed enfeebled habits, where the solids have lost part of their natural firmness, and the fluids have acquired a morbid tenacity. In this case a moderate use of generous wine ought to be immediately prescribed; for nothing tends so much, in such circumstances, to restrain hemorrhages, as a well directed use of proper cordials. By tending to invigorate and brace the solids, they enable the arterial system to give a due resistance to the contained fluids; and have also a considerable influence in restoring to the fluids that viscidity of texture, of which in all such instances we suppose them to be deprived.\n\nA nourishing diet also becomes proper; the patient ought to be kept cool; and the mineral acids, from their known utility in every species of hemorrhagy, ought also to be prescribed. Rest of body is here also proper; and opiates, when indicated either by pain or spasmodic affections of the muscles, ought never to be omitted.\n\nTogether with these remedies adapted to the general system, particular dressings, appropriated to the state of the parts to which they are to be applied, have been found very beneficial. In healthy constitutions, soon after the discharge of blood is over, the parts are covered with a viscid coagulable effusion from the mouths of the now retracted arteries; but in constitutions of an opposite nature, where the solids are much relaxed, the blood in general is found in such an attenuated state as to afford no secretion of this nature.\n\nTo supply as much as possible the deficiency of this natural balsam, different artificial applications have been invented. Dusting the part with starch or wheat-flour has sometimes been found of use, and gum arabic in fine powder has been known to answer when these failed.\n\nApplications of this kind, indeed, have been used with success in all such hemorrhages, with whatever habit of body they happen to be connected; but they have always proved more particularly serviceable in relaxed constitutions, attended with an attenuated state of the blood and an enfeebled muscular system. Alcohol, or any other ardent spirits, impregnated with as great a quantity as they can dissolve of myrrh, or any other of the heating viscid gums, may be here used with freedom, though in constitutions of an opposite nature they ought never to be employed. The balsamum traumaticum of the shops, a remedy of this nature, has long been famous for its influence in such cases: but that indiscriminate use of this and similar applications which has long prevailed with some practitioners, has undoubtedly done much harm; for as they are all possessed of very stimulating powers, they of course tend to aggravate every symptom in wounds connected with a tensile state of fibres, or much pain, especially when spasmodic muscular affections prevail.\n\nBy a due perseverance in one or other of the plans here pointed out, it will seldom happen that hemorrhages are not at last put a stop to: but when the contrary does occur, when notwithstanding the use of the remedies recommended, a discharge of blood still continues; in addition to the means already advised, an equal moderate pressure ought to be applied over the whole surface of the fore, to be continued as long as the necessity of the case seems to indicate.\n\nIn finishing the dressings of such wounds, after the adhesive plaster and compresses have been applied, a bandage properly adapted to the part ought to be employed, and in such a manner as to produce as equal a degree of pressure over the surface of the wound as possible. But it now and then happens that no bandage can be applied so as to produce the desired effect; and in such cases the hand of an assistant is the only resource; which being firmly pressed over the dressings, will commonly succeed when no other means is found to have much influence.\nWounds of the nerves, tendons, and ligaments, are attended with much more violent symptoms than those where even considerable arteries are divided, and they frequently resist every method of cure proposed by the most skilful practitioners. In the simple process of blood-letting, it frequently happens that the tendinous expansion called the aponeurosis of the biceps muscle is wounded, or even the tendon of that muscle itself is punctured, by the point of the lancet; or sometimes a nerve which happens to lie in the neighbourhood is partially divided. Any one of these wounds, though they are the smallest we can well suppose to be given, are frequently very dangerous and difficult of cure. It sometimes immediately happens on the introduction of the lancet, that the patient complains of a most exquisite degree of pain; and when this occurs, we may rely assuredly that either a tendon or a nerve has been wounded. On some occasions, by proper management, such as evacuating a considerable quantity of blood at the orifice newly made, by keeping the part at perfect rest, and preserving the patient in as cool a state as possible, the pain at first complained of will gradually abate, and at last go off entirely without any bad consequence. At other times, however, this pain which occurs instantaneously on the introduction of the lancet, instead of abating, begins soon to increase; a fullness, or small degree of swelling, takes place in the parts contiguous to the wound; the lips of the sore become somewhat hard and inflamed; and, in the course of about 24 hours from the operation, a thin watery serum begins to be discharged at the orifice.\n\nIf, by the means employed, relief is not soon obtained, these symptoms generally continue in nearly the same state for two or perhaps three days longer. At this time the violent pain which at first took place becomes still more distressing; but instead of being sharp and acute as before, it is now attended with the sensation of a burning heat, which goes on to increase, and proves, during the whole course of the ailment, a source of constant distress to the patient. The fullness and hardness in the lips of the wound begin to increase, and the swelling in the neighbouring parts gradually extends over the whole members. The parts at last become exceedingly tense and hard; an erysipelas-like inflammatory colour frequently appears over the whole member; the pulse by this time is generally very hard and quick; the pain is now intense, the patient experiencing restless twitches of the tendons occur to a greater or less degree; on some occasions, a locked jaw and other convulsive affections supervene; and all these symptoms continuing to increase, it most frequently happens that the torture under which the patient has been groaning is at last terminated by death.\n\nDifferent opinions have prevailed respecting the cause of these symptoms. By some they have been imputed to wounds of the tendons. By others the tendons are supposed to be so entirely destitute of sensibility, as to be quite incapable of producing so much distress; so that wounds of the nerves they consider, on all such occasions, as the true cause of the various symptoms we have mentioned.\n\nOne or other of these ideas continued to be the only source for explaining the various phenomena found to occur in this malady, till a different opinion was suggested by the late ingenious Mr John Hunter of Lon-\n\nMr Hunter supposed, that all the dreadful symptoms found now and then to be induced by the operation of blood-letting, might be more readily accounted for from an inflamed state of the internal surface of the Hunter's vein, than from any other cause. Such a state of the opinion vein he has often traced in horses that have died of such symptoms from venefaction, and the same appearances have sometimes occurred also in the human body. And on other occasions, inflammation having in this manner been once excited, has been known to terminate in suppuration; and the matter thus produced being in the course of circulation carried to the heart, Mr Hunter supposes that in such cases death may have been induced by that cause alone.\n\nThere can be no reason to doubt the fact held forth by Mr Hunter, that in such instances the vein in which the orifice has been made, has frequently after death been found greatly inflamed: but however ingenious his arguments may be for concluding that the state of the vein is the original cause of all the bad symptoms enumerated, and although we must allow that such an inflammatory affection of a vein must have a considerable influence in aggravating the various symptoms previously induced by other causes; yet we may very fairly conclude, that it could not probably in any one instance be able to account with satisfaction for their first production.\n\nIn many cases the patient, at the very instant of the operation, feels a very painful degree of pain. In some cases, the violence of the pain is almost un-supportable. Now this we can never suppose to have been produced by the mere puncture of a vein; for although the coats of veins are not perhaps entirely destitute of feeling, yet we know well that they are not endowed with such a degree of sensibility as to render it probable that such intense pain could ever be induced by their being punctured in any way whatever. This inflamed state of the veins therefore, as detected by Mr Hunter after death, must be considered rather as being produced by, than as being productive of, such affections; and that such ailments should frequently produce an inflammation of the contiguous veins, is a very probable conjecture. In the course of 48 hours from the operation, when the febrile symptoms are just commencing, such a degree of hardness and evident inflammation is induced over all the parts contiguous to the orifice, that it would be surprising indeed if the vein, which is thus perhaps entirely surrounded with parts highly inflamed, should escape altogether. We shall therefore proceed upon the Really own supposition of this inflamed state of the veins being a thing to the consequence rather than the cause of such ailments; and partial of course we now revert to one or other of the opinions, wounding long ago adopted on this subject, that all the train of a nerve bad symptoms found on some occasions to succeed, venefaction, proceeds either from the wound of a nerve or of a tendon.\n\nThat a partial wound of a nerve will now and then produce very distressing symptoms, no practitioner will deny: but it has been attempted to be shown, that tendons are almost totally destitute of sensibility; and it has therefore been supposed, that their being wounded can never account for the various symptoms known to occur in such cases. There is great reason however to think, that in different instances the same train of symptoms have been induced by different causes; that in one\nWounds.\n\nIn order to prevent as much as possible the consequent inflammation and other symptoms which usually ensue, a considerable quantity of blood should be immediately discharged at the orifice just made; the limb, for several days at least, ought to be kept in a state of perfect rest, care being at the same time taken to keep the muscles of the part in as relaxed a state as possible; the patient should be also kept cool, on a low diet; and, if necessary, gentle laxatives ought to be administered.\n\nWhen, notwithstanding these means, the symptoms, instead of diminishing, rather become more violent; if the lips of the orifice turn hard and more inflamed; if the pain become more considerable, and especially if the swelling begin to spread, other remedies come to be indicated. In this state of the complaint, topical bloodletting, by means of leeches applied as near as possible to the lips of the wound, frequently affords much relief; and when the pulse is full and quick, it even becomes necessary to evacuate large quantities of blood by opening a vein in some other part.\n\nThe external applications usually employed in this state of the complaint are warm emollient fomentations and poultices. In similar affections of other parts no remedies with which we are acquainted would probably be found more successful; but in the complaint now under consideration, all such applications, instead of being productive of any advantage, rather do harm. The heat of the part is here one of the most distressing symptoms; and warm emollient applications rather tend to augment this source of uneasiness. The lips of the wound also are rendered still more hard, swelled, and of course more painful; and the swelling of the contiguous parts is increased. The best external remedies are cooling astringents, especially the tannin applications. The parts chiefly affected being alternately covered over with cloths wet with a solution of saccharum saturni, and pledgets spread with Goulard's cerate, are kept more cool and easy than by any other remedy hitherto used.\n\nThe febrile symptoms which occur must at the same time be attended to, by keeping the patient cool, on a low diet, preserving a lax state of the bowels; and, if necessary, farther quantities of blood ought to be evacuated.\n\nOn account of the violence of the pain, which is sometimes so excessive as to destroy entirely the patient's rest, opiates ought to be freely exhibited; and when twitchings of the tendons and other convulsive symptoms supervene, medicines of this kind become still more necessary. In order, however, to have a proper influence in this state of the complaint, opiates ought to be given in very full doses; otherwise, instead of answering any good purpose, they constantly tend to aggravate the different symptoms, not only by increasing the heat and restlessness, but by having an evident influence in rendering the system more susceptible than it was before of the pain and other distressing effects produced upon it by the wound.\n\nIt often happens, however, either from neglecting the wound or from improper treatment, that all these remedies are had recourse to without any advantage whatever: the fever, pain, and swelling of the parts continue, and convulsive affections of the muscles at last occur, all tending to indicate the most imminent danger.\n\nIn this situation of matters, if we have not immediate recourse to some effectual means, the patient will soon fall a victim to the disorder; and the only remedy from which much real advantage is to be expected, is a free and extensive division of the parts in which the orifice producing all the mischief was at first made. We know well, from the experience of ages, that much more pain and distress of every kind are commonly produced by the partial division either of a nerve or of a tendon, than from any of these parts being at once cut entirely across.\n\nNow the intention of the operation here recommended, is to produce a complete division of the nerve or tendon we suppose to have been wounded by the point of the lancet, and which we consider as the sole cause of all the subsequent distress.\n\nThis operation being attended with a good deal of pain, and being put in practice for the removal of symptoms from which it is perhaps difficult to persuade the patient that much danger can occur, all the remedies we have mentioned should be made trial of before it is proposed; but at the same time, care ought to be taken that the disorder is not allowed to proceed too far before we have recourse to it; for if the patient should be previously much weakened by the feverish symptoms having continued violent for any length of time, neither this remedy nor any other with which we are acquainted would probably have much influence. As soon, therefore, as the course already prescribed has been fairly tried, and is found to be inadequate to the effects expected from it, we ought immediately to have recourse to a free division of the parts affected.\n\nWherever a wounded or ruptured tendon may be situated, the limb should be placed in such a manner as if wounded will most readily admit of the retracted ends of the tendon being brought together; and when in this situation, the muscles of the whole limb in which the injury has happened must be tied down with a roller, so as to prevent them from all kinds of exertion during the cure, endeavouring at the same time to keep the parts easy and relaxed. Thus, in a wound or rupture of the tendon of the rectus muscle of the thigh, the patient's leg should be kept as much as possible stretched out during the cure, while the thigh should be in some degree bent, to relax the muscle itself as far as possible.\n\nIn similar affections of the tendo Achillis, the knee should be kept constantly bent to relax the muscles of the leg, and the foot should be stretched out to admit of the ends of the ruptured tendon being brought into contact. A roller should be applied with a firmness quite sufficient for securing the muscles and tendons in this situation; but care must be taken to prevent it from impeding the circulation. With this view, soft fine flannel should be preferred either to linen or cotton; for being more elastic, it more readily yields to any swelling with which the limb may be attacked.\n\nThe late Dr Monro was the first who gave any accurate directions for the treatment of rupture in the large tendons; and it is perhaps given with more precision, from his having himself experienced the effects of this misfortune in the tendo achillis.\n\nHe used a foot-sock or slipper, made of double quilted ticking, and left open at the toe; from the heel of which a strap went up above the calf of the leg. A strong\nWounds. Strong piece of the same materials went round the calf, and was fastened with a lace. On the back part of this was a buckle, through which the strap of the foot-lock was passed, by which the calf could be brought down, and the foot extended at pleasure. Besides there was a piece of tin applied to the fore part of the leg, to prevent the foot from getting into any improper posture during sleep. After propelling to walk, he put on a shoe with a heel two inches deep; and it was not till the expiration of five months that he ventured to lay aside the tin plate; and he continued the use of the high-heeled shoe for two years.\n\nFrom this treatment a knowledge may be formed of the treatment necessary to be followed in the laceration of tendons of other parts of the body.\n\nIn wounds of the thorax, even though none of the viscera should be wounded, we may yet reasonably expect that a considerable quantity of blood will be extravasated; and this, if very large, must be evacuated if possible. However, it ought to be particularly observed, that this extravasated blood should not be discharged before we are assured that the wounded vessels have done bleeding. When the pulse appears sufficiently strong and equal, the extremities warm, no hiccup or convulsion, and the patient's strength continues, we may then know that the internal hemorrhage has ceased, and that the means for discharging the blood may now be safely used. Matter, water, and blood have sometimes vanished from the cavities of the thorax, and been afterwards discharged by sweat, urine, &c. Yet this but seldom happens; and if we were to trust to nature alone in these cases, it is certain that many would perish from a destruction of the vital viscera by the extravasated blood, who by an artificial extraction of the same blood might have been saved.\n\nWounds of the abdomen must be closed as soon as possible, and then treated as simple wounds; only they ought to be dressed as seldom and expeditiously as possible. Copious bleeding and a spare diet, with other parts of the antiphlogistic regimen, are here absolutely necessary.\n\nIt sometimes happens, that, through a large wound of the abdominal integuments, the intestine comes out without being injured. The most certain method, in all such cases, is to return the protruded part as soon as possible; for although writers in general formerly recommended warm fomentations, &c. to be previously applied, the latest authors upon this subject consider the most natural and proper fomentation to be that which is produced by the heat and moisture of the patient's belly, and that therefore the intestines, if no mortification has taken place, are to be cleared from extraneous matter, and immediately returned.\n\nWhen the wound of the abdomen is large, the intestines easily prolapse, and they are as easily returned. But when part of an intestine has been forced through a narrow wound, it is much more dangerous. For the prolapsed intestine being distended by flatus, or the ingested aliment driven thither by the peristaltic motion, it will become inflamed, tumefied, and incapable of being returned through the stricture of the wound; whence gangrene will soon follow. In this case the utmost care is to be taken to reduce the intestine to its natural size. When this cannot be accomplished by other means, some practitioners of great eminence have even advised the puncturing of the intestine in different places in order to discharge the flatus. This practice has also been recommended in an incarcerated hernia, but is exceedingly disapproved of by Mr. Pott and later writers; and it seems to be very dubious whether any good can possibly arise from it. To puncture any part that is already inflamed, must undoubtedly add to the inflammation; and it is very improbable that the discharge of flatus procured by the punctures would be at all a compensation for the bad consequences produced by the increased inflammation. The method of Celsus is much more eligible: It is to dilate the wound so as to reduce the intestine with ease.\n\nSometimes part of the intestine is lost either by suppuration or gangrene. In this case, all that can be done is to put a single stitch through the wounded bowel, and to fix it to the external wound by passing the future allo through the sides of the wound. The ends of the intestine may perhaps adhere; or at any rate the wound will continue to perform the office of an anus, out of which the faeces will continue to be discharged during life. The directions given by some surgeons about inserting the upper end of the gut into the lower, and stitching them together, are perfectly impracticable; and even if they were practicable, would certainly produce new mortification, which could not but be fatal.\n\nWhen the omentum appears prolapsed, the same general treatment is to be observed; only that, when it is mortified, the dead part may be safely extirpated.\u2014We shall conclude the article of abdominal wounds with a case from the memoirs of the academy of sciences for the year 1795, which shows that we ought not to despair, even though the most desperate symptoms should take place. A madman wounded himself in 18 different places of the abdomen. Eight of these penetrated the cavity, and injured the contained viscera; he had a diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting, tension of the abdomen, with difficult respiration and violent fever, so that his life was despaired of. During the first four days he was bled seven times; and during the greatest part of the cure his diet consisted almost entirely of flesh-broths, with the addition of some mild vegetables. By these means he was not only cured of his wounds, but restored to his right senses. Seventeen months after, he went mad again, and threw himself over a precipice, by which he was instantly killed. On opening the body, the wounds were found to have penetrated the middle lobe of the liver, the intestinum jejunum, and the colon.\n\nSuch extraordinary cures are to be imputed, according to the satisfactory explanation of Mr. J. Bell, to the abdomen being perfectly full, and constantly subjected to strong pressure between the diaphragm and abdominal muscles; which keeps the parts contiguous to a wound closely applied to it, also in some measure prevents the discharge of faeces or even of blood, and gives an opportunity for a very speedy adhesion between the parts.\n\nIn wounds of the head, where the cellular membrane only is affected, and the aponeurosis and periosteum are untouched, phlebotomy, lenient purges, and the use of the common febrifuge medicines, particularly those of the neutral kind, generally remove all the threatening symptoms. When the inflammation is gone off, it leaves on the skin a yellowish tint and a dry scurf, which continue until perspiration takes them away; and upon the removal\nremoval of the disease, the wound immediately recovers a healthy aspect, and soon heals without further trouble. But in the worst kind of these wounds, that is, where a small wound passes through the tela cellulosa and aponeurosis to the periosteum, the patient will admit of more free evacuations by phlebotomy than in the former. In both, the use of warm fomentations is required; but an emollient cataplasm, which is generally forbid in the erysipelasous swellings, may in this latter case be used to great advantage. Where the symptoms are not very pressing, nor the habit very inflammable, this method will prove sufficient; but it sometimes happens that the scalp is too tense, the pain too great, and the symptomatic fever too high, that by waiting for the slow effect of such means the patient runs a risk from the continuance of the fever; or else the injured aponeurosis and periosteum become flabby, produce an abscess, and render the case both tedious and troublesome. A division of the wounded part, by a simple incision down to the bone, about half an inch or an inch in length, will most commonly remove all the bad symptoms; and if it be done in time, will render everything else unnecessary.\n\nThe wounds penetrating into the cavities of the joints do not seem at first alarming; yet, by exposure to the air, the lining membrane of such cavities acquires such a degree of sensibility as to endanger life when they are large. As soon therefore as any extraneous body, pushed into the joint, is removed, the admission of the external air is to be guarded against as much as possible. If the wound be not too large, this may be done by pulling the skin over the wound of the joint; and, to prevent its retraction, rather adhesive plaster, with proper bandaging, is to be used. But when inflammation has come on, repeated and copious blood-letting, together with fomentations, becomes necessary; and as the pain, in these cases, is apt to be violent, opiates must be administered; but should matter be formed in the cavity of the joint, free vent must be given to it.\n\nOf contused and lacerated Wounds.\u2014When the small vessels are ruptured by a blow with any hard instrument without penetrating the skin, at the same time that the solid fibres of the part are crushed, the injury is termed a contusion; and when at the same time the skin is broken, it is termed a contused and lacerated wound.\n\nEvery contusion therefore, whether the skin is broken or not, may be properly reckoned a wound; where the injury is so slight that none of the contents of the small vessels are extravasated, it scarcely deserves to be mentioned. The immediate consequence of a contusion, therefore, is a swelling, by reason of the extravasation just mentioned; and the skin becomes discoloured by the blood stagnating under it; but as this fluid, even though covered by the skin, cannot long remain in the natural state, it thence happens, that the contused part soon loses its florid red colour, and becomes blue or black; the thinner parts being in the meantime gradually taken up by the absorbent vessels. This at last happens to the blood itself; the blue disappears, and is succeeded by a yellowish colour, showing that the blood is now dissolved; after which, the part recovers its former appearance, and the ruptured vessels appear to have united as if no injury had happened.\n\nThese are the symptoms which attend the slightest kind of contusions; but it is evident, that where the blow is so violent as to rupture the blood-vessels or crush some of the large nerves, all the bad consequences which attend simple wounds of those parts will ensue, and they will not be at all alleviated by the circumstance of the skin remaining whole. Hence it is easy to see how a contusion may produce ulcers of the worst kind, gangrene, sphacelus, carious bones, &c.; and if it happen to be on a glandular part, a scirrhus or cancer is very frequently found to ensue. Even the viscera themselves, especially of the abdomen, may be injured by contusions to such a degree as to produce an inflammation, gangrene, or scirrhus, nay instant death, without rupturing the skin.\n\nOf Gun-shot Wounds.\u2014Gun-shot wounds can be considered in no other light than contused wounds. In those made by a musket or pistol ball, the first things to be done are, to extract the ball, or any other extraneous body which may have lodged in the wounded part; and to stop the hemorrhage, if there be an effusion of blood from the rupture of some considerable artery.\n\nIt is frequently necessary to enlarge the wound in order to extract the ball; and if it has gone quite of the ball through (provided the situation of the part wounded will admit of its being done with safety), the wound is then to be laid freely open through its whole length; by which means any extraneous body will be more readily removed, and the cure facilitated.\n\nIn order to get at the ball, or any foreign matter, the probe is to be used as sparingly as possible; and this must appear evident to any one who will only consider the nature of the symptoms attendant on penetrating wounds of the breast or belly, either from a bullet or sharp instrument; the thrusting in a probe to parts under such circumstances being unavoidably a fresh stab on every repetition. Wherever probing is necessary, the finger is to be preferred as the best and truest probe, where it can be used.\n\nIf a ball, or any other foreign body, happen to be lodged near the orifice, or can be perceived by the finger to lie under the skin, though at some distance from the mouth of the wound, we should cut upon it and take it out; but when it is sunk deep, and lies absolutely beyond the reach of the finger, it must appear evident, upon the least reflection, that thrusting, first a long probe in quest of the bullet, and then, as has been likewise practised a long pair of forceps, either with or without teeth, into a wound of that kind, though with some certainty to extract it, must either contuse, or irritate and inflame the parts to a great degree; and consequently do as much, or more, mischief as the ball did at first in forcing its passage to such a length. And should they at the same time lay hold of any considerable artery or nerve along with the ball (which can scarce ever fail of being the case), what shocking consequences would attend such a proceeding! Nor would attempts of this sort be less injurious, if a bullet should happen to be lodged in the cavity of the belly or breast. Such attempts are the less necessary, because a great number of instances have occurred, where balls have been quietly lodged in several parts of the body, till after many years they have worked themselves a passage towards the surface, and were very easily extracted; and many cases also where balls have been entirely left behind.\n\nIn case the wound be occasioned by a musket or pistol\nWounds.\n\nflot shot, and of course be small, it will be necessary to dilate the wound without delay, provided the nature of the part will permit of this with safety; for in wounds near a joint, or in very membranous or tendinous parts, the knife, as well as forceps, should be put under some restraint; nor should any more opening be made than what is absolutely requisite for the free discharge of the matter lodged within.\n\nWhere the wounded person has not suffered any great loss of blood, and this is generally the case, it will be advisable to open a vein immediately, and take from the arm a large quantity; and to repeat bleeding as circumstances may require, the second, and even the third day. Repeated bleedings in the beginning are followed by many advantages. They prevent pain and a good deal of inflammation, lessen any feverish assaults, and seldom fail to obviate impromptuations, and a long train of complicated symptoms which are wont otherwise to interrupt the cure, miserably harass the poor patient, and too often endanger his life. Even where the feverish symptoms run high, and there is almost a certainty that matter is forming, bleeding, in such a state, is very frequently of great advantage.\n\nFor the first twelve days after the wound has been received, it will be proper to observe a cooling regimen, both in respect of the medicines that may be prescribed, and the diet requisite for the support of the patient. It is likewise absolutely necessary that the body be constantly kept open. Unless, therefore, nature does this office of herself, a stool should be every day procured, either by emollient clysters, or some gentle laxative taken at the mouth; and whenever there is much pain in the wounded parts, immediate recourse must be had to opium.\n\nAs to external applications, whatever is of a hot spirituous nature is remarkably injurious on these occasions, and what no wounded part can in any degree bear. The wound may be dressed with pledgets of any emollient ointment; the whole being covered with a common poultice, or, in some cases, the preparations of lead may be used. An opiate should now be administered; and the part affected being placed in the easiest and most convenient posture, the patient should be laid to rest. The formation of matter, in every contused wound, is an object of the first importance; for, till this takes place, there is often reason to suspect that gangrene may happen. With a view to hasten suppuration, the warm poultices should be frequently renewed, and they should be continued till the tension and swelling, with which wounds of this kind are usually attended, be removed, and till the sore has acquired a red, healthy, granulating appearance, and then it is to be treated like a common ulcer.\n\nGun-shot wounds are commonly covered from the beginning with deep floughs, and various remedies are recommended for removing these. Every appearance, however, of this kind with which they are attended proceeds entirely from contusion; and, excepting the injury be extensive, the flough is not often perceptible, or it is so thin as to come away along with the matter at the first or second dressing. Although emollient poultices be extremely useful, they ought to be no longer continued than till the effects already mentioned are produced; otherwise they will not only relax the parts, but also produce too copious a discharge of matter, which is sometimes attended with great danger. A too copious flow of matter may proceed from different causes; but in whatever way it may have been produced, the practice to be adopted must be nearly the same. Every collection which appears must have a free outlet, and the limb laid in that posture which will most readily admit of its running off. In such circumstances, nourishing diet and Peruvian bark in considerable quantities are highly useful. When the discharge continues copious, in spite of every effort to check it, detached pieces of bone or some extraneous matter are probably the cause. In such a situation nothing will lessen the quantity of matter till such substances be removed. The wound ought therefore again to be examined, and any loose bodies taken away. Pieces of cloth have been known to be removed by fetons, when that method was practicable, after every other method had failed. Opium is frequently used in checking an excessive discharge, when it happens to be kept up by irritation.\n\nAlthough no considerable hemorrhagy may happen on first receiving a gun-shot wound; yet after the floughs commonly produced upon such occasions have come off, some considerable arteries may be exposed, and then a dangerous hemorrhagy may ensue. The hemorrhagy is often preceded by a great heat in the injured parts, and with a throbbing pulsatory pain. At this period it may frequently be prevented by plentiful blood-letting, particularly local. But if the hemorrhagy has fairly taken place, and from arteries of considerable size, nothing will restrain it but the proper application of ligatures. As the discharge in these cases would often prove dangerous before the surgeon could be procured, the attendants should be furnished with a tourniquet, with directions to apply it, upon the first appearance of blood.\n\nTill of late years the scarifying of gun-shot wounds was a practice which prevailed very universally among improper surgeons; and it was expected by this, that the floughs with which wounds are sometimes covered would sooner separate, and that the cure would thereby be more readily performed. It is now, however, known, that this practice, instead of being useful, very generally does harm by increasing the inflammation. It should therefore be laid entirely aside.\n\nWhen a gun-shot wound cannot easily or safely be laid open from one end to the other, perhaps it may be proper to introduce a cord through the sinus. This, however, should not be attempted till the first or inflammatory state of the wound is over; but when a cord cannot be properly introduced, on account of the situation or direction of the wound, compression may prove equally useful here as in cases of punctured wounds.\n\nMortification happening after gun-shot wounds, is to be treated in the same manner as if it had arisen from any other cause, only bark is not to be promiscuously used; as, in plethoric habits, it may prove hurtful, though in debilitated relaxed habits it will be extremely useful; but even in such it should never be given while much pain and tension continue.\n\nOf Wounds and Injuries of the Head producing Fractures and Depressions.\u2014When the brain is compressed, symptoms a set of symptoms ensue, extremely dangerous, though of compressive nature; they do not make their appearance till after a considerable interval. But at whatever time they appear, they are uniformly of the same kind, and age.\nWounds are in general as follows: drowsiness, giddiness, and stupor, dimness of sight, dilatation of the pupil; and, where the injury done to the head is great, there is commonly a discharge of blood from the eyes, nose, or ears. Sometimes the fractured bone can be discovered through the integuments, at other times it cannot. There is an irregular and oppressed pulse, and snoring or apoplectic fever in breathing. There is likewise nausea and vomiting, with an involuntary discharge of faeces and urine. Among the muscles of the extremities and other parts, there is loss of voluntary motion, convulsive tremors in some parts of the body, and palsy in others, especially in that side of the body which is opposite to the injured part of the head.\n\nSome of the milder of these symptoms, as vertigo, stupor, and a temporary loss of sensibility, are frequently induced by slight blows upon the head, but commonly soon disappear, either by rest alone, or by the means to be afterwards pointed out. But when any other symptoms ensue, such as dilatation of the pupils, and especially when much blood is discharged from the eyes, nose, and ears, and that there is an involuntary discharge of faeces and urine, it may be reasonably concluded that compression of the brain is induced.\n\nThe cavity of the cranium, in the healthy and natural state, is everywhere completely filled by the brain; whatever therefore diminishes that cavity, will produce a compression of the brain.\n\nThe causes producing such a diminution may be of various kinds, as fracture and depression of the bones of the cranium; the forcible introduction of any extraneous body into the cavity of the cranium; effusion of blood, serum, pus, or any other fluid; the thickness and irregularity of the bones of the cranium in certain diseases, as in lues venerea, rickets, or spina ventosa; or water collected in hydrocephalous cases. The first set of causes shall be considered in their order. The four last mentioned belong to the province of the physician, and have been considered in a former part of this work.\n\nFractures of the cranium have been differently distinguished by different authors; but it seems sufficient to divide them into those attended with depression, and those which are not.\n\nIn fracture and depression of the cranium, the treatment ought to be\u2014to discover the situation and extent of the fracture; and to obviate the effects of the injury done to the brain, by raising or removing all the depressed parts of the bone.\n\nWhen the integuments corresponding to the injury done to the bone are cut or lacerated, and, as is sometimes the case, entirely removed, the state of the fracture is immediately discovered; but when the integuments of the skull remain entire, even though the general symptoms of fracture be present, there is sometimes much difficulty in ascertaining it. When, however, any external injury appears, particularly a tumor from a recent contusion, attended by the symptoms already described, there can be no doubt of the existence of a fracture. But it sometimes happens that compression exists without the smallest appearance of tumor. In such cases, the whole head ought to be shaved, when an inflammatory spot may frequently be observed. Sometimes the place of the fracture has been discovered by the patient applying the hand frequently on or near some particular part of the head.\n\nWhen the symptoms of a compressed brain are evidently marked, no time ought to be lost in setting about an examination of the state of the cranium, wherever appearances point out, or even lead us to conjecture, in what part a fracture may be situated. For this purpose an incision is to be made upon the spot through the integuments to the surface of the bone, which must be sufficiently exposed to admit of a free examination.\n\nSome authors have recommended a crucial incision; others one in form of the letter T; while many advise a considerable part of the integuments to be entirely removed. But as it is more agreeable to the present mode of practice to save as much of the skin as possible, a simple incision is generally preferred, unless the fracture run in different directions, and then the incision must vary accordingly. It will frequently happen, that a considerable part of the integuments must be separated from the skull, in order to obtain a distinct view of the full extent of the fracture; but no part of the integuments is to be entirely removed.\n\nWhen blood-vessels of any considerable size are divided, either before or in time of the examination, they ought to be allowed to bleed freely, as in no case whatever is the loss of blood attended with more advantage than the present. When, however, it appears that the patient has lost a sufficient quantity, the vessels ought to be secured.\n\nAfter the integuments have been divided, if the skull be found to be fractured and depressed, the nature of the case is rendered evident; but even where there is no external appearance of fracture, tumor, discoloration, or other injury, if the patient continue to labour under symptoms of a compressed brain, if the pericranium has been separated from the bone, and especially if the bone has lost its natural appearance, and has acquired a pale white or dusky yellow hue, the trepan ought to be applied without hesitation at the place where these appearances mark the principal seat of the injury.\n\nAgain, although no mark either of fracture or of any disease underneath should appear on the outer table of the bone, yet there is a possibility that the inner table may be fractured and depressed. This indeed is not a common occurrence, but it happens probably more frequently than surgeons have been aware of; and where it does happen, the injury done to the brain is as great, and attended with as much danger, as where the whole thickness of the bone is beat in. The application of the trepan is therefore necessary.\n\nBut if, after the application of the trepan, it happens that no mark of injury appears either in the outer or inner table in that part, or in the dura mater below it, and that the symptoms of a compressed brain still continue, a fracture in some other part is to be suspected; or that kind of fracture termed by practitioners counter fracture, where the skull is fractured and sometimes depressed on the opposite side to, or at a distance from, the part where the injury was received. This is fortunately not a very frequent occurrence, and has even been doubted by some; but different instances of it have, beyond all question, been found. If therefore the operation of the trepan has been performed, and no fracture is\nWounds. is discovered, no extravasation appears on the surface of the brain; and if blood-letting and other means usually employed do not remove the symptoms of compression, the operator is to search for a fracture in some other part. The whole head should again be examined with much accuracy; and, by pressing deliberately but firmly over every part of it, if the smallest degree of sensibility remains, the patient will show signs of pain, either by moans or by raising his hands, when pressure is made over the fractured part. In this way fractures have been frequently detected, which might otherwise have been concealed.\n\nHaving now considered everything preparatory to the operation of the trepan, we shall next point out the means best adapted for the removal or elevation of a depressed portion of the bone.\n\nThe first thing to be done is, after shaving the head, to make an incision as deep as the bone, and directly upon the course of the fracture.\n\nThe patient ought to be laid on a table, with a mattress under him, while his head is placed upon a pillow, and secured by an affiant. When the extent of the fracture has been determined, and the bleeding from the incision stopped, the depressed bone is now to be elevated; but previous to this it is necessary to search for detached pieces. Should any be found, they ought to be removed by a pair of forceps adapted to this purpose. By the same instrument any splinters of bone which may have been beaten in may be removed; but when a part of the bone is beaten in beyond the level of the rest of the cranium, as much of the pericranium is then to be removed by a raspator, as will allow the trephine to be applied; or, if the operator incline, for the sake of dispatch, he may use the trepan; or the operation may be begun and finished with the trephine, while the trepan may perform the middle and principal part of the work. This part of the work is begun by making a hole with the perforator, deep enough to fix the central pin of the trephine, in order to prevent the saw from slipping out of its central course, till it has formed a groove sufficiently deep to be worked steadily in; and then the pin is to be removed. If the bone be thick, the teeth of the saw must be cleaned now and then by the brush during the perforation, and dipped in oil as often as it is cleaned, which will considerably facilitate the motion, and render it more expeditious; making it at the same time much less disagreeable to the patient, if he possess his senses. That no time may be lost, the operator ought to be provided with two instruments of the same size, or at least to have two heads which can be readily fitted to the same handle.\n\nAfter having made some progress in the operation, the groove ought to be frequently examined with a pick-tooth, or some such instrument, in order to discover its depth; and if one side happen to be deeper than the other, the operator ought to press more on that side which is shallowest. Precautions are more particularly necessary when the operation is performed upon a part of the skull which is of unequal thickness, especially after the instrument has passed the diploe. And though wounds be it said by writers in general that the instrument may be worked boldly till it comes at the diploe (which is generally known by the appearance of blood), yet the operator should be upon his guard in this point, examining from time to time if the piece be loose, lest through inadvertence the dura mater be wounded; for in some parts of the skull there is naturally very little diploe, and in old subjects scarcely any. It ought likewise to be remembered, that the skulls of children are very thin. When the piece begins to vacillate, it ought to be snapped off with the forceps or levator; for the sawing ought by no means to be continued till the bone be cut quite through, otherwise the instrument may plunge in upon the brain, or at least injure the dura mater (B). If the inner edge of the perforation be left ragged, it is to be smoothed with the lenticular, to prevent it from irritating the dura mater. Particular care is to be taken in using the instrument, lest it should press too much upon the brain.\n\nThe next step is to raise the depressed part of the bone with the levator, or to extract the fragments of the bone, grumous blood, or any extraneous body. After this, if there appear reason to apprehend that blood, lymph, or matter, is contained under the dura mater, it ought to be cautiously opened with a lancet, endeavouring to avoid the blood-vessels running upon it, or lying immediately under it.\n\nWhen the trepan is to be used on account of a fissure in which the bone will not yield, the instrument should be applied so as to include part of it, if not directly over it, as it is most probable that the extravasated fluid will be found directly under it. And when the fissure is of great extent, it may be proper to make a perforation at each end, if the whole can be conveniently brought into view; and in some cases several perforations may become necessary.\n\nWhen it is proposed to make several perforations to remove depressed fragments of the bone which are firmly fixed, and having the internal surface larger than the external, or to raise them sufficiently, it is necessary to apply the trepan as near the fractured parts as possible; making the perforations join each other, to prevent the trouble of cutting the intermediate spaces.\n\nWhen the skull is injured over a future, and it is thought advisable to use the trepan, a perforation ought to be made on each side of the future, especially in young subjects, in which the dura mater adheres more strongly than in adults; because there cannot be a free communication between the one side and the other, on account of the attachment of that membrane to the future.\n\nAfter the elevation of the depressed pieces, or the removal of those which are quite loose, the extraction of the extraneous bodies, and the evacuation of extravasated fluids, &c., the fore is to be dressed in the lightest and easiest manner; all that is necessary being to apply a pledget of fine scraped lint, covered with simple ointment, to that part of the dura mater which is laid bare by\n\n(B) A trepanning instrument has been invented by Mr Rodman, surgeon, Paisley, which has no central pin, and it is so contrived that any given thickness of bone may be cut, so that the danger from other instruments is by the use of this entirely avoided. See a more detailed account of this instrument under ABAPTISTON.\nby the trepan, or otherwise; after which the edges of the scalp are to be brought together or nearly so, and another pledget laid along the whole course of the wound; a piece of fine soft linen is to be laid over all, and the dressings may be retained in their place by a common night-cap applied close to the head, and properly fixed.\n\nThe patient is to be placed in as easy a position in bed as possible, with his head and shoulders elevated a little more than ordinary. If the operation be attended with success, the patient will soon begin to show favourable symptoms; he will soon show signs of increasing sensibility, and the original bad symptoms will gradually disappear. After this he ought to be kept as quiet as possible; proper laxatives are to be administered, and such as may be left of a nauseating nature. His food ought to be simple and easy of digestion, and his drink of the most dilute kind. If he complain of the wound being uneasy, an emollient poultice should be immediately applied, and renewed three or four times in the twenty-four hours. By these means there will commonly be a free suppuration from the whole surface of the fore.\n\nEvery time the wound is dressed, the purulent matter ought to be wiped off from it with a fine warm sponge; and if any degree of sloughiness take place on the dura mater or parts adjacent, it will then be completely separated. Granulations will begin to form, which will continue to increase till the whole arise to a level with the surface of the cranium. The edges of the fore are now to be dressed with cerate straps, and the rest of it covered with fine soft lint, kept gently pressed on by the night-cap properly tied. In this way the cure will go on favourably; luxuriance of granulations will commonly be prevented; the parts will cicatrize kindly; and as all the skin has been preserved in making the first incision, the cicatrix will be but little observed.\n\nBut things do not always proceed in this favourable manner. Sometimes in a few hours after the operation the patient is seized with a kind of restlessness, tossing his arms, and endeavouring to move himself in bed, while the symptoms of a complicated brain remain nearly the same as formerly. In this case, especially if the pulse be quick and strong, the patient ought to be bled freely, as there will be reason to suspect some tendency to inflammation in the brain. Sometimes, though the trepan has been properly applied, the symptoms are not relieved, on account of extravasated fluids collected internally under the dura mater, or between the pia mater and brain, or in the cavity of the ventricles. The danger in these cases will be in proportion to the depth of the collection. Particular attention therefore ought always to be paid to the state of the dura mater after the perforation has been made. If blood be collected below the dura mater, this membrane will be found tense, dark coloured, elastic, and even livid; in which case, an opening becomes absolutely necessary to discharge the extravasated fluid. Gentle scratches are to be made with a scalpel, till a probe or directory can be introduced; upon which the membrane is to be sufficiently divided in a longitudinal, and sometimes even in a cruciate direction, till an outlet to the fluid be given.\n\nAfter the dura mater has been cut in this manner, there is some danger of the brain protruding at the opening; but the danger from this is not equal to the bad effects arising from effused fluids compressing the brain.\n\nA troublesome and alarming appearance now and then follows the operation of the trepan; namely, the excrescences called fungii, formerly supposed to grow immediately from the surface of the brain, but which, in general, originate from the surface of the dura mater or cut edge of the bone granulating too luxuriantly.\n\nIt often happens that they possess little sensibility; and then the best method to prevent their rising to any great height is to touch them frequently with lunar caustic; but some cases occur where their sensibility is so great that they cannot be touched, unless they hang by a small neck; and then a ligature may be put round them, and tightened from time to time till they drop off, which will commonly be in the course of a few days. It seldom happens, however, that there is any occasion for applying such means for the removal of these tumors, for they generally fall off as the perforations of the bone fill up.\n\nIf they do not, as the connection between them and the brain will be then in a great measure intercepted, they may be with more safety removed, either by excision, by cauticle, or by ligature.\n\nThe cure being thus far completed, only a small cicatrix will remain, and in general the parts will be nearly as firm as at first; but when much of the integuments have been separated or destroyed, as they are never regenerated, the bone will be left covered only by a thin cuticle, with some small quantity of cellular substance. When this is the case, the person ought to wear a piece of lead or tin, properly fitted and lined with flannel, to protect it from the cold and other external injuries.\n\nThis is the method now commonly practised in cases of compression; but it frequently happens, that instead of compression, such a degree of concussion takes place that no affluence from the trepan can be attended with any advantage; for the effects of concussion are totally different from those of compression, and therefore to be removed in a different manner.","sp":442,"ep":454},{"h":"WOUNDS","t":"in Farriery.

But this was undoubtedly adding sorrow to sorrow, and was consonant neither to reason nor humanity. Wherefore it was first ordained by King Henry I. that if any person escaped alive out of the ship, it should be no wreck; and afterwards King Henry II. by his charter, declared, that if on the coasts of either England, Poictou, Oleron, or Gascony, any ship should be distressed, and\nand either man or beast should escape or be found there-\nin alive, the goods should remain to the owners, if they\nclaimed them within three months; but otherwise should\nbe esteemed a wreck, and should belong to the king, or\nother lord of the franchise. This was again confirmed\nwith improvements by King Richard I.; who, in the\nsecond year of his reign, not only established these con-\ncessions, by ordaining that the owner, if he was ship-\nwrecked and escaped, omnes res suas liberas et quietas\nhaberet, but also, that if he perished, his children, or in\ndefault of them, his brethren and sisters, should retain\nthe property; and in default of brother or sister, then\nthe goods should remain to the king (A). And the\nlaw, as laid down by Bracton in the reign of Henry III.,\nseems still to have improved in its equity. For then, if\nnot only a dog (for instance) escaped, by which the\nowner might be discovered, but if any certain mark\nwere set on the goods, by which they might be known\nagain, it was held to be no wreck. And this is cer-\ntainly most agreeable to reason; the rational claim of\nthe king being only founded upon this, that the true\nowner cannot be ascertained. Afterwards, in the first\nstatute of Westminster, the time of limitation of claims,\ngiven by the charter of Henry II., is extended to a year\nand a day, according to the usage of Normandy: and\nit enacts, that if any man, a dog, or a cat, escape alive,\nthe vessel shall not be adjudged a wreck. These ani-\nmals, as in Bracton, are only put for examples; for it\nis now held, that not only if any live thing escape, but\nif proof can be made of the property of any of the goods\nor lading which come to shore, they shall not be for-\nfeited as wreck. The statute further ordains, that the\nsheriff of the county shall be bound to keep the goods a\nyear and a day (as in France for one year, agreeable to\nthe maritime laws of Oleron, and in Holland for a year\nand a half), that if any man can prove a property in\nthem, either in his own right or by right of representa-\ntion, they shall be restored to him without delay; but\nif no such property be proved within that time, they\nthen shall be the king's. If the goods are of a perish-\nable nature, the sheriff may sell them, and the money\nshall be liable in their stead. This revenue of wrecks\nis frequently granted out to lords of manors as a royal\nfranchise; and if any one be thus intitled to wrecks in\nhis own land, and the king's goods are wrecked there-\non, the king may claim them at any time, even after\nthe year and day.\n\nIt is to be observed, that, in order to constitute a le-\ngal wreck, the goods must come to land. If they con-\ntinue at sea, the law distinguishes them by the barbarous\nand uncouth appellations of jettam, flotsam, and lagan.\nJettam is where goods are cast into the sea, and there\nsink and remain under water: flotsam is where they\ncontinue swimming on the surface of the waves: lagan\nis where they are sunk in the sea, but tied to a cork or\nbuoy, in order to be found again. These are also the\nking's, if no owner appears to claim them; but if any\nowner appears, he is intitled to recover the possession.\n\nVol. XX. Part II.\n\n(A) In like manner Constantine the Great, finding that by the imperial law the revenue of wrecks was given to\nthe prince's treasury or fiscus, restrained it by an edict (Cod. ii. 5. i.) and ordered them to remain to the owners;\nadding this humane expostulation: \"Quod enim jus habet fiscus in aliena calamitate, ut de re tam iucuosa com-\npendium seceatur.\"\nWRECK is punished by the statute 8 Eliz. c. 13, with a forfeiture of 100l. or outlawry. Moreover, by the statute of Geo. II. pilfering any goods cast adrift is declared to be petty larceny; and many other salutary regulations are made, for the more effectually preserving ships of any nation in distress.\n\nBy the civil law, to destroy persons shipwrecked, or prevent their saving the ship, is capital. And to steal even a plank from a vessel in distress or wrecked, makes the party liable to answer for the whole ship and cargo. The laws also of the Visigoths, and the most early Neapolitan constitutions, punished with the utmost severity all those who neglected to assist any ship in distress, or plundered any goods cast on shore.\n\nWREN.

When very young he discovered a surprising genius for the mathematics; in which science he made great advances before he was sixteen years old. In 1657, he was made professor of astronomy at Gresham college, London; which he resigned in 1662, on his being chosen to the Savilian professorship of astronomy in Oxford: he was next year created doctor of laws, and in 1663 was elected fellow of the Royal Society. He was one of the commissioners for the reparation of St Paul's; and in 1665 travelled into France, to examine the most beautiful edifices there, when he made many curious observations. At his return to England, he drew a noble plan for rebuilding the city of London after the fire, which he presented to parliament; and upon the decease of Sir John Denham in 1668, was made surveyor-general of his majesty's works; and from that time had the direction of a great number of public edifices, by which he acquired the highest reputation. He built the magnificent theatre at Oxford, St Paul's cathedral, the churches of St Stephen Walbrook, and St Mary-le-Bow, the Monument, the modern part of the palace of Hampton Court, Chelsea college, one of the wings of Greenwich hospital, and many other beautiful edifices.

And, according to Fitzherbert, a writ is said to be a formal letter of the king in parchment, sealed with his seal, and directed to some judge, officer, or minister, &c., at the suit of a subject, for the cause briefly expressed, which is to be determined in the proper court according to law.\n\nWrits, in civil actions, are either original or judicial: original, are such as are issued out of the court of chancery for the summoning of a defendant to appear, and are granted before the suit is commenced, in order to begin the same; and judicial writs issue out of the court where the original is returned, after the suit is begun. See Process.\n\nThe original writ is the foundation of the suit. See Suit.\n\nWhen a person hath received an injury, and thinks it worth his while to demand a satisfaction for it, he is to consider with himself, or take advice, what redress the law has given for that injury; and thereupon is to make application or suit to the crown, the fountain of all justice, for that particular specific remedy which he is determined or advised to pursue. As for money due on bond, an action of debt; for goods detained without force, an action of detenue or trover; or, if taken with force, an action of trepans vi et armis; or, to try the title of lands, a writ of entry or action of trespass in ejectment; or for any consequential injury received, a special action on the case. To this end he is to sue out, or purchase by paying the stated fees, an original or original writ, from the court of chancery, which is the officina justitiae, the shop or mint of justice, wherein all the king's writs are framed. It is a mandatory letter from the king in parchment, sealed with his great seal, and directed to the sheriff of the county wherein the injury is committed, or supposed to be, requiring him to command the wrong-doer or party accused, either to do justice to the complainant, or else to appear in court, and answer the accusation against him. Whatever the sheriff does in pursuance of this writ, he must return or certify to the court of common-pleas, together with the writ itself: which is the foundation of the jurisdiction of that court, being the king's warrant for the judges to proceed to the determination of the cause. For it was a maxim introduced by the Normans, that there should be\nbe no proceedings in common-pleas before the king's justices without his original writ; because they held it unfit that those justices, being only the substitutes of the crown, should take cognizance of any thing but what was thus expressly referred to their judgement. However, in small actions, below the value of forty shillings, which are brought in the court-baron or county-court, no royal writ is necessary; but the foundation of such suits continue to be (as in the times of the Saxons), not by original writ, but by plaint; that is, by a private memorial tendered in open court to the judge, wherein the party injured sets forth his cause of action: and the judge is bound of common right to administer justice therein, without any special mandate from the king. Now indeed even the royal writs are held to be demandable of common right, on paying the usual fees: for any delay in the granting them, or setting an unusual or exorbitant price upon them, would be a breach of magna charta, c. 29. \"nulli vend.mus, nulli negabimus, aut differemus iustitiam vel rectum.\"\n\nOriginal writs are either optional or peremptory; or, in the language of our law, they are either a praecipe or a fit te feceritis securum. The praecipe is in the alternative, commanding the defendant to do the thing required, or show the reason wherefore he hath not done it. The use of this writ is where something certain is demanded by the plaintiff, which is in the power of the defendant himself to perform; as, to restore the possession of land, to pay a certain liquidated debt, to perform a specific covenant, to render an account, and the like; in all which cases the writ is drawn up in the form of a praecipe or command, to do thus, or show cause to the contrary; giving the defendant his choice to redress the injury or stand the suit. The other species of original writs is called a fit feceritis securum, from the words of the writ; which directs the sheriff to cause the defendant to appear in court, without any option given him, provided the plaintiff gives the sheriff security effectually to prosecute his claim. This writ is in use where nothing is specifically demanded, but only a satisfaction in general; to obtain which, and minister complete redress, the intervention of some judicature is necessary. Such are writs of trespass, or on the case, wherein no debt or other specific thing is sued for in certain, but only damages to be assessed by a jury. For this end the defendant is immediately called upon to appear in court, provided the plaintiff gives good security of prosecuting his claim. Both species of writs are tested, or witnessed, in the king's own name; \"witnessest ourself at Westminster,\" or wherever the chancery may be held.\n\nThe security here spoken of, to be given by the plaintiff for prosecuting his claim, is common to both writs, though it gives denomination only to the latter. The whole of it is at present become a mere matter of form; and John Doe and Richard Roe are always returned as the standing pledges for this purpose.\u2014The ancient use of them was to answer for the plaintiff, who in case he brought an action without cause, or failed in the prosecution of it when brought, was liable to an amercement from the crown for raising a false accusation; and so the form of the judgement fell is. In like manner, as by the Gothic constitutions no person was permitted to lay a complaint against another nisi sub scriptura aut specificatione trium testium, quod allium vellet perseguiri: and, as by the laws of Sancho I. king of Portugal, damages were given against a plaintiff who prosecuted a groundless action.\n\nThe day on which the defendant is ordered to appear in court, and on which the sheriff is to bring in the writ, and report how far he has obeyed it, is called the return of the writ; it being then returned by him to the king's justices at Westminster. And it is always made returnable at the distance of at least 15 days from the date or test, that the defendant may have time to come up to Westminster, even from the most remote parts of the kingdom; and upon some day in one of the four terms, in which the court sits for the dispatch of business.","sp":456,"ep":457},{"h":"WRITING","t":"the art or act of signifying and conveying our ideas to others, by letters or characters visible to the eye. See COMPOSITION, GRAMMAR, and LANGUAGE.\n\nThe most ancient remains of writing, which have been transmitted to us, are upon hard substances, such as stones and metals, which were used by the ancients for edicts and matters of public notoriety; the decalogue was written on two tables of stone; but this practice was not peculiar to the Jews, for it was used by most of the eastern nations, as well as by the Greeks and Romans; and therefore the ridicule which Voltaire attempts to cast upon that part of the book of Genesis, where the people are commanded to write the law on stones, is absurd; for what is there said by no means implies, that other materials might not be used on common occasions. The laws penal, civil, and ceremonial, among the Greeks, were engraven on tables of brass which were called cyrbes.\n\nWe find that wood was also used for writing on in different countries. In the Sloanian library (No. 4852) are fix specimens of Kufic writing, on boards about two feet in length, and six inches in depth. The Chinese, before the invention of paper, wrote or engraved with an iron tool upon thin boards or on bamboo. Pliny says, that table books of wood were in use before the time of Homer. These table books were called by the Romans pupillares. The wood was cut into thin slices, and finely planed and polished. The writing was at first upon the bare wood, with an iron instrument called a stylus. In later times these tables were usually waxed over, and written upon with that instrument. The matter written upon the tables which were thus waxed over was easily effaced, and by smoothing the wax new matter might be substituted in the place of what had been written before. The Greeks and Romans continued the use of waxed table-books long after the use of papyrus, leaves, and skins, became common, because they were so convenient for correcting extemporary compositions.\n\nTable books of ivory are still used for memorandums, but they are commonly written upon with black lead pencils. The practice of writing on table-books covered with wax was not entirely laid aside till the commencement of the 14th century.\n\nThe bark of trees was also used for writing by the ancients, and is still used in several parts of Asia. The same thing may be said of the leaves of trees. It is needless to observe the use of parchment and vellum, papyrus and paper, for writing; it is too well known.\nThe method of fabricating these substances has been already described as they occurred in the order of the alphabet.\n\nIt is obvious, that when men wrote, or rather engraved, on hard substances, instruments of metal were necessary, such as the chisel and the fly-pan; but the latter was chiefly used for writing upon boards, waxed tablets, or on bark.\n\nWhen the ancients wrote on softer materials than wood or metal, other instruments were used for writing with, of which reeds and canes seem to have been the first. Reeds and canes are still used as instruments for writing by the Tartars, the Indians, the Persians, the Turks, and the Greeks. Pencils made of hair are used by the Chinese for their writing: they first liquefy their ink, and dip their pencils into it. Hair-pencils have likewise been used for writing in Europe. Large capital letters were made with them from the time of the Roman emperors till the 16th century. After the invention of printing they were drawn by the illuminators. Quills of geese, swans, peacocks, crows, and other birds, have been used in these western parts for writing with, but how long is not easy to ascertain. St Isidore of Seville, who lived about the middle of the 7th century, describes a pen made of a quill as used in his time.\n\nMethod of restoring decayed Writings. In the 77th volume of the Phil. Trans., there is a paper on this subject by Sir Charles Blagden. One of the best methods he found upon experiment to be, covering the letters with phlogisticated or prussic alkali, with the addition of a diluted mineral acid; upon the application of which, the letters changed very speedily to a deep blue colour, of great beauty and intensity. To prevent the spreading of the colour, which, by blotting the parchment, detracts greatly from the legibility, the alkali should be put on first, and the diluted acid added upon it. The method found to answer best has been, to spread the alkali thin with a feather over the traces of the letters, and then to touch it gently, as nearly upon or over the letters as can be done with the diluted acid, by means of a feather or a bit of stick cut to a blunt point. Though the alkali should occasion no sensible change of colour, yet the moment the acid comes upon it, every trace of a letter turns at once to a fine blue, which soon acquires its full intensity, and is beyond comparison stronger than the colour of the original trace had been. If, then, the corner of a bit of blotting paper be carefully and dexterously applied near the letters, so as to imbibe the superfluous liquor, the staining of the parchment may be in a great measure avoided; for it is this superfluous liquor which, absorbing part of the colouring matter from the letters, becomes a dye to whatever it touches. Care must be taken not to bring the blotting paper in contact with the letters, because the colouring matter is soft whilst wet, and may easily be rubbed off. The acid chiefly employed was the marine; but both the vitriolic and nitrous succeed very well. They should be so far diluted as not to be in danger of corroding the parchment, after which the degree of strength does not seem to be a matter of much nicety.\n\nMethod of Copying Writings. The ingenious Mr Watt, some years ago, invented a method of copying writings very speedily, and without the possibility of committing mistakes. A piece of thin unfixed paper is to be taken exactly of the size of the paper to be copied; it is to be moistened with water, or, what is better, with the following liquid: Take of distilled vinegar two pounds weight, dissolve it in one ounce of boric acid; then take four ounces of oyster-shells calcined to whiteness, and carefully freed from their brown crust; put them into the vinegar, shake the mixture frequently for 24 hours, then let it stand until it deposits its sediment; filter the clear part through unfixed paper into a glass vessel; then add two ounces of the best blue Aleppo galls bruised, and place the liquor in a warm place, shaking it frequently for 24 hours; then filter the liquor again through unfixed paper, and add to it after filtration one quart, ale measure, of pure water. It must then stand 24 hours, and be filtered again if it shows a disposition to deposit any sediment, which it generally does. When the paper has been wet with this liquid, put it between two thick unfixed papers to absorb the superfluous moisture; then lay it over the writing to be copied, and put a piece of clean writing paper above it. Put the whole on the board of a rolling-press, and press them through the rolls, as is done in printing copperplates, and a copy of the writing shall appear on both sides of the thin moistened paper; on one side in a reversed order and direction, but on the other side in the natural order and direction of the lines.\n\nWRITTEN MOUNTAINS.

A little before the restoration of King Charles II, he became a gentleman commoner of Queen's college Oxford, where he was reconciled by Dr Barlow to the Protestant religion, which he had a little before abandoned in his travels. He afterwards entered himself in the Middle-temple, but soon quitted the study of the law for pursuits more agreeable to his own genius, as well as to the taste of the age. Upon writing his first play, entitled, Love in a Wood, or St James's Park, which was acted in 1672, he became acquainted with several of the celebrated wits both of the court and town, and likewise with the duchess of Cleveland. Some time after appeared his comedies, called The Gentleman Dancing Master, the Plain Dealer, and the Country Wife; all which were acted with applause. George duke of Buckingham had a very high esteem for him, and bestowed on him several advantageous posts. King Charles also showed him signal marks of favour; and once gave him a proof of his esteem, which perhaps never any foreign prince before had given to a private gentleman. Mr Wycherley being ill of a fever, at his lodgings in Bow-street, the king did him the honour of a visit. Finding him extremely weakened, he commanded him to take a journey to the south of France, and assured him, at the same time, that he would order him \u00a3500 to defray the charges of the journey. Mr Wycherley accordingly went into France; and having spent the winter there, returned to England entirely restored to his former vigour. The king, shortly after his arrival, told him, that he had a son, who he was resolved should be educated like the son of a king, and that he could not choose a more proper man for his governor than Mr Wycherley; for which service \u00a3500 per annum should be settled upon him.\n\nImmediately after this offer he went to Tunbridge, where walking one day upon the Well's walk with his friend Mr Fairbeard, of Gray's Inn, just as he came up to the bookseller's shop, the countess of Drogheda, a young widow, rich, noble, and beautiful, came there to inquire for the Plain Dealer; \"Madam,\" says Mr Fairbeard, \"since you are for the Plain Dealer, there he is for you;\" pushing Mr Wycherley towards her. \"Yes,\" says Mr Wycherley, \"this lady can bear plain dealing; for she appears to be so accomplished, that what would be a compliment to others, would be plain dealing to her.\" \"No, truly, Sir,\" said the countess, \"I am not without my faults, any more than the rest of my sex; and yet notwithstanding, I love plain dealing, and am never more fond of it than when it tells me of them.\" \"Then, madam,\" says Mr Fairbeard, \"you and the Plain Dealer seem designed by Heaven for each other.\"\n\nIn short, Mr Wycherley walked a turn or two with the countess, waited upon her home, visited her daily while she staid at Tunbridge, and married her soon after without acquainting the king. By this step, which was looked upon as a contempt of his majesty's orders, he forfeited the royal favour. The countess of Drogheda settled her whole fortune upon him; but his title being disputed after her death, he was so reduced by the expenses of the law and other incumbrances, as to be unable to satisfy the impatience of his creditors, who threw him into prison; and the bookseller who printed his Plain Dealer, by which he got almost as much money as the other gained reputation, was so ungrateful as to refuse to lend him \u00a3200, in his extreme necessity. In that confinement he languished seven years; but at length King James going to see the above play, was so charmed with it, that he gave immediate orders for the payment of his debts, and even granted him a pension of \u00a3500 per annum. But the prince's bountiful intentions were a great measure defeated merely through Mr Wycherley's modesty; he being ashamed to tell the earl of Mulgrave, whom the king had sent to demand it, a true state of his debts. He laboured under the weight of these difficulties till his father died, who left him \u00a3600 a-year. But this estate was under limitations, he being only a tenant for life, and not being allowed to raise any money for the payment of his debts. However, he took a method of doing it which few suspected to be his choice; and this was making a jointure. He had often declared, that he was resolved to die married, though he could not bear the thoughts of living in that state again: accordingly, just at the eve of his death, he married a young gentlewoman with \u00a35000 fortune, part of which he applied to the uses he wanted it for. Eleven days after the celebration of these nuptials, in December 1715, he died, and was interred in the vault of Covent-garden church.\n\nBesides his plays above mentioned, he published a volume of poems in folio. In 1728 his posthumous works in prose and verse were published by Mr Theobald.","sp":459,"ep":459},{"h":"WYE","t":"a river of South Wales, which issuing out of Plinlymon Hill, very near the source of the Severn, crosses the north-east corner of Radnorshire, giving name to the town of Rhaydergowy (Fall of the Wye), where it is precipitated in a cataract: then flowing between this county and Brecknockshire, it crosses Herefordshire, and dividing the counties of Gloucester and Monmouthshire, falls into the mouth of the Severn, below Chepstow.

It is furnished with a strong prow: and the extremity of the stern, which is nothing more than a sort of railed platform or gallery, projects farther behind the counter and buttock than that of any European ship.\n\nBeing generally equipped as a corsair, the xebec is constructed with a narrow floor, to be more swift in pursuit of the enemy; and of a great breadth, to enable her to carry a greater force of sail for this purpose without danger of overturning. As these vessels are usually very low built, their decks are formed with a great convexity from the middle of their breadth towards the sides, in order to carry off the water which falls aboard more readily by their scuppers. But as this extreme convexity would render it very difficult to walk thereon at sea, particularly when the vessel rocks by the agitation of the waves, there is a platform of grating extending along the deck from the sides of the vessel towards the middle, whereon the crew may walk dry-footed whilst the water is conveyed through the grating to the scuppers.\n\nThe xebecs, which are generally armed as vessels of war by the Algerines, mount from 16 to 24 cannon, and carry from 300 to 450 men, two-thirds of whom are generally soldiers.\n\nBy the very complicated and inconvenient method of working these vessels, what one of their captains of Algiers told Mr Falconer will be readily believed, viz. that every xebec requires at least the labour of three square-rigged ships, wherein the standing sails are calculated to answer every situation of the wind.","sp":460,"ep":460},{"h":"XENOCRATES","t":"a celebrated ancient Grecian philosopher, was born at Chalcodon in the 95th Olympiad. At first he attached himself to Alcinus, but afterwards became a disciple of Plato, who took much pains in cultivating his genius, which was naturally heavy. His temper was gloomy, his aspect severe, and his manners little inclined with humanity. These material defects his master took great pains to correct; frequently advising him to sacrifice to the Graces: and the pupil was patient of instruction, and knew how to value the kindness of his preceptor. As long as Plato lived, Xenocrates was one of his most esteemed disciples; after his death he closely adhered to his doctrine; and, in the second year of the 110th Olympiad, he took the chair in the academy, as the successor of Speusippus.\n\nXenocrates was celebrated among the Athenians, not only for his wisdom, but for his virtues. So eminent was his reputation for integrity, that when he was called upon to give evidence in a judicial transaction, in which an oath was usually required, the judges unanimously agreed, that his simple affirmation should be taken, as a public testimony to his merit. Even Philip of Macedon found it impossible to corrupt him. So abstemious was he with respect to food, that his provision was frequently spoiled before it was consumed. His chastity was invincible. Phryne, a celebrated Athenian courtezan, attempted without success to seduce him. Of his humanity the following pathetic incident is a sufficient proof: A sparrow, which was pursued by a hawk, flew into his bosom; he afforded it protection till its enemy was out of sight, and then let it go, saying, that he would never betray a suppliant. He was fond of retirement, and was seldom seen in the city. He was discreet in the use of his time, and carefully allotted a certain portion of each day to study.\nXenocrates day to its proper business. One of these he employed in silent meditation. He was an admirer of the mathematical sciences; and was so fully convinced of their utility, that when a young man, who was unacquainted with geometry and astronomy, desired admission into the academy, he refused his request, saying, that he was not yet possessed of the handles of philosophy. In fine, Xenocrates was eminent both for the purity of his morals and for his acquaintance with science, and supported the credit of the Platonic school, by his lectures, his writings, and his conduct. He lived to the first year of the 116th Olympiad, or the 82 of his age, when he lost his life by accidentally falling, in the dark, into a reservoir of water.","sp":460,"ep":461},{"h":"XENOPHANES","t":"the founder of the Eleatic sect of philosophy among the Greeks, was born at Colophon probably about the 65th Olympiad. From some cause or other he left his country early, and took refuge in Sicily, where he supported himself by reciting, in the court of Hiero, elegiac and iambic verses, which he had written in imitation of the theogonies of Hesiod and Homer. From Sicily he passed over into Magna Graecia, where he took up the profession of philosophy, and became a celebrated preceptor in the Pythagorean school. Indulging, however, a greater freedom of thought than was usual among the disciples of Pythagoras, he ventured to introduce new opinions of his own, and in many particulars to oppose the doctrines of Epimenides, Thales, and Pythagoras. Xenophanes possessed the Pythagorean chair of philosophy about seventy years, and lived to the extreme age of a hundred years, that is, according to Eudoxus, till the 81st Olympiad. The doctrine of Xenophanes concerning nature is so imperfectly preserved, and obscurely expressed, that it is no wonder that it has been differently represented by different writers. Perhaps the truth is, that he held the universe to be one in nature and substance, but distinguished in his conception between the matter of which all things consist, and that latent divine force which, though not a distinct substance but an attribute, is necessarily inherent in the universe, and is the cause of all its perfection.","sp":461,"ep":461},{"h":"XENOPHON","t":"an illustrious philosopher, general, and historian, was born at Athens in the 3d year of the 82d Olympiad. When he was a youth, Socrates, struck with his external appearance, determined to admit him into the number of his pupils. Meeting him by accident in a narrow passage, the philosopher put his staff across the path, and stopping him, asked, where those things were to be purchased which are necessary to human life? Xenophon appearing at a loss for a reply to this unexpected salutation, Socrates proceeded to ask him, where honest and good men were to be found? Xenophon still hesitating, Socrates said to him, \"Follow me, and learn.\" From that time Xenophon became a disciple of Socrates, and made a rapid progress in that moral wisdom for which his master was so eminent. Xenophon accompanied Socrates in the Peloponnesian war, and fought courageously in defence of his country. He afterwards entered into the army of Cyrus as a private volunteer in his expedition against his brother. This enterprise proving unfortunate, Xenophon, after the death of Cyrus, advised his fellow soldiers to attempt a retreat into their own country. They listened to his advice; and having had many proofs of his wisdom as well as courage, they gave him the command of the army, in the room of Proxenus who had fallen in battle. In this command he acquired great glory by the prudence and firmness with which he conducted them back, through the midst of innumerable dangers, into their own country. The particulars of this memorable adventure are related by Xenophon himself in his Retreat of the Ten Thousand. After his return into Greece, he joined Agesilaus, king of Sparta, and fought with him against the Thebans in the celebrated battle of Charonea. The Athenians, displeased at this alliance, brought a public accusation against him for his former conduct in engaging in the service of Cyrus, and condemned him to exile. The Spartans, upon this, took Xenophon, as an injured man, under their protection, and provided him a comfortable retreat at Scilluntes in Elea. Here, with his wife and two children, he remained several years, and passed his time in the society of his friends, and in writing those historical works which have rendered his name immortal. A war at length arose between the Spartans and Eleans; and Xenophon was obliged to retire to Lepreus, where his eldest son had settled. He afterwards removed, with his whole family, to Corinth, where, in the first year of the hundred and fifth Olympiad, he finished his days.\n\nXENOPHON the Younger, a Greek writer, so called to distinguish him from the celebrated Xenophon, was born at Ephesus, and lived, according to some authors, before Heliodorus, that is, about the beginning of the 4th century.

The fleet that attended this prodigious land force is likewise made to consist of 2000 sail; and all the succours they met with was the taking and burning the city of Athens; for the army was shamefully repulsed near the straits of Thermopylae by Leonidas, and the fleet was dispersed and partly destroyed by Themistocles at the straits of Salamis, who had only 380 sail under his command.

He then went to Rome; and being robbed on the road, brought nothing back but a bull for obtaining the first vacant prebend: but the archbishop of Toledo refused it him, and threw him into prison. Being at length restored to liberty, he obtained a benefice in the diocese of Siguenza, where Cardinal Gonzales de Mendoza, who was the bishop, made him his grand vicar. Ximenes some time after entered among the Franciscans of Toledo; but being there troubled with visits, he retired to a solitude named Ca\u00f1uelo, and applied himself to the study of divinity and the oriental tongues. At his return to Toledo, Queen Isabella of Castile chose him for her confessor, and afterwards nominated him archbishop of Toledo; which, next to the papacy, is the richest dignity in the church of Rome. \"This honour (says Dr Robertson) he declined with a firmness...\"\nfirmness which nothing but the authoritative injunction of the pope was able to overcome. Nor did this height of promotion change his manners. Though obliged to display in public that magnificence which became his station, he himself retained his monastic severity. Under his pontifical robes he constantly wore the coarse frock of St Francis, the rents of which he used to patch with his own hands. He at no time used linen, but was commonly clad in hair-cloth. He slept always in his habit; most frequently on the floor or on boards, and rarely in a bed. He did not taste any of the delicacies which appeared at his table, but satisfied himself with that simple diet which the rule of his order prescribed. Notwithstanding these peculiarities, so opposite to the manners of the world, he possessed a thorough knowledge of its affairs, and discovered talents for business which rendered the fame of his wisdom equal to that of his sanctity.\" His first care was to provide for the necessities of the poor; to visit the churches and hospitals; to purge his diocese of usurers and places of debauchery; to degrade corrupt judges, and place in their rooms persons whom he knew to be distinguished by their probity and disinterestedness. He erected a famous university at Alcal\u00e1; and in 1499 founded the college of St Ildefonso. Three years after he undertook the Polyglot Bible; and for that purpose sent for many learned men to come to him at Toledo, purchased seven copies in Hebrew for 4000 crowns, and gave a great price for Latin and Greek manuscripts. At this Bible they laboured above 12 years. It contains the Hebrew text of the Bible; the version of the Septuagint, with a literal translation; that of St Jerome, and the Chaldee paraphrases of Onkelos; and Ximenes added to it a dictionary of the Hebrew and Chaldee words contained in the Bible. This work is called Ximenes's Polyglot. In 1507 Pope Julius II. gave him the cardinal's hat, and King Ferdinand the Catholic entrusted him with the administration of affairs. Cardinal Ximenes was from this moment the soul of every thing that passed in Spain. He distinguished himself at the beginning of his ministry by discharging the people from the burdensome tax called acavado, which had been continued on account of the war against Granada; and laboured with such zeal and success in the conversion of the Mahometans, that he made 3000 converts, among whom was a prince of the blood of the kings of Granada. In 1509 Cardinal Ximenes extended the dominions of Ferdinand, by taking the city of Oran in the kingdom of Algiers. He undertook this conquest at his own expense, and marched in person at the head of the Spanish army clothed in his pontifical ornaments, and accompanied by a great number of ecclesiastics and monks. Some time after, foreseeing an extraordinary scarcity, he erected public granaries at Toledo, Alcal\u00e1, and Torrelaguna, and had them filled with corn at his own expense; which gained the people's hearts to such a degree, that to preserve the memory of this noble action they had an eulogium upon it cut on marble, in the hall of the senate-house at Toledo, and in the marketplace. King Ferdinand dying in 1516, left Cardinal Ximenes regent of his dominions; and the archduke Charles, who was afterwards the emperor Charles V., confirmed that nomination. The cardinal immediately made a reform of the officers of the supreme council and of the court, and put a stop to the oppression of the grandees. He vindicated the rights of the people against the nobility; and as by the feudal constitution the military power was lodged in the hands of the nobles, and men of inferior condition were called into the field only as their vassals, a king with scanty revenues depended on them in all his operations. From this state Ximenes resolved to deliver the crown; and issued a proclamation, commanding every city in Castile to enrol a certain number of its burgesses, and teach them military discipline; he himself engaging to provide officers to command them at the public expense. This was vigorously opposed by the nobles; but by his intrepidity and superior address he carried his point. He then endeavoured to diminish the possessions of the nobility, by reclaiming all the crown-lands, and putting a stop to the pensions granted by the late king Ferdinand. This addition made to the revenues enabled him to discharge all the debts of Ferdinand, and to establish magazines of warlike stores. The nobles, alarmed at these repeated attacks, uttered loud complaints; but before they proceeded to extremities, appointed some grandees of the first rank to examine the powers in consequence of which he exercised acts of such high authority. Ximenes received them with cold civility; produced the testament of Ferdinand, by which he was appointed regent, together with the ratification of that deed by Charles. To both these they objected; and he endeavoured to establish their validity. As the conversation grew warm, he led them insensibly to a balcony, from which they had a view of a large body of troops under arms, and of a formidable train of artillery. \"Behold (says he, pointing to these, and raising his voice) the powers which I have received from his Catholic majesty! With these I govern Castile; and with these I will govern it, till the king, your master and mine, takes possession of his kingdom!\" A declaration so bold and haughty silenced them, and affronted their associates. They saw that he was prepared for his defence, and laid aside all thoughts of a general confederacy against his administration. At length, from the repeated intreates of Ximenes, and the impatient murmurs of the Spanish ministry, Charles V. embarked, and landed in Spain, accompanied by his favourites. Ximenes was advancing to the coast to meet him, but at Bos L\u00e9quillo was seized with a violent disorder, which his followers considered as the effects of poison. This accident obliging Ximenes to stop, he wrote to the king, and with his usual boldness advised him to dismiss all the strangers in his train, whose number and credit already gave offence to the Spaniards, and earnestly desired to have an interview with him, that he might inform him of the state of the nation, and the temper of his subjects. To prevent this, not only the Flemings, but the Spanish grandees, employed all their addresses to keep Charles at a distance from Aranda, the place to which the cardinal had removed. His advice was now flouted and despised. Ximenes, conscious of his own integrity and merit, expected a more grateful return from a prince to whom he delivered a kingdom more flourishing than it had been in any former age, and a more extensive authority than the most illustrious of his ancestors had ever possessed; and lamented the fate of his country, about to be ruined by the rapaciousness and insolence of foreign favourites. While his mind was agitated by these passions, he received a letter from the king; in which, after a few\nXimenes cold and formal expressions of regard, he was allowed to retire to his diocese; and he expired a few hours after reading it in 1517, in the 81st year of his age.\n\nThis famous cardinal ought not to be confounded with Roderic Ximenes, archbishop of Toledo, in the 13th century, who wrote a History of Spain in nine books; nor with several other Spanish writers of the name of Ximenes.\n\nXiphias, the Sword-Fish; a genus of fishes belonging to the order of apod\u00e6. See Ichthyology Index. This fish is common in the Mediterranean sea, especially in that part which separates Italy from Sicily, and which has been long celebrated for it: the promontory Pelorus, now Capo di Faro, was a place noted for the resort of the xiphias, or possibly the station of the speculators, or the persons who watched and gave notice of the approach of the fish.\n\nThe ancient method of taking them is particularly described by Strabo, and agrees exactly with that practised by the moderns. A man ascends one of the cliffs that overhangs the sea; as soon as he spies the fish, he gives notice, either by his voice or by signs, of the course it takes. Another that is stationed in a boat, climbs up the mast, and on seeing the sword-fish, directs the rowers towards it. As soon as they think they are got within reach, he descends, and taking a spear in his hand, strikes it into the fish; which, after wearing itself with its agitation, is seized and drawn into the boat. It is much esteemed by the Sicilians, who buy it up eagerly, and at its first coming into season give it about sixpence English per pound. The season lasts from May till August. The ancients used to cut this fish into pieces and salt it; whence it was called Tomus Thurianus, from Thurii, a town in the bay of Tarentum, where it was taken and cured.\n\nThe sword-fish is said to be very voracious, and that it is a great enemy to the tunny, which (according to Belon) are as much terrified at it as sheep are at the sight of a wolf. It is a great enemy to whales, and frequently destroys them.","sp":461,"ep":463},{"h":"XYLO-ALOES","t":"or Aloe wood, in the Materia Medica, is the product of a tree growing in China and some of the Indian islands. See Exocaria.\n\nThis drug is distinguished into three sorts; the calambac or tambac, the common lignum aloes, and calambour.\n\nThe calambac, or finest aloes wood, called by authors lignum aloes praeflantissimum, and by the Chinese fak-hiang, is the most resinous of all the woods we are acquainted with: it is of a light spongy texture, very porous, and its pores so filled up with a soft and fragrant resin, that the whole may be pressed and dented by the fingers like wax, or moulded about by chewing in the mouth, in the manner of mastic. This kind, laid on the fire, melts in great parts like resin, and burns away in a few moments with a bright flame and perfumed smell. Its scent, while in the mass, is very fragrant and agreeable; and its taste acid and bitterish, but very aromatic and agreeable. It is so variable in its colour, that some have divided it into three kinds; the one variegated with black and purple; the second, with the same black, but with yellowish instead of purple; and the third, yellow alone like the yolk of an egg: this last is the least scented of the three. The variation, however, is owing to the trunk of the tree being itself of three different colours; and the heart of it is the valuable part first described. The two following are supposed to be the other parts of the trunk; though this seems doubtful, especially in regard to the last sort, from the circumstance mentioned of its being found in large logs entire, and sometimes only the heart, which, as above noticed, constitutes the calambac.\n\nThe lignum aloes vulgare is the second in value. This is of a more dense and compact texture, and consequently less resinous than the other; there is some of it, however, that is spongy, and has the holes filled up with the right resinous matter; and all of it, when good, has veins of the same resin in it. We meet with it in small fragments, which have been cut and split from larger: these are of a tolerably dense texture in the more solid pieces, and of a dusky brown colour, variegated with resinous black veins. It is in this state very heavy, and less fragrant than those pieces which show a multitude of little holes, filled up with the same blackish matter that forms the veins in others. The woody part of these last pieces is somewhat darker than the other, and is not unfrequently purplish, or even blackish. The smell of the common aloe wood is very agreeable, but not so strongly perfumed as the former. Its taste is somewhat bitter and acrid, but very aromatic.\n\nThe calambour, called also agallochum sylvestre, and lignum aloes mexicanum, is light and friable, of a dusky and often mottled colour, between a dusky green black and a deep brown. Its smell is fragrant and agreeable, but much less sweet than that of either of the others; and its taste bitterish, but not so much acid or aromatic as either of the two former. This is said to be met with very frequently, and in large logs; and these sometimes entire, sometimes only the heart of the tree. This is the aloe wood used by the cabinet-makers and inlayers.\n\nThis drug is esteemed a cordial taken inwardly; and is sometimes given in disorders of the stomach and bowels, and to destroy the worms. A very fragrant oil may be procured from it by distillation; which is recommended in paralytic cases from five to fifteen drops.

See Achill\u00e6a, Botany Index.\n\nYawning, an involuntary opening of the mouth, generally produced by weariness or an inclination to sleep. Yawning, according to Boerhaave, is performed by expanding at once and the same time all the muscles capable of spontaneous motion; by greatly extending the lungs; by drawing in gradually and slowly a large quantity of air; and gradually and slowly breathing it out, after it has been retained for some time and rarefied; and then restoring the muscles to their natural state. Hence the effect of yawning is to move, accelerate, and equally distribute all the humours through all the vessels of the body, and consequently to qualify Yawning, the muscles and organs of sensation for their various functions.\n\nSanctorius observes, that a great deal is insensibly discharged, when nature endeavours to get rid of the retained perspirable matter, by yawning and stretching of the limbs. To these a person is most inclined just after sleep, because a greater quantity going off by the pores of the skin than at other times, whenever a person wakes, the increasing contraction that then happens closes a great deal of the perspirable matter in the cutaneous passages, which will continually give such irritations as excite yawning and stretching; and such motions, by shaking the membranes of the whole body, and shifting the contacts of their fibres, and the inclosed matter, by degrees throw it off. Hence we see the reason why healthful strong people are most inclined to such motions, because they perspire most in time of sleep, and therefore have more of the perspirable matter to lodge in the pores, and greater irritations thereunto. The advantages of some little exercise just after waking in a morning are considerable, as it throws off all the perspirable matter that is ready for its exit out of the body. When yawning is troublesome, Hippocrates says that long deep respiration or drawing in the air at long intervals cures it.","sp":465,"ep":465},{"h":"YEAR","t":"in Astronomy and Chronology.

The best account that we have of it is by Mr Cavendish, in the Phil. Trans. of the Royal Society of London for the year 1792. \"Before I speak of the civil year of the Hindoos (says this eminent philosopher), it will be proper to say a few words of the astronomical year, by which it is regulated.\n\n\"The astronomical year begins at the instant when the sun comes to the first point of the Hindoo zodiac. In the year 1792, it began on April 9th, at 22h. 14' after midnight of their first meridian, which is about 41' of time west of Calcutta; but, according to Mr Gentil's account of the Indian astronomy, it began 3h. 24' earlier. As this year, however, is longer than ours, its commencement falls continually later, in respect of the Julian year, by 50' 26\" in four years. This year is divided into 12 months, each of which corresponds to the time of the sun's stay in some sign; so that they are of different lengths, and seldom begin at the beginning of a day.\n\n\"The civil day in all parts of India begins at sunrise, and is divided into 60 parts called dandas, which are again divided into 60 palas. In those parts of India in which the Benares almanac, or as it is there called patras, is used, the civil year is lunifolar, consisting of 12 lunar months, with an intercalary month inserted between them occasionally. It begins at the day after the new moon next before the beginning of the solar year. The lunar month is divided into 30 parts called teethee; these are not strictly of the same length, but are equal to the time in which the moon's true motion from the sun is 12\u00b0. From the new moon till the moon arrives at 12\u00b0 distance from the sun is called the first teethee; from thence till it comes to 24\u00b0, is called the second teethee; and so on till the full moon, after which the teethees return in the same order as before.\n\n\"The civil day is constantly called by the number of that teethee which expires during the course of the day; and as the teethee is sometimes longer than one day, a day sometimes occurs in which no teethee ends. When this is the case, the day is called by the same number as the following day; so that two successive days go by the same name. It oftener happens, however, that two teethees end on the same day; in which case the number of the first of them gives name to the day, and there is no day called by the number of the last, so that a gap is made in the order of the days. In the latter part of the month the days are counted from the full moon, in the same manner as in the former part they are counted from the new moon; only the last day, or that on which the new moon happens, is called the 30th, instead of the 1st. It appears, therefore, that each half of the month constantly begins on the day after that on which the new or full moon falls; only sometimes the half month begins with the second day, the first being wanting.\n\n\"This manner of counting the days is sufficiently intricate; but that of counting the months is still more so.\n\n\"The civil year, as was before said, begins at the day after the new moon; and, moreover, in the years which have an intercalary month, this month begins at the day after the new moon; but notwithstanding this, the ordinary civil month begins at the day after the full moon. To make their method more intelligible, we will call the time from new moon to new moon the natural month. The civil month Vilaika, the first in the Hindoo kalender, which extends from the 9th of our April to the 10th of May, begins at the day after that full moon which is nearest to the instant at which the sun enters Melha, the first in order of the Indian signs, whether before or after; however, it is not always accurately the nearest.\n\n\"A consequence of this way of counting the months is, that the first half of Chitra, the last month in the Indian kalender, extending from March the 10th to April the 9th, falls in one year, and the latter half in the following year; and whenever the sun enters no sign during a natural month, this month is intercalary. The number of days in the month varies from 29 to 32. Indeed the Hindoo months, both solar and lunar, consist neither of a determinate number of days, nor are regulated by any cycle, but depend solely on the motions of the sun and moon; so that a Hindoo has no way of knowing what day of the month it is but by consulting his almanac; and what is more, the month ought sometimes to begin on different days, in different places, on account of the difference in latitude and longitude, not to mention the difference which may arise from errors in computation. This mode of computing time must be attended with many inconveniences; but in the transactions of civil life the Hindoos do not much regard it. A disagreement, however, in the computation of the teethee, which sometimes also happens, occasions no small perplexity; because by the teethees or lunar days are regulated most of their religious festivals. Every Brahmin in charge of a temple, or whose duty it is to announce the times for the observance of religious ceremonies, is therefore furnished with one of their almanacs; and if he be an astronomer, he makes such corrections in it as the difference of latitude and longitude renders necessary.\"\n\nNew Year's Gift.

See Brewing.\n\nIt is used for a leaven or ferment in the baking of bread, as serving to swell or puff it up very considerably.\nYeast in a little time, and to make it much lighter, softer, and more delicate. See Baking, Barn, and Bread.\n\nMr Henry has published a method of preparing artificial yeast, by which good bread may be made without the affluence of any other ferment. The method is this: Boil flour and water together to the consistence of treacle, and when the mixture is cold saturate it with fixed air. Pour the mixture thus saturated into one or more large bottles or narrow-mouthed jars; cover it over loofely with paper, and upon that lay a plate or board with a weight to keep it steady. Place the vessel in a situation where the thermometer will stand from 70\u00b0 to 80\u00b0, and stir up the mixture two or three times in 24 hours. In about two days such a degree of fermentation will have taken place, as to give the mixture the appearance of yeast. With the yeast in this state, and before it has acquired a thoroughly vinous smell, mix the quantity of flour intended for bread, in the proportion of five pounds of flour to a quart of the yeast, and a sufficient portion of warm water. Knead them well together in a proper vessel, and covering it with a cloth, let the dough stand for 12 hours, or till it appears to be sufficiently fermented in the fore-mentioned degree of warmth. It is then to be formed into loaves and baked. Mr Henry adds, that perhaps the yeast would be more perfect, if a decoction of malt were used instead of simple water.\n\nIt has lately been discovered, that a decoction of malt alone, without any addition, will produce a yeast proper enough for the purpose of brewing. This discovery was made by Joseph Senyor, servant of the reverend Mr Malon of Alton near Rotherham; and he received for it a reward of \u00a320. from the Society for promoting Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce. The process is as follows: Procure three earthen or wooden vessels of different sizes and apertures, one capable of holding two quarts, the other three or four, and the third five or six: boil a quarter of a peck of malt for about eight or ten minutes in three pints of water; and when a quart is poured off from the grains, let it stand in the first or smaller vessel in a cool place till not quite cold, but retaining that degree of heat which the brewers usually find to be proper when they begin to work their liquor. Then remove the vessel into some warm situation near a fire, where the thermometer stands between 70\u00b0 and 80\u00b0 degrees Fahrenheit, and there let it remain till the fermentation begins, which will be plainly perceived within 30 hours: add then two quarts more of a like decoction of malt, when cool, as the first was; and mix the whole in the second or larger vessel, and stir it well in, which must be repeated in the usual way, as it rises in a common vat: then add a still greater quantity of the same decoction, to be worked in the largest vessel, which will produce yeast enough for a brewing of 40 gallons.\n\nCommon ale yeast may be kept fresh and fit for use several months by the following method: Put a quantity of it into a close canvas bag, and gently squeeze out the moisture in a screw-press till the remaining matter be as firm and stiff as clay. In this state it may be closely packed up in a tight cask for securing it from the air; and will keep fresh, sound, and fit for use, for a long time. This is a secret that might be of great use to the brewers and distillers, who, though they employ very large quantities of yeast, seem to know no method of preserving it, or raising nurseries of it; for want of which they sustain a very considerable loss; whereas the brewers in Flanders make a very great advantage of supplying the malt distillers of Holland with yeast, which is rendered lasting and fit for carriage by this easy expedient.","sp":466,"ep":467},{"h":"YELL","t":"one of the islands of Shetland, lying northeast from the Mainland, and divided from it by an arm of the sea, called Yell-Sound.

This city is so ancient that the origin of it is uncertain. In the time of the Romans a legion was stationed here, it being then the capital of the Brigantes; and here died the emperor Severus, and Flavius Valerius Constantius Chlorus, father of Constantine the Great. There was then also a temple of Bellona here, and no less than three military ways went from hence. In the time of the Saxons it was erected into an archbishopric by Pope Honorius, to which are now subject the bishoprics of Chester, Durham, Carlisle, and the isle of Man; though anciently 12 bishoprics in England, and all Scotland, were. A horn is still kept in the minster, by which Ulphius, one of the Saxon princes, bestowed all his lands and revenues upon the church.\n\nThis city suffered very much during the ravages of the Danes; but, after the Conquest, it began to flourish again. The cathedral, which cost a long time and a great deal of money in building, is a most stately Gothic pile. Its chapter-house is particularly admired for its painted glass, its fine marble stalls, its pillars of alabaster, and curious contrivance. In it is the following line in gold letters:\n\nUt Roja, flore florum, fic est Domus ista Domorum.\n\nThe choir is remarkable for its fine carvings, particularly the statues of all the English monarchs; and the windows are exquisitely painted with the history of the Bible. The lantorn steeple is 70 feet square, and 188 high, and the windows are 45. At the south end is a circular light, called the marigold window from the colour of its glass; and at the north end is a very large one, whose painting represents embroidery.\n\nThis city is generally reckoned the second city in England; but though it stands upon more ground, it is inferior in trade, wealth, and number of people, to Bristol. The inhabitants are reckoned at 16,145. It is situated in a fine plain, in the middle of the shire, on both sides the Ouse, walled and divided into four wards, containing 28 parishes. It enjoys large privileges and immunities, conferred upon it by a succession of kings from Henry II. and its chief magistrate has the title of lord mayor, which is an honour peculiar to it and London. Richard II. made it a county of itself. The conservancy of most of the rivers of the county, within certain limits, belongs to the lord mayor and aldermen. The middle arch of the bridge here over the Ouse is thought to equal the Rialto at Venice in architecture, height, and breadth, the diameter being 81 feet, and the height 31. Though this city is 60 miles distant from the sea, yet ships of 70 tons burden come up the river to it. The town-house or guild-hall stands upon the bridge, and is superior in all respects to that of London. In the Popish times there were nine abbeys here, and a vast number of churches; but of the latter there are only 17 now. The steeple of that of Allhallows is reckoned the finest in England. The archbishop has a fine palace; and the assembly-room, designed by the earl of Burlington, is very noble. Here are plays, assemblies, concerts, and the like entertainments, at some house or other, almost every night in the week. In the old castle, built originally by William the Conqueror, and repaired in 1701, the assizes are kept. It serves also for the county-gaol, which is the neatest and pleasantest in England, with an area larger than that of the King's-bench, and it has a handsome chapel in it, with a good allowance for a preacher. This city has long given the title of duke to some branch of the royal family.\n\nThe plenty and cheapness of provisions induces many persons of small fortune, or that would live frugally, to take up their abode here; and the venerable remains of Roman antiquities, and those of a later date, as abbeys, churches, and castles, procure this city a visit from every curious traveller. Many Roman altars, urns, coins, inscriptions, &c., have been found; and Saxon coins are still extant that have been struck here. The members, being two in number, for this city, have precedence of all others, except those of London, in the house of commons. An infirmary, after the manner of those of Bath, Bristol, &c., hath been erected in it; and a cotton manufacture established and brought to great perfection. Besides four weekly markets, it has a great many fairs; one, in particular, every other Thursday for cattle and sheep. W. Long. i. i. N.

Its area is computed by some at 4684 square miles, by others at 3,770,000 acres, and its inhabitants at 878,892. It is divided into three parts or ridings, viz. the West, East, and North; so denominated from their situation, in respect of the city of York. Each of these is as large, if not larger, than any ordinary county. There are other divisions, as Richmondshire, Allertonshire, Howdenshire, Hallamshire, Craven, Cleveland, Marshland, Holderness, &c.\n\nAs the soil and face of the country vary greatly, so does the air. In the hilly parts the air is good, but the soil very indifferent; of the lower form are marshy, others drier, and the soil of both rich; but the air of the former\nYork. former is more foggy and unhealthy than that of the latter. The manufactures of this county are cutlery and hard-wares; particularly knives, bits, and spurs; but the principal are stockings and woollen cloth, with which it supplies in a great measure Germany and the North. As to the produce, it abounds in corn, cattle, horses, lead, and iron, coal, wood, lime, liquorice, alum, jet, &c. It lies wholly in the northern circuit, and much the greater part of it in the diocese of York; that only which is called Richmondshire belonging to the diocese of Chester. The members it sends to parliament are 30; of which two are for the shire and 28 for the towns.\n\nNew-York, one of the United States of America, is bounded towards the south-east by the Atlantic ocean; east by Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont; north by the 45th degree of latitude, which divides it from Canada; north-westwardly by the river Iroquois or St Lawrence, and the lakes Ontario and Erie; south-west and south by Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The whole state contains about 44,000 square miles, equal to 28,163,000 acres.\n\nThe settlements already made in this state are chiefly upon two narrow oblongs, extending from the city of New York east and north. The one east is Long island, which is 140 miles long, and narrow, and surrounded by the sea. The one extending north is about 40 miles in breadth, and bisected by Hudson's river. And such is the intersection of the whole state by the branches of the Hudson, the Delaware, the Susquehannah, and other large rivers, that there are few places throughout its whole extent which are more than 15 or 20 miles from some navigable stream. There are few fish in the rivers, but in the brooks are plenty of trout; and in the lakes yellow perch, sun-fish, salmon-trout, cat-fish, and a variety of others.\n\nThe State, to speak generally, abounds with lakes, some of salt and others of fresh water. It is intersected by ridges of mountains running in a north-east and south-west direction. Beyond the Alleghany mountains, however, the country is a dead level, of a fine rich soil, covered, in its natural state, with maple, beech, birch, cherry, black-walnut, locust, hickory, and some mulberry trees. On the banks of lake Erie are a few chestnut and oak ridges. Hemlock swamps are interspersed thinly through the country. All the creeks that empty into lake Erie have falls, which afford many excellent mill seats. East of the Alleghany mountains, the country is broken into hills with rich intervening valleys. The hills are clothed thick with timber, and when cleared afford fine pasture; the valleys, when cultivated, produce wheat, hemp, flax, peas, grapes, oats, Indian corn. Of the commodities produced from culture, wheat is the staple; of which immense quantities are raised and exported. Indian corn and peas are likewise raised for exportation; and rye, oats, barley, &c., for home consumption. In some parts of the State excellent dairies are kept, which furnish for the market butter and cheese.\n\nThe situation of New-York, with respect to foreign markets, has decidedly the preference to any other of the United States. It has at all seasons of the year a short and easy access to the ocean. Its exports to the West Indies are, biscuit, peas, Indian corn apples, onions, boards, flaxes, horses, sheep, butter, cheese, pickled oysters, beef, and pork. But wheat is the staple commodity of the State, of which no less than 677,700 bushels were exported in the year 1775, besides 255 tons of bread and 2828 tons of flour. Inspectors of flour are appointed to prevent imposition, and to see that none is exported but that which is deemed by them merchantable. Besides the above-mentioned articles, are exported flax-seed, cotton, wool, sarsaparilla, coffee, indigo, rice, pig-iron, bar-iron, pot-ash, pearl-ash, furs, deer-skins, logwood, futick, mahogany, bees wax, oil, Madeira wine, rum, tar, pitch, turpentine, whale-fins, fish, sugars, molasses, salt, tobacco, lard, &c., but most of these articles are imported for re-exportation. In the year 1774, there were employed, in the trade of this State, 1075 vessels, whose tonnage amounted to 40,812.\n\nSince the revolution, the literature of the State has engaged the attention of the legislature. In one of their earliest sessions an act passed, constituting 21 gentlemen (of whom the governor and lieutenant-governor for the time being are members ex officio) a body corporate and politic, by the name and style of \"The regents of the university of the State of New-York.\" They are intrusted with the care of literature in general in the State, and have power to grant charters of incorporation for erecting colleges and academies throughout the state\u2014are to visit these institutions as often as they shall think proper, and report their state to the legislature once a-year. All degrees above that of master of arts are to be conferred by the regents. A universal toleration is granted in religion.\n\nThe supreme legislative powers of the State are vested in two branches, a senate and assembly. The members of the senate are elected by the freeholders of the State, who possess freehold estates to the value of 100l. clear of debts. For the purpose of electing senators, the State is divided into four great districts, each of which chooses a certain number.\n\nThe assembly of the State is composed of representatives from the several counties, chosen annually in May. Every male inhabitant of full age, who has resided in the state six months preceding the day of election, and possessing a freehold to the value of 20l. in the county where he is to give his vote; or has rented a tenement therein of the yearly value of forty shillings, and has been rated and actually paid taxes\u2014is entitled to vote for representatives in assembly. The number of representatives is limited to 300.\n\nThe supreme executive power of the State is vested in a governor chosen once in three years by the freemen of the state. The lieutenant-governor is, by his office, president of the senate; and, upon an equal division of voices, has a casting vote; but has no voice on other occasions. The governor has not a seat in the legislature; but as a member of the council of revision and council of appointment, he has a vast influence in the state. The council of revision is composed of the chancellor, the judges of the supreme court, or any of them, and the governor. In the year 1790 the number of inhabitants in this state was 340,120, of whom 21,324 were negroes; but in 1795 the whole population of the state amounted to 530,177, making an increase of 190,057 in five years.\n\nNew-York, a city of North America, capital of the state of the same name. It is situated at the south-west point.\npoint of an island, at the confluence of Hudson and East rivers, and is about four miles in circumference. The situation is both healthy and pleasant. Surrounded on all sides by water, it is refreshed by cool breezes in summer, and the air in winter is more temperate than in other places under the same parallel. York island is 15 miles in length, and hardly one in breadth. It is joined to the main by a bridge called King's bridge. The channels between Long and Staten islands, and between Long and York islands, are so narrow as to occasion an unusual rapidity of the tides, which is increased by the confluence of the waters of Hudson and East rivers. This rapidity, in general, prevents the obstruction of the channel by ice. There is no harbor or bay for the reception of ships; but the road where they lie in East river is defended from the violence of the sea by the islands which interlock with each other; so that, except that of Rhode island, the harbour of New-York, which admits ships of any burden, is the best of the United States. The number of the inhabitants in 1786 was 23,614.\n\nThe most magnificent edifice in this city is Federal Hall, at the head of Broad-street; in a gallery in front of which General Washington, attended by the senate and house of representatives, took his oath of office at the commencement of the operation of the federal constitution, 30th April, 1789. The other public buildings in the city are, three houses for public worship for the Dutch Reformed church, four for Presbyterians, three for Episcopalians, two for German Lutherans and Calvinists, two for Quakers, two for Baptists, two for Methodists, one for Moravians, one for Catholics, one for French Protestants, and a Jewish synagogue.\n\nKing's college was chiefly founded by the voluntary contributions of the inhabitants of the province, assisted by the general assembly, and the corporation of Trinity Church; in the year 1754, a royal charter (and grant of money) being then obtained, incorporating a number of gentlemen therein mentioned, by the name of \"The Governors of the College of the Province of New-York, in the city of New-York, in America;\" granting to them the power of conferring all such degrees as are usually conferred by either of the English universities. The building consists of an elegant stone edifice, three stories high, with four staircases, 12 apartments in each, a chapel, hall, library, museum, anatomical theatre, and a school for experimental philosophy. It is situated on a dry gravelly soil, about 150 yards from the bank of Hudson's river, commanding a beautiful and extensive prospect. Since the revolution, the legislature passed an act constituting 21 gentlemen (of whom the governor and lieutenant-governor for the time being, are members ex officio) a body corporate and politic by the name of \"The Regents of the University of the State of New-York.\" They are entrusted with the care of literature in general, and have power to grant charters for erecting colleges and academies through the state. It is now denominated Columbia college. The annual revenue arising from the estate belonging to the college amounts to \u00a3335l. currency, exclusive of some bonds which are not as yet productive. It consists of a faculty of arts, and one of physic, the first having a president and seven professors, and the second a dean, and the same number of professors. The library and museum were destroyed during the war, after which upwards of \u00a3800l. were expended on books to enlarge the library.\n\nThe government of this city is at present in the hands of a mayor, aldermen, and common council, and the city is divided into seven wards, in each of which an alderman and assistant are annually chosen by the people. A court of session is held for the trial of criminal causes. It is esteemed the most eligible situation for commerce in the United States; but the want of good water is a great inconvenience, there being few wells in the city, and most of the people are supplied with fresh water conveyed to their doors in casks from the head of Queen street. The number of inhabitants in 1796 is stated at more than 33,000; and according to some it is supposed that they amount at this time to nearly the double. The entries from foreign ports in 1795, were 178 ships, 309 brigs, 9 barges, 7 snows, 268 schooners, and 170 sloops. Works of defense have been erected to a considerable extent, and when completed on the original plan, will afford great security to the city. New-York is 95 miles N. E. of Philadelphia, 197 N. E. of Baltimore, and 913 from Charleston. W. Long. 74\u00b0 9' 45\". N.

When sufficiently qualified, he was matriculated into All-Souls college, Oxford; and desirous to follow the civil law, he took a degree in that profession. In this situation he wrote his poem called The Last Day, published in 1704; which coming from a layman gave universal satisfaction: this was soon after followed by another, entitled The Force of Religion, or Vanquished Love. These productions gained him a respectable acquaintance; he was intimate with Addison, and thus became one of the writers of the Spectator; but the turn of his mind leading him to the church, he took orders, was made one of the king's chaplains, and obtained the living of Welwyn in Hertfordshire, worth about \u00a3500 per annum, but he never rose to higher preferment. For some years before the death of the late prince of Wales, Dr Young attended his court pretty constantly; but upon his decease all his hopes of church preferment vanished; however, upon the death of Dr Hales, he was taken into the service of the princess-dowager of Wales, and succeeded him as her privy chaplain. When pretty far advanced in life, he married the lady Elizabeth Lee, daughter of the late earl of Litchfield. This lady was a widow, and had an amiable son and daughter, who both died young. What he felt for their loss, as well as for that of his wife, is finely expressed in his Night Thoughts, in which the young lady is characterized under the name of Narcissa; her brother by that of Philander; and his wife, though nameless, is frequently mentioned; and he thus, in an apostrophe to death, deplores the loss of all the three.\n\nInfatiate archer, could not once suffice!\nThy shaft flew thrice, and thrice my peace was slain,\nAnd thrice ere thrice yon moon renew'd her horn.\n\nHe wrote three tragedies, The Revenge, Bufonis, and The Brothers. His satires, called Love of Fame the universal Passion, are by many esteemed his principal performance; though Swift said the poet should have been...\nYoung, been either more angry or more merry: they have been characterized as a string of epigrams written on one subject, that tire the reader before he gets through them. His Complaint, or Night Thoughts, exhibit him as a moral and melancholy poet, and are esteemed his masterpiece. They form a species of poetry peculiarly his own, and in which he has been unrivalled by all those who attempted to write in this manner. They were written under the recent pressure of his sorrow for the loss of his wife, daughter, and son-in-law; they are addressed to Lorenzo, a man of pleasure and the world, and who, as it is intimated by some, is his own son, but then labouring under his father's displeasure. As a prose-writer, he arraigned the prevailing manners of his time, in a work called The Centaur not Fabulous; and when he was above 80 years of age, published Conjectures on Original Composition. He published some pieces; and the whole of his works are collected in 4 and 5 vols 12mo. Dr Young's turn of mind was naturally solemn; and he usually, when at home in the country, spent many hours of the day walking in his own church-yard among the tombs. His conversation, his writings, had all a reference to the life after this; and this turn of disposition mixed itself even with his improvements in gardening. He had, for instance, an alcove with a bench, so painted, near his house, that at a distance it looked as a real one which the spectator was then approaching. Upon coming up near it, however, the deception was perceived, and this motto appeared, *Invisibilis non decipiant*, \"The things unseen do not deceive us.\" Yet, notwithstanding this gloominess of temper, he was fond of innocent sports and amusement: he instituted an assembly and a bowling-green in the parish of which he was rector, and often promoted the gaiety of the company in person. His wit was generally poignant, and ever levelled at those who testified any contempt for decency and religion. His epigram, spoken extempore on Voltaire, is well known; who happening in his company to ridicule Milton, and the allegorical personages of Death and Sin, Young thus addressed him:\n\nThou art so witty, profligate, and thin,\nYou seem a Milton with his Death and Sin.\n\nOne Sunday, preaching in office at St James's, he found, that though he strove to make his audience attentive, he could not prevail. Upon which his pity for their folly got the better of all decorums, and he sat back in the pulpit and burst into a flood of tears. Towards the latter part of life he knew his own infirmities, and suffered himself to be in pupillage to his house-keeper; for he considered that, at a certain time of life, the second childhood of age demanded its wonted protection. His son, whose boyish follies were long obnoxious to paternal severity, was at last forgiven in his will; and our poet died regretted by all, having performed all that man could do to fill his post with dignity.

The method of preparing it is as follows: The cobalt taken out of the mine is broken with hammers into pieces about the size of a hen's egg; and the flinty involucrum, with such other heterogeneous matters as are distinguishable by the eye, are separated as much as possible. The chosen mineral is then pounded in stamping mills, and sifted through brass wire sieves. The lighter parts are washed off by water, and it is afterwards put into a large flat-bottomed arched furnace, resembling a baking oven, where the flame of the wood reverberates upon the ore; which is occasionally stirred and turned with long handled iron hooks or rakes; and the process is continued till it ceases to emit any fumes. The oven or furnace is terminated by a long horizontal gallery, which serves for a chimney; in which the arsenic, naturally mixed with the ore, sublimes. If the ore contains a little bitumen, as this semifluid is very fusible, it is collected at the bottom of the furnace. The cobalt remains in the state of a dark gray oxide, and is called zaffre. One hundred pounds of the cobalt ore lose 20 and even 30 per cent. during this operation, which is continued 4 or even 9 hours, according to the quality of the ore. The roasted ore being taken out from the furnace, such parts as are concreted into lumps are pounded and sifted afresh. Zaffre, in commerce, is never pure, being mixed with two or rather three parts of powdered flints. A proper quantity of the best sort of thefe, after being ignited in a furnace, is thrown into water to render it friable, and more easily reduced to powder; which, being sifted, is mixed with the zaffre, according to the before-mentioned dose; and the mixture is put into casks, after being mitten with water. This oxide, fused with three parts of sand and one of potash, forms a blue glass; which, when pounded, sifted, and afterwards ground in mills, included in large casks, forms faults.\n\nThe blue of zaffre is the most solid and fixed of all the colours that can be employed in vitrification.

It stood in a plain; was stronger by art than nature; richly supplied with every necessary; and abounding in men, and every weapon both of defence and annoyance.\n\nThe last of these is remarkable for the decisive battle fought between the two greatest commanders in the world, Hannibal the Carthaginian and Scipio Africanus. Of this engagement, the most important perhaps that ever was fought, Mr Hooke gives the following account.\n\n\"Scipio drew up his army after the Roman manner, except that he placed the cohorts of the Principes directly behind those of the Hastati, so as to leave sufficient space for the enemy's elephants to pass through...\"\nfrom front to rear. C. Laelius was posted on the left wing with the Italian horse, and Massinissa with his Numidians on the right. The intervals of the first line Scipio filled up with his Velites, or light-armed troops, ordering them, upon a signal given, to begin the battle; and in case they were repulsed, or broke by the elephants, to run back through the lines before mentioned, and continue on their flight till they were got behind the Triarii. Those that were wounded, or in danger of being overtaken, were to turn off to the right and left through the spaces between the lines, and that way escape to the rear.\n\n\"The army thus drawn up, Scipio went from rank to rank, urging his soldiers to consider the consequences of a defeat and the rewards of victory: on the one hand, certain death or slavery (for they had no town in Africa strong enough to protect them); on the other, not only a lasting superiority over Carthage, but the empire of the rest of the world.\n\n\"Hannibal ranged all his elephants, to the number of above 82, in one front. Behind these he placed his mercenaries, consisting of 12,000 men, Ligurians, Gauls, Baleares, and Mauritians.\n\n\"The new levies of Carthaginians and other Africans, together with 4000 Macedonians, under a general named Sopater, composed the second line. And in the rear of all, at the distance of about a furlong, he posted his Italian troops, in whom he chiefly confided. The Carthaginian horse formed his right wing, the Numidians his left.\n\n\"He ordered their several leaders to exhort their troops not to be discouraged by their own weakness, but to place the hope of victory in him and his Italian army; and particularly directed the captains of the Carthaginians to represent to them what would be the fate of their wives and children if the event of this battle should not prove successful. The general himself, walking through the ranks of his Italian troops, called upon them to be mindful of the 17 campaigns in which they had been fellow-soldiers with him; and of that constant series of victories by which they had extinguished in the Romans all hope of ever being conquerors. He urged them to remember, above all, the battles of Trebia, Thrasymenus, and Cannae; with any of which the approaching battle was in no wise to be compared, either with respect to the bravery or the number of the enemy.\n\n\"The Romans were yet unfoiled, and in the height of their strength, when you first met them in the field; nevertheless you vanquished them. The soldiers now before us are either the children of the vanquished, or the remains of those whom you have often put to flight in Italy. Maintain therefore your general's glory and your own, and establish to yourselves the name of invincible, by which you are become famous throughout the world.\"\n\n\"When the Numidians of the two armies had skirmished a while, Hannibal ordered the managers of the elephants to drive them upon the enemy. Some of the beasts, frightened at the noise of the trumpets and other instruments of war which founded on all sides, immediately ran back amongst the Numidians of the Carthaginian left wing, and put them into confusion; which Massinissa taking advantage of, entirely routed them. Great destruction was made of the Velites by the rest of the elephants, till these also being terrified, some of them ran through the void spaces of the Roman army which Scipio had left for that purpose; others falling in among the cavalry of the enemy's right wing, gave Laelius the same opportunity against the Carthaginian horse as had been given to Massinissa against the Numidian, and of which the Roman did not fail to make the same use. After this the infantry of the foremost lines joined battle. Hannibal's mercenaries had the advantage in the beginning of the conflict; but the Roman Hastati, followed and encouraged by the Principes, who exhorted them to fight manfully, and showed themselves ready to assist them, bravely frustrated the attack, and at length gained ground upon the enemy. The mercenaries not being feebly supported by their second line, and therefore thinking themselves betrayed, they in their retreat fell furiously upon the Africans; so that these, the Hastati coming up, were obliged to fight for some time both against their own mercenaries and the enemy. When the two Carthaginian lines had ceased their mutual rage, they joined their strength; and though now but a mere throng of men, broke the Hastati: but then the Principes advancing to the assistance of the latter, restored the battle; and most of the Africans and mercenaries were here cut off. Hannibal did not advance to their relief, the Roman Triarii not having yet engaged, and the Principes being still in good order; and left the routed Africans and mercenaries should break the ranks of his Italian soldiers, he commanded these to present their spears at those who fled to them for protection, which obliged the runaways to move off to the right and left.\n\n\"The ground over which the Romans must march before they could attack Hannibal being strewed with heaps of dead bodies and weapons, and being slippery with blood, Scipio feared that the order of his battalions would be broke, should he pass it hastily. To avoid this mischief, he commanded the Hastati to give over the pursuit, and halt where they were, opposite to the enemy's centre: after which, having sent all his wounded to the rear, he advanced leisurely with the Principes and Triarii, and placed them on the wings of the Hastati. Then followed a sharp engagement, in which victory was long and eagerly disputed. It would seem that the Romans, though superior in number, were once upon the point of losing the day; for Polybius tells us, that Massinissa and Laelius came very feebly, and as if sent from heaven, to their assistance. These generals being returned from the pursuit of the cavalry, fell suddenly upon the rear of Hannibal's men, most of whom were cut off in their ranks; and of those that fled, very few escaped the horse, the country all around being a plain.\n\n\"There died of the Carthaginians in the fight above 20,000, and almost the like number were taken prisoners. The loss on the side of the Romans amounted to about 2000 men. Hannibal escaped with a few horse to Adrumetum, having performed every thing in the engagement which could be expected from a great general. His army (says Polybius) could not have been more skilfully drawn up. For as the order of the Roman battalions makes it extremely difficult to break them, the Carthaginian wisely placed his elephants in the front, that they might put the enemy in confusion before the armies should engage. In his first line he placed the mercenaries; men bold and active, but not well\nwell disciplined, that by their impetuosity he might give\na check to the ardour of the Romans. The Africans\nand Carthaginians, whose courage he doubted, he post-\ned in the middle between the mercenaries and his Ita-\nlian soldiers, that they might be forced to fight, or at\nleast that the Romans, by slaughtering them, might fa-\ntigue themselves and blunt their weapons. Last of all,\nhe drew up the troops he had disciplined himself, and\nin whom he chiefly confided, at a good distance from\nthe second line, that they might not be broken by the\nroute of the Africans and mercenaries, and kept them\nin reserve for a vigorous attack upon a tired and weak-\nened enemy.\"","sp":472,"ep":474},{"h":"ZANGUEBAR","t":"a country in Africa, lying on the\neastern coast, between three degrees of north latitude,\nand 18 south.

See Botany Index.\u2014There is only one spe-\ncies, the Maya, maize. The Indians in New England,\nand many other parts of America, had no other vege-\ntable but maize or Indian corn for making their bread.\nThey call it weachin; and in the United States of A-\nmerica there is much of the bread of the country made\nof this grain, not of the European corn. In Italy and\nGermany also there is a species of maize which is the\nfood of the poor inhabitants.\n\nThe ear of the maize yields a much greater quan-\ntity of grain than any of our corn ears. There are com-\nmonly about eight rows of grain in the ear, often more,\nif the ground be good. Each of these rows contains at\nleast 30 grains, and each of these gives much more\nflour than a grain of any of our corn. The grains are\nusually either white or yellowish; but sometimes they\nare red, bluish, greenish, or olive-coloured, and some-\ntimes striped and variegated. This sort of grain, though\nso essentially necessary to the natives of the place, is yet\nliable to many accidents. It does not ripen till the end\nof September; so that the rains often fall heavy upon it\nwhile on the stalk, and the birds in general peck it\nwhen it is soft and unripe. Nature has, to defend it\nfrom these accidents, covered it with a thick hull,\nwhich keeps off slight rains very well; but the birds, if\nnot frightened away, often eat through it, and devour\na great quantity of the grain.\n\nThere are three or four varieties of maize in different\nparts of America. That of Virginia is very tall and\nrobust, growing to seven or eight feet high; that of\nNew England is shorter and lower. And the Indians\nfarther up in the country have a yet smaller kind in\ncommon use. The stalk of the maize is jointed like the\nsugar-cane; it is very soft and juicy, and the juice is so\nsweet and saccharine, that a syrup, as sweet as that of\nsugar, has been often made of it; and things sweetened\nwith it have been found not distinguishable from those\ndone with sugar. It has not been tried yet whether it\nwill crystallize into sugar; but in all probability it will.\n\nThe Americans plant this corn any time from the be-\nginning of March to the beginning of June; but the\nbest season is the middle of April. The savage Indians,\nwho knew nothing of our account of months, used to\nguide themselves in the seed-time of this useful plant by\nthe budding of some particular trees of that country,\nand by the coming up of a sort of fish into their rivers\nwhich they call the aloofe. These things were both so\nregular, that they were in no danger of mistaking the\ntime.\n\nThe manner of planting maize is in rows, at equal di-\nstances, every way about five or six feet. They open\nthe earth with a hoe, taking away the surface to three\nor four inches deep, and of the breadth of the hoe;\nthen they throw in a little of the finer earth, so as to\nleave the hoe four inches deep or thereabouts, and in each of these holes they place four or five grains at a\nlittle distance from one another. If two or three of\nthese grow up, it is very well; some of them are usual-\nly destroyed either by the birds or other animals.\nWhen the young plants appear, they hoe up the weeds from time to time; and when the stalk gathers some strength, they raise the earth a little about it, and continue this at every hoeing till it begins to put forth the ears; then they enlarge the hill of earth, round the root, to the size of a hop-hill, and after this they leave it till the time of harvest, without any farther care. When they gather the ears, they either immediately strip off the corn, or else hang up the ears, tied in traces at distances from one another; for if they are laid near together, they will heat and rot or else sprout and grow; but kept cool and separate, they will remain good all the winter. The best method is to thrust out the corn as soon as the harvest is over, to dry it well on mats in the sun, and then lay it up in holes of the ground, well lined with mats, grass, or the like, and afterwards covered at top with more earth. The most careful among the Indians use this method, and this sort of subterranean granary always proves good.\n\nThe uses of this plant among the Indians are very many. The great article is the making their bread of it; but besides this, the stalks, when cut up before they are too much dried, are an excellent winter food for cattle; but they usually leave them on the ground for the cattle to feed on. The husks about the ear are usually separated from the rest, and make a particular sort of fodder, not inferior to our hay. The Indian women have a way of splitting them into narrow parts, and then they weave them artificially into baskets and many other toys. The original way of eating the grain among the Indians was this: they boiled it whole in water till it swelled and became tender, and then they fed on it either alone or ate it with their fish and venison instead of bread. After this, they found the way of boiling it into a sort of pudding, after bruising it in a mortar; but the way of reducing it to flour is the best of all. They do this by parching it carefully in the fire, without burning, and then beating it in mortars and setting it. This flour they lay up in bags as their constant provision, and take it out with them when they go to war, eating it either dry or with water. The English have contrived, by mixing it into a stiff paste, either by itself or with rye or wheat-meal, fermenting it with leaven or yeast, and baking it in a hot oven, to make good bread of it. They have likewise found out a method of making good beer, either of the bread or by malting the grain.","sp":474,"ep":475},{"h":"ZEAL","t":"passionate ardour for any person or cause.

It appears from history, that, in times prior to the irruption of the Mahomedans, the rajas who held their residence at Delhi, and possessed the sovereignty of Hindostan, deputed officers to collect their revenues. The word zemindar is Persian, and that language can have had no currency in the countries of India, until it was introduced by the people of Persia. When the emperor Shehab-ul-Dien Ghory conquered the empire of Hindostan at the end of the 12th century, he left Sultan Cutub-ul-Dien to be his viceroy at Delhi, and administer the government of Hindostan. From that time the customs and practices of the Mahomedans began gradually to be established in India: their armies were sent into the countries of the reduced rajas, under the command of omrahs, in order to preserve the conquest; and lands were allotted to them to defray the expense. From hence arose the system of Jaghireddary in Hindostan. But when these Omrah Jaghireddars had established their own strength, several of them rebelled against the imperial authority, and aspired at the crown. Thus circumstanced, the emperors, in order to obviate these mischiefs, thought it would be more politic to commit the management of the country to the native Hindoos, who had most distinguished themselves by the readiness and constancy of their obedience to the sovereign power.\n\nIn pursuance of this plan, districts were allotted to numbers of them under a reasonable revenue (Jummah Monalib), which they were required to pay in money to the governors of the provinces, deputed from the emperor. And in case any one of the omrahs or provincial governors should swerve from his allegiance, the zemindars of that country were to exert themselves in such a manner as should check rebellion, and restore good government. For this purpose, grants of zemindary were frequently conferred upon such of the Hindoos as were obedient; describing their apportionment of the country; and every person who had received a grant under the authority of the crown was thereby fully invested with the functions of zemindar.\n\nThe functions of a zemindar are, 1st, The preservation and defence of their respective boundaries from traitors and insurgents. 2dly, The tranquillity of the subjects, the abundance of cultivators, and increase of his revenue. 3dly, The punishment of thieves and robbers, the prevention of crimes, and the destruction of highwaymen. The accomplishment of these objects is considered in the royal grant as the discharge of office to the sovereign; and on that account the word office (khidmat) is employed in the Dewanny Sunnud for a zemindary.\n\nIt was a rule in the times of the ancient emperors, that when any of the zemindars died, their effects and property were sequestrated by the government. After which, in consideration of the rights of long service, which is incumbent on sovereigns, and elevates the dignity of the employer, funnuds for the office of zemindar were granted to the children of the deceased zemindar; and no other person was accepted, because the inhabitants could never feel for any stranger the attachment and affection which they naturally entertain for the family of their zemindar, and would have been afflicted if any other had been put over them. For this reason, the emperors, considering it as a means of conciliating the minds of the people, graciously fixed and confirmed the children of the deceased zemindar in the office of their fathers and grandfathers, by issuing new funnuds to transfer the possession to them. By degrees zemindaries became truly heritable property, which, however, could be transferred by gift or sale from one family to another. They could likewise be forfeited to the sovereign, by the zemindar's deviating from his allegiance, neglecting to pay his tribute, or to discharge the duties of his station.\n\nIt is universally known, says Sir Charles Routh Boughton, that, when the three provinces of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa, were ceded to the British East India Company, the country was distributed among the zemindars and talookdars or holders of land, who paid a stipulated revenue, by twelve instalments, to the sovereign power or its delegates. They assembled at the capital in the beginning of every Bengal year (commencing in April), in order to complete their final payments, and make up their annual accounts; to settle the discount to be charged upon their several remittances in various coins for the purpose of reducing them to one standard, or adjust their concerns with their bankers; to petition for remissions on account of storms, drought, inundation, disturbances, and such like; to make their representations of the state and occurrences of their districts: after all which they entered upon the collections of the new year; of which, however, they were not permitted to begin receiving the rents from their own farmers, till they had completely closed the accounts of the preceding year, so that they might not encroach upon the new rents, to make up the deficiency of the past. Our author proves, we think completely, the right of the zemindars to transfer their possessions, either by inheritance to their children, or, with the consent of the sovereign, to other families; and he argues strenuously and successfully against the bad policy, as well as injustice, of interfering with these rights, as long as the zemindars discharge the duties of their several stations.","sp":475,"ep":476},{"h":"ZEND","t":"or ZENDAVESTA, a book ascribed to Zoroaster, and containing his pretended revelations; which the ancient Magicians and modern Persees, called also Gours, observe reverence in the same manner as the Christians do the Bible, and the Mahometans the Koran, making it the sole rule both of their faith and manners. The word, it is said, originally signifies any instrument for kindling fire, and is applied to this book to denote its aptitude for kindling the flame of religion in the hearts of those who read it.\n\nThe Zend contains a reformed system of Magianism, teaching that there is a Supreme Being, eternal, self-existent, and independent, who created both light and darkness, out of which he made all other things; that these are in a state of conflict, which will continue till the end of the world; that then there shall be a general resurrection and judgement; and that just retribution shall\nshall be rendered unto men according to their works; that the angel of darkness with his followers shall be configned to a place of everlasting darkness and punishment, and the angel of light with his disciples introduced into a state of everlasting light and happiness; after which light and darkness shall no more interfere with each other. The Zend also enjoins the constant maintenance of sacred fires and fire temples for religious worship; the distinction of clean and unclean beasts; the payment of tithes to priests, which are to be of one family or tribe; a multitude of washings and purifications, resembling those of the Jewish law; and a variety of rules and exhortations for the exercise of benevolence and charity.\n\nIn this book there are many passages evidently taken out of the Scriptures of the Old Testament, particularly out of the Psalms of David: The author represents Adam and Eve as the first parents of all mankind, gives in substance the same account of the creation and deluge with Moses, differing indeed with regard to the former, by converting the six days of the Mosaic account into five times, comprehending in the whole 365 days; and speaks also of Abraham, Joseph, Moses, and Solomon. Moreover, Dr Baumgarten affirms, that this work contains doctrines, opinions, and facts, actually borrowed from the Jews, Christians, and Mahometans; whence, and from other circumstances, he concludes that both the history and writings of this prophet were probably invented in the later ages, when the fire-worshippers under the Mahometan government thought fit to vindicate their religion from the suspicion of idolatry.\n\nAt whatever period the Zend may have been written, we are assured by Dr Hyde, that it is in the pure old Persian language, and in the character called Pahlavi. Some parts of it contain the original next, and others Zoroaster's second thoughts subjoined, for explaining more fully his doctrine. These were occasioned by the opposition of adversaries, and unforeseen circumstances which occurred during the fabrication of the imposture. About 300 years ago, when the old Persian language had become antiquated and little understood, one of the deacons or high-priests among the Persians composed the Sadda, which is a compendium in the vulgar or modern Persian tongue, of those parts of the Zend that relate to religion, or a kind of code of canons and precepts, drawn from the theological writings of Zoroaster, serving as an authoritative rule of faith and practice for his followers. This Sadda is written in a low kind of Persian verse, and as Dr Hyde informs us, it is bonorum et malorum farra, having many good and pious things, and others very superstitious and trifling. See Perseus and Zoroaster.","sp":476,"ep":477},{"h":"ZENITH","t":"in Astronomy, the vertical point, or a point in the heavens directly over our heads.\n\nZENO Eleates, an eminent Grecian philosopher, was born at Elea about 504 years before Christ. He was a zealous friend of civil liberty, and is celebrated for his courageous and successful opposition to tyrants; but the inconclusiveness of the stories related by different writers concerning him in a great measure destroys their credit. He chose to reside in his small native city of Elea rather than at Athens, because it afforded freer scope to his independent and generous spirit, which could not easily submit to the restraints of authority. It is related, that he vindicated the warmth with which he received reproach, by saying, \"If I were indifferent to censure, I should also be indifferent to praise.\" The invention of the dialectic art has been improperly ascribed to Zeno; but there can be no doubt that this philosopher, and other metaphysical disputants in the Eleatic sect, employed much ingenuity and subtlety in exhibiting examples of most of the logical arts, which were afterwards reduced to rule by Aristotle and others.\n\nAccording to Aristotle, he taught, that nothing can be produced either from that which is similar or dissimilar; that there is only one being, God; who is eternal, homogeneous, and spherical, neither finite nor infinite, neither quiescent nor moveable; that there are many worlds; that there is in nature no vacuum; that all bodies are composed of four elements, heat and moisture, cold and dryness; and that the body of man is from the earth, and his soul an equal mixture of these four elements. He argued with great subtlety against the possibility of motion. If Seneca's account of this philosopher deserves credit, he reached the highest point of skepticism, and denied the real existence of external objects. The truth is, that after all that has been advanced by different writers, it is impossible to determine whether Zeno understood the term one, metaphysically, logically, or physically; or whether he admitted or denied a nature properly divine.\n\nZeno, the founder of the sect of the Stoics, was born about 300 years before Christ at Citium, in the island of Cyprus. This place having been originally peopled by a colony of Phoenicians, Zeno is sometimes called a Phoenician. His father was by profession a merchant, but discovering in the youth a strong propensity towards learning, he early devoted him to philosophy. In his mercantile capacity he had frequent occasion to visit Athens, where he purchased for his son several of the writings of the most eminent Socratic philosophers. These he read with great avidity; and when he was about 30 years of age, he determined to take a voyage to a city which was so celebrated both as a mart of trade and of science. If it be true, as some writers relate, that he brought with him a valuable cargo of Phoenician purple, which was lost by shipwreck upon the coast of Piraeus, this circumstance will account for the facility with which he at first attached himself to a sect whose leading principle was the contempt of riches. Upon his first arrival in Athens, going accidentally into the shop of a bookseller, he took up a volume of the Commentaries of Xenophon; and after reading a few passages, was so much delighted with the work, and formed so high an idea of the author, that he asked the bookseller where he might meet with such men. Crates the Cynic philosopher happening at that instant to be passing by, the bookseller pointed to him, and said, \"Follow that man.\" Zeno attended upon the instructions of Crates, and was so well pleased with his doctrine that he became one of his disciples. But though he admired the general principles of the Cynic school, he could not easily reconcile himself to their peculiar manners. Besides, his inquisitive turn of mind would not allow him to adopt that indifference to every scientific inquiry which was one of the characteristic distinctions of the sect. He therefore attended upon other matters, who professed to instruct their disciples in the nature and causes of things. When Crates, displeased at his following other philosophers, attempted to drag him by force out of the school of Stilpo, Zeno\nsaid to him, \"You may take my body, but Stilpo has laid hold of my mind.\" After continuing to attend upon the lectures of Stilpo several years, he passed over to other schools, particularly to those of Xenocrates and Diodorus Cronus. By the latter he was instructed in dialectics. He was so much delighted with this branch of study, that he presented to his master a large pecuniary gratuity, in return for his free communication of some of his ingenious subtleties. At last, after attending almost every other matter, he offered himself as a disciple of Polemo. This philosopher appears to have been aware, that Zeno's intention in thus removing from one school to another, was to collect materials from various quarters for a new system of his own; for, when he came into Polemo's school, he said to him, \"I am no stranger, Zeno, to your Phoenician arts; I perceive that your design is to creep flyly into my garden, and steal away my fruit.\" Polemo was not mistaken in his opinion. Having made himself master of the tenets of others, Zeno determined to become the founder of a new sect. The place which he made choice of for his school was a public portico, adorned with the pictures of Polygnotus, and other eminent painters. It was the most famous portico in Athens, and called, by way of eminence, \u03a3\u03c4\u03bf\u03ac, \"the Porch.\" It was from this circumstance that the followers of Zeno were called Stoics.\n\nIn his person Zeno was tall and slender; his aspect was severe, and his brow contracted. His constitution was feeble, but he preserved his health by great abstinence. The supplies of his table consisted of figs, bread, and honey; notwithstanding which, he was frequently honoured with the company of great men. In public company, to avoid every appearance of an assuming temper, he commonly took the lowest place. Indeed so great was his modesty, that he seldom chose to mingle with a crowd, or wished for the company of more than two or three friends at once. He paid more attention to neatness and decorum in external appearance than the Cynic philosophers. In his dress indeed he was plain, and in all his expenses frugal; but this is not to be imputed to avarice, but a contempt of external magnificence. He showed as much respect to the poor as to the rich; and conversed freely with persons of the meanest occupations. He had only one servant, or, according to Seneca, none.\n\nZeno lived to the extreme age of 98; and at last, in consequence of an accident, voluntarily put an end to his life. As he was walking out of his school he fell down, and in the fall broke one of his fingers; upon which he was so affected with a consciousness of infirmity, that, striking the earth, he said, \"Why am I thus importuned? I obey thy summons;\" and immediately went home and strangled himself. He died in the first year of the 120th Olympiad. The Athenians, at the request of Antigonus, erected a monument to his memory in the Ceramicum.\n\nWe ought not to confound the two Zenos already mentioned with","sp":477,"ep":478},{"h":"ZENO","t":"a celebrated Epicurean philosopher, born at Sidon, who had Cicero and Pomponius Atticus for his disciples, and who wrote a book against the mathematics, which, as well as that of Poliphilius's refutation of it, is lost; nor with several other Zenos mentioned in history.","sp":478,"ep":478},{"h":"ZENOBIUS","t":"queen of Palmyra.

He was born at Heraclea; but as there have been many cities of that name, it cannot be certainly determined which of them had the honour of his birth. Some learned men, however, conjecture, that it was the Heraclea near Crotona in Italy. He carried painting to a much higher degree of perfection than Apollodorus had left it; discovered the art of properly disposing of lights and shades, and particularly excelled in colouring. He amassed immense riches; and then resolved to sell no more of his pictures, but gave them away; saying very frankly, \"That he could not set a price on them equal to their value.\" Before this time he made people pay for seeing them; and nobody was admitted to see his Helena without ready money, which occasioned the wags calling his picture Helen the Courtezan. It is not known whether this Helen of Zeuxis was the same with that which was at Rome in Pliny's time, or that which he painted for the inhabitants\nZeuxis inhabitants of Crotona to be hung up in the temple of Juno: this last he painted from five beautiful girls of that city, copying from each her greatest excellencies. Pliny observes, that this admirable painter, disputing for the prize of painting with Parrhasius, painted some grapes so naturally, that the birds flew down to peck them. Parrhasius, on the other hand, painted a curtain so very artfully, that Zeuxis mistaking it for a real one that hid his rival's work, ordered the curtain to be drawn aside, to show what Parrhasius had done; but having found his mistake, he ingeniously confessed himself vanquished, since he had only imposed upon birds, while Parrhasius had deceived even a matter of the art. Another time he painted a boy loaded with grapes; when the birds also flew to this picture, at which he was vexed; and confessed, that this work was not sufficiently finished, since had he painted the boy as perfectly as the grapes, the birds would have been afraid of him. Archelaus, king of Macedon, made use of Zeuxis's pencil for the embellishment of his palace. One of this painter's finest pieces was a Hercules strangling some serpents in his cradle, in the presence of his affrighted mother: but he himself chiefly effeemed his Athleta, or Champion, under which he placed a Greek verse that afterwards became very famous, and in which he says, \"That it was easier to criticise than to imitate the picture.\" He made a present of his Alcmena to the Argigarettes. Zeuxis did not value himself on speedily finishing his pictures; but knowing that Agatharchus gloried in his being able to paint with ease and in a little time, he said, \"That for his part he, on the contrary, gloried in his slowness; and, if he was long in painting, it was because he painted for eternity.\" Verrius Flaccus says, that Zeuxis having painted an old woman, he laughed so very heartily at the sight of this picture, that he died: but as no other of the ancients has mentioned this particular, there is the greatest reason to believe it fabulous.

For an account of the properties and combinations of zinc, as they were then known, see Chemistry Index; and for the history of its ores, see Mineralogy Index.\n\nBut in the progress of chemical discovery it has been found that zinc is not a less perfect metal than others; for in the year 1805, it was announced that a patent was granted to Mr. Hobson and Sylvester of Sheffield for a method of manufacturing zinc. From their discovery it appears, that zinc raised to a temperature of between 210\u00b0 and 300\u00b0 of Fahrenheit, is not only very malleable, but may be passed through rollers, or drawn into wire. After the metal has been treated in this manner, it does not return to its former brittleness, but continues soft, flexible, and extensible, and may be applied to many uses for which this metal was before thought unfit.\n\nWe must, however, notice, that a prior claim to the discovery of rendering zinc ductile and malleable, has been made by Mr. Lowry, in favour of a Mr. Sheffield of Somerton. Twenty years before the time of Mr. Hobson and Sylvester's patent being announced, Mr. Sheffield, in making an alloy of some blende, was impatient to examine the metal, struck an ingot for the purpose of breaking it while it was yet hot, but was much surprised to find instead of being brittle, and breaking with the usual fracture of zinc, it was extremely tough, and when he succeeded in breaking it, after many bendings backward and forward, it exhibited a steel-grained fibrous texture. At first he doubted of the metal being zinc, but he repeated the experiment on what he knew to be pure metal, and obtained the same result; and from this he concluded that zinc at a certain temperature is equally malleable and ductile with other metals. This he found to be the case by drawing it into wire, and laminating it between rollers, by which he produced plates not exceeding the 1/30 of an inch, and possessing the strength and tenacity of silver.\n\nSince the time that our article Chemistry was printed, the decomposition of potash, soda, the alkaline earths, and some other bodies which were formerly considered as simple, or were only conjectured from analogy to be compound, has been effected by Mr. Davy; and as we were disposed to entertain hopes that something new might be added to the unexpected and brilliant discoveries of that celebrated chemist, we have deferred, till near the close of our work, giving any account of them. This is the reason that the fact was merely announced under the words Potash and Soda, and a reference made to Galvanic Trough, under which it was intended to give a short description of the apparatus employed in the experiments which led to the discoveries alluded to. For the same reason we were induced to make a farther reference to this place, because zinc is\none of the metallic substances usually employed in the construction of galvanic apparatus. We shall therefore here employ a few pages, 1st, In a description of the improvements which have been made in the construction of galvanic apparatus; and, 2d, We shall lay before our readers a view of the discoveries in galvanic electricity since the treatises on Chemistry and Galvanism in this work were printed.\n\nGalvanic Apparatus.\u2014A very considerable improvement has been made on the construction of galvanic batteries, by which they are rendered, not only more convenient and manageable, but far more powerful. Under the article Galvanism, we have described particularly the construction of the galvanic trough, and we have noticed that the soldering of the plates of zinc and copper employed for this purpose was attended with considerable difficulty. In the new method of construction the plates are not soldered together, but are merely connected by means of a metallic arc. In this way each pair of plates can be removed from the trough at pleasure, for the purpose of examining and cleaning them. The new apparatus is constructed precisely on the same principle as the couronne de Taffes, proposed by Volta, and described at p. 333 of Galvanism. The trough employed in this apparatus is prepared in the same way as when the plates of zinc and copper soldered together were fixed in it by means of cement; but in place of the metallic plates, plates of glass, or some other non-conducting substance, are introduced and secured by cement, so that there shall be no communication between the different cells into which the liquid is introduced. The plates of zinc and copper connected by means of the metallic arc, at the distance of about half an inch, are placed in different cells, having a plate of glass between each pair of plates. Each cell then contains a plate of each of the metals, which are unconnected, excepting through the medium of the liquid which is to be the conductor of the electricity. It is scarcely necessary to mention, that the proper order of arrangement shall be observed, so that throughout the whole trough or battery there shall be a series of zinc, copper, and liquid.\n\nBeside the convenience and simplicity of this mode of constructing galvanic troughs, it possesses this farther advantage of being more powerful, because instead of one surface of the plates, as in the former construction of this apparatus, both surfaces are exposed to the action of electricity, and therefore the power is greatly increased. A farther improvement, it is said, has been made in constructing batteries of this kind, which consists in employing troughs of Wedgwood's ware, with partitions of the same material, instead of wooden troughs with partitions of glass. This improvement was first suggested by Dr Babington.\n\nThe following is the account of the construction of galvanic apparatus, with the view of ascertaining in what way the greatest effect might be produced, with the least waste of power and expense. The experiments which we are now to mention were made by Mr Children*. For this purpose a battery was constructed on the new method, with plates of copper and zinc, connected by leaden strips, soldered on the top of each pair of plates. Twenty pairs of plates were employed, and each plate was four feet high by two feet wide. The whole extent of surface exposed amounted to 92,160 square inches; the trough was made of wood, with wooden partitions, covered with cement, to resist the action of the acid employed. The battery was charged with a mixture of three parts of fuming nitrous, and one of sulphuric acid, diluted with thirty of water; the quantity employed was 120 gallons. With this apparatus the following experiments were made.\n\nExper. 1. Eighteen inches of platina wire, of one-thirtieth of an inch diameter were completely fused in about twenty seconds. Exper. 2. Three feet of the same wire were heated to a bright red, visible by strong daylight. Exper. 3. Four feet of the same wire were rendered very hot, but not perceptibly red by daylight. Exper. 4. Charcoal burnt with intense brilliancy. Exper. 5. Ten inches of iron-wire of 1/4th of an inch diameter, were barely fused; three feet of the same wire were not ignited. Exper. 6. No effect was produced on imperfect conductors. Exper. 7. The gold leaves of the electrometer were not affected. Exper. 8. When the cuticle was dry, no shock was given by the battery, and it was scarcely perceptible when the skin was wet.\n\nTo contrast the effects of this apparatus with another differing in the size and number of plates, the author employed 200 pairs of plates, each about two inches square, placed in half pint pots of common queen's ware. The same liquid was employed, with the addition of a fresh portion of sulphuric acid, in the proportion of about a quarter of a pint to a gallon. The experiments with this apparatus gave the following results.\n\nExper. 1. Potash and barytes were readily decomposed. Exper. 2. The metallization of ammonia was produced with great facility. Exper. 3. Charcoal was vividly ignited. Exper. 4. The gold leaves of the electrometer diverged considerably. Exper. 5. After the battery was in action three hours, it gave a vivid spark; at the end of 24 hours it metallized ammonia; at the end of 41 hours it was nearly exhausted. From the results of these experiments, Mr Children concludes, that the theory of the mode of action of the voltaic battery proposed by Mr Davy is confirmed, namely, that the intensity increases with the number, and the quantity with the extent of the series. This is proved by the effects produced on the platina and iron wires, in the 1st and 5th experiments with the large battery, as well as by the experiments on imperfect conductors in the small apparatus; for as the platina wire is a perfect conductor, and not liable to oxidation, it allows the electricities to be freely transmitted, and from the immense quantity given out from a surface of such extent, they evolve, on their mutual annihilation, heat sufficient to raise the temperature of the platina to the point of fusion. But a very small portion of the electricity passes through the iron wire, in consequence of its easy oxidation, and the thin coat of oxide formed on its surface. This arises from the low state of the intensity of the electricity, as appears also from its want of power on the gold leaves of the electrometer. From the same deficient intensity, the decomposition of barytes could not be effected by the large battery, and the same battery exhibited a very weak action on imperfect conductors; but the small battery exerted great power on that class of bodies, and decomposed them readily, although its surface was 30 times less than the surface of the great battery; but the number...\nZinc. ber of plates was nearly ten times greater. Another circumstance, of considerable importance in conducting experiments by means of the galvanic battery, is here noticed by the author; that the long continued action of the small battery was owing to the large capacity of the cells containing a proportional quantity of liquor. And beside this advantage he adds, that with very large combinations, a certain distance between each pair of plates is absolutely necessary to prevent spontaneous discharges, which are accompanied with vivid flashes of electric light. This happened to the author with a battery of 1250 four-inch plates, constructed according to the new method.\n\nFrom the experiments and observations, some of which we have detailed, and for others we refer to the paper itself, the author concludes with the following remarks: \"The absolute effect of a voltaic apparatus seems to be in the compound ratio of the number and size of the plates. The intensity of the electricity being as the former, the quantity given out as the latter, consequently regard must be had, in its construction, to the purpose for which it is designed. For experiments on imperfect conductors, very large plates are to be preferred, a small number of which will probably be sufficient; but where the resistance of imperfect conductors is to be overcome, the combination must be great, but the size of the plates may be small: but if quantity and intensity be both required, then a large number of large plates will be necessary. For general purposes, four inches square will be found to be the most convenient size.\"\n\n* Ibid. 37.\n\nDiscoveries in Galvanism.\u2014At the close of the article Galvanism, we noticed some experiments which were made about the beginning of the year 1805, which seemed to lead to the conclusion, that muriatic acid and soda were formed by means of galvanic electricity. In experiments on the decomposition of water, which was supposed to be in a state of the utmost purity, the appearance of muriatic acid and soda was adduced in support of this opinion. The accuracy of this conclusion, which seemed to be at variance with known facts, excited doubt, and probably led to the investigation which was undertaken by Mr Davy, and carried on with great ingenuity and address by the same philosopher, till it terminated in the brilliant discoveries, an account of which we are now to detail. Mr Davy's researches in galvanism, an account of which he laid before the Royal Society in a memoir entitled, On Some Chemical Agencies of Electricity, may be considered as the first step in this train of investigation.\n\nWith the view of disproving the accuracy of the experiments in which the generation of acids and alkalies was supposed to have been effected by means of galvanism, Mr Davy employed agate cups, (fig. 1.), of a cylindrical form, and containing about one-fourth of a cubic inch each. The cups were boiled for some hours in distilled water, and a piece of white transparent amianthus, which had been treated in the same way, was made to connect them. They were then filled with distilled water, and exposed by means of two platina wires, to a current of electricity, from 150 pairs of plates of copper and zinc, four inches square. The liquid employed was a solution of alum. The action continued 48 hours, and the process was then examined. Paper tinged with litmus introduced into the tube containing the positive wire, was reddened; paper coloured by turmeric placed in the other tube, had its colour deepened; the acid matter produced a slight turbidity in a solution of nitrate of silver; the fluid from the negative tube retained the property of affecting the turmeric after being boiled, and indeed became more vivid as the quantity was diminished by evaporation. Carbonate of ammonia was added, and the whole being dried, and exposed to a strong heat, a minute quantity of white matter remained, which had all the properties of carbonate of soda.\n\nThe same experiment was repeated with glass tubes, and the result was, that the quantity of alkali obtained was 20 times greater, but no traces of muriatic acid could be perceived. Mr Davy suspecting that the agate might contain a minute portion of saline matter, repeated the experiment four times. The quantity of alkaline matter diminished in every operation, and in the last process, although the battery had been kept in great activity for three days, the fluid possessed in a slight degree only the power of acting on paper tinged with turmeric; but its alkaline property was very sensible to litmus paper slightly reddened. The acid matter in the other tube was abundant; it had a four-talfe, and produced no effect on solution of muriate of barbtes, but left a black stain from a drop on a polished plate of silver. Thus it appeared to be extremely diluted nitrous acid.\n\nFor the purpose of making the experiment with greater accuracy, two hollow cones of pure gold (fig. 2.) Fig. 2. were employed, each containing about 25 grains of water. They were filled with distilled water, connected by moistened amianthus, as before, and exposed to the action of a battery of 100 pairs of plates of six inches square. The liquid used was a solution of alum, and diluted sulphuric acid. In ten minutes the water in the negative tube changed litmus paper to a light blue, and the water in the positive tube produced a red tint. The process having continued for 14 hours, the acid was found to increase in quantity during the whole time, but the alkaline fluid in the other tube did not affect the tests more than in the first trial. The acid seemed to be the pure nitrous, with an excess of nitrous gas. The experiment was repeated, and the process carried on for three days, and similar results were obtained. From these experiments it was concluded, that the distilled water contained a minute portion of saline matter, but so minute indeed, that it was insensible to the most delicate chemical tests. This appeared to be the case by evaporating a quantity of the distilled water that was used, very slowly, at a heat below 140\u00b0 Fahrenheit, in a silver still. A quantity of solid matter equal to seven-tenths of a grain, of a saline but metallic taste, was obtained. It seemed to be a mixture of nitrate of soda and nitrate of lead. Mr Davy then employed some of the water collected in the second process of slow distillation, in another experiment with the gold tubes and connecting amianthus. At the end of two hours the water in the negative tube had no effect on turmeric paper; litmus, it could just be perceived, was changed; but by heating the water strongly for two or three minutes, it was deprived even of this power, and from this he supposes that it was owing to a small quantity of ammonia. A similar experiment was made with a portion of the same water in the agate tubes, and precisely the same results were obtained. From these experiments\nexperiments Mr Davy fairly concludes, that the fixed alkali is not generated during the process, but merely evolved, either from the solid materials employed, or from saline matter in the water.\n\nMany experiments were made in vessels composed of different substances, with the water procured by slow distillation; and in almost every instance some fixed alkali appeared. When tubes of wax were employed, the alkaline matter was a mixture of soda and potash, and the acid matter, a mixture of sulphuric, muriatic, and nitric acids. A tube of resin afforded alkaline matter, which was principally potash. A cube of Carrara marble of about an inch, having an aperture in its centre, was placed in a platina crucible, which was filled as high as the upper surface of the cube, with the purified water. The aperture was filled with the same liquid, and the crucible was positively electrified by a powerful battery, and the negatively electrified wire introduced into the aperture. Fixed alkali and lime were obtained in this experiment; the quantity of alkali diminishing as the experiment was repeated, and after 11 processes, each continued for two or three hours, disappeared altogether. The quantity of lime-water obtained was uniform.\n\nWhen 500 grains of this marble were analyzed, they afforded about three-fourths of a grain of fixed saline matter, having soda for its base. Suspecting that the Carrara marble might have been recently exposed to sea water, Mr Davy subjected to a similar experiment, a piece of granular marble from the mountains of Donegal, and by means of negative electricity he obtained fixed alkali. Argillaceous schistus from Cornwall gave the same result, and serpentine and gray wacken both afforded soda.\n\nIn other experiments Mr Davy subjected other bodies to the action of the same power, with the view of effecting a decomposition. Thus, two cups of compact sulphate of lime, each containing about 14 grain measures of water, were connected by fibrous sulphate of lime moistened with pure water. The cups were filled with the same fluid, and they were introduced into the circuit of a galvanic battery with 100 pairs of plates of six inches. In five minutes the water in the positive cup became acid, while that in the opposite cup tinged turmeric. An hour after, a saturated solution of lime was formed in the negative cup, and the other contained a solution of sulphuric acid of moderate strength.\n\nTwo cubical pieces of crystallized sulphate of strontites, of about an inch, with a hole drilled in each, capable of receiving eight grains of water, were plunged in pure water, in a platina crucible, and the level of the fluid was kept a few lines below the surface of the cubes. The holes in the earthy mineral were filled with pure water, and two platina wires were introduced into them. At the end of thirty hours the fluid in the cavity of the negative side precipitated solution of sulphate of potash, and sulphuric acid appeared in the other.\n\nTwo pieces of fluate of lime, having each a cavity, and connected by moist asbestos, were subjected to a similar experiment. The decomposition was slow; but in two days a solution of lime appeared in the one tube, and an acid in the other, which precipitated acetate of lead, and left a spot upon the glass, from which it was evaporated, so that it must have been fluoric acid.\n\nCompact zeolite being prepared in the same way, and electrified in the same manner as the cube of Carrara marble, afforded soda and lime. Lepidolite, by similar treatment, gave potash; and an alkaline matter, which seemed to be a mixture of soda, potash and lime, was extracted from a piece of vitreous lava from Mount Etna.\n\nThe decomposition of saline bodies, which are soluble in water, was more rapid. A diluted solution of sulphate of potash introduced into the agate cups connected by amianthus moistened with pure water, being electrified by a battery with 50 pairs of plates, produced in four hours a weak solution of potash in the negative cup, and a solution of sulphuric acid in the positive cup. Similar phenomena were observed when sulphate of soda, nitrate of potash, nitrate of barytes, sulphate of ammonia, phosphate of soda, succinate, oxalate, and benzoate of ammonia and alum, were employed. The acids in a certain time collected in the tube containing the positive wire, and the alkalies and earths in the negative tube. Solutions of the muriatic salts, subjected to decomposition by the same processes, uniformly afforded oxy-muriatic acid on the positive side.\n\nSaturated saline solutions were most rapidly decomposed, but the smallest proportion was also acted on. Thus, if a piece of paper tinged with turmeric be plunged into pure water, in a proper circuit, in contact with the negative point, the minute quantity of saline compound contained in the paper, produces instantly a brown tint near its point of contact. Acid appears also from litmus paper at the positive surface.\n\nExperiments were made with the view of ascertaining whether in these processes the separation of the constituent parts was complete, from the last portions of the compound. The following experiment shows that this is the case. \"A very weak solution of sulphate of potash, containing 20 parts of water, and one part of saturated solution at 64\u00b0, was electrified in the two agate cups, by the power of 50 pairs of plates for three days; the connecting amianthus which had been moistened with pure water, was removed, washed with pure water, and again applied twice every day. By this precaution the presence of any neutral salt that might adhere to it, and disturb the results, was prevented. The alkali obtained in this process in the solution had the properties of pure potash, and when it had been saturated with nitric acid, it gave no turbidity by mixture with solution of muriate of barytes; the acid matter exposed to a strong heat, evaporated, without leaving any residuum.\"\n\nMr Davy then made experiments on the transfer of certain of the constituent parts of bodies, and also on the passage of acids, alkalies, and other substances, through various attracting chemical membranes, by means of electricity, and in these experiments he obtained many curious and interesting results; but for an account of them, as well as of his observations on the different phenomena, and on the mode of decomposition and transition, we must refer to the memoir itself.\n\nAfter the investigations in which Mr Davy had been occupied, and the singular and unexpected results which he obtained, he ventured to conclude, from the general principles on which the phenomena might be explained, that the new methods of proceeding would lead to a more intimate knowledge concerning the true elements of\nZinc of bodies. Accordingly, in November 1827, he laid before the Royal Society a most interesting detail of an elaborate series of experiments on the decomposition of the alkalis.\n\nDecomposition of the Alkalis.\n\nIn the first attempts that were made on the decomposition of potash, Mr Davy employed an aqueous solution, saturated at a common temperature. It was exposed to the action of a powerful galvanic battery, composed of 24 plates of copper and zinc of 12 inches square, 100 plates of six inches, and 150 plates of four inches square, charged with solutions of alum and nitrous acid. The action was very intense; a great deal of heat and violent effervescence were produced, but the water only of the solution was affected, and its hydrogen and oxygen were disengaged. Potash in the state of igneous fusion, in a spoon of platinum, was next subjected to the action of a battery of 100 plates of six inches, highly charged. The spoon was connected with the positive side. In this experiment some brilliant phenomena were produced. The potash appeared to be a good conductor; and, while the communication was preserved, a most intense light was emitted from the negative wire, and a column of flame, seemingly owing to the development of combustible matter, arose from the point of contact. When the order was reversed, and the platinum spoon was connected with the negative side, a vivid and constant light appeared at the opposite point. There was no inflammation round it; but aeriform globules, which inflamed in the atmosphere, rose through the potash. The platinum was considerably acted on.\n\nAlthough potash, when perfectly dry, be a non-conductor, it acquires a conducting power by being slightly moistened. A small piece of pure potash exposed for a few seconds to the atmosphere, was placed on a disc of platinum connected with the negative side of a battery of 250 plates of six and four inches, in a state of intense activity. A platinum wire from the opposite side was brought into contact with the upper surface of the alkali. A vivid action soon took place. The potash fused at both points of electrification; a violent effervescence appeared at the upper surface; but at the lower or negative surface no elastic fluid was emitted, but small globules like quicksilver were produced, some of which burnt with explosion and bright flame as they were formed, and others remained and were only tarnished, and finally covered by a white film formed on their surfaces. These globules were the basis of potash. The same results were obtained, when gold and other metals, plumbago, or charcoal, were employed; and the effects were the same when the process was conducted in an exhausted receiver.\n\nMr Davy also obtained the same substance from potash, fused by means of a lamp, and placed in glass tubes confined by mercury, and furnished with hermetically inserted platinum wires, to transmit the electricity; but the glass was rapidly dissolved by the action of the alkali, so that the process could not be long carried on.\n\nIn these experiments on potash, the combustible base was produced from the negative surface, and oxygen was evolved from the positive surface. The same effects invariably followed, when the experiment was conducted above mercury. The same thing was proved synthetically. The combustible substance obtained from the potash had its metallic lustre destroyed in the atmosphere, and a white crust formed upon it. This crust was found, upon examination, to be pure potash; but this was still farther confirmed by placing globules of the combustible matter in tubes containing common air, or oxygen gas, confined by mercury. An absorption of the oxygen took place, and a crust of alkali was formed upon the globule. When the combustible matter contained in given portions of oxygen, was strongly heated, a rapid combustion, with a brilliant white flame, was produced, and the metallic globules were converted into a white and solid mass, which was found to be pure potash.\n\nTo the combustible matter thus obtained from potash, Mr Davy gave the name of potassium. From its strong affinity for oxygen, it was extremely difficult to preserve it unchanged, for the purpose of examining its properties. The substance which he found to be least affected, is newly distilled naphtha. In this fluid potassium may be kept for many days nearly unaltered, and its physical properties may be examined in the atmosphere, when covered by a thin film of it.\n\nPotassium, at 65\u00b0 Fahrenheit, is in the form of small globules, which have the metallic lustre and general appearance of mercury; at 70\u00b0 it becomes more fluid, and at 100\u00b0, different globules easily run into one. At 50\u00b0 of Fahrenheit it is soft and malleable, and exhibits the lustre of polished silver. At 32\u00b0 it becomes hard and brittle, and, when broken, presents a crystallized texture. To reduce it to vapour, it requires a red heat; and in proper circumstances, it may be subjected to distillation, without change. It is a good conductor of heat, and a perfect conductor of electricity.\n\nIn the properties now mentioned, potassium approaches nearly to the metals; but it is very different in its specific gravity. In naphtha of the specific gravity of .861 it rose to the surface; and it did not sink in double distilled naphtha, the specific gravity of which was about .770. From these and other experiments, Mr Davy estimates the specific gravity of potassium at .6, so that it is the lightest fluid body known. In its solid form it is somewhat heavier; but, even in this state, when cooled to 40\u00b0 Fahrenheit, it swims in double distilled naphtha.\n\nWith the view of ascertaining the proportions of the constituent parts of potash, Mr Davy made two experiments, by subjecting the metallic base to combustion in oxygen gas. In the first experiment, .12 of a grain of potassium were employed; the combustion was made upon platinum, and was rapid and complete, and the base appeared to be perfectly saturated. The result of this experiment indicates 86.7 of base, and 13.3 of oxygen, in the 100 parts of potash. In another experiment, the result he obtained was 85.5 of base, and 14.5 of oxygen. The mean of these two experiments is 86.1 of base, and 13.9 of oxygen, in 100 parts of potash.\n\nThe results of the decomposition of water by the basis of the alkalies, which were more readily and perfectly obtained than those of their combustion, exhibited the proportion of base to be 84, and that of oxygen 16; but the mean of 86.1 of base, and 13.9 of oxygen, and 84 base and 16 oxygen, is 85 of potassium and 15 of oxygen, which may be taken as the proportions of the elements of potash.\n\nMr Davy's discoveries have been confirmed by the ingenious\ningenious experiments of Thenard and Gay-Lussac. These distinguished chemists have decomposed potash by a different process. They introduced iron filings into a bent gun barrel, which was placed across a furnace. A tube with a stopcock, containing a quantity of solid potash, is connected with one extremity of the gun barrel; to the other extremity there is attached a tube of safety, containing mercury, for the purpose of excluding the atmospheric air, and allowing any gaseous matter formed during the process to escape. The potash in the tube is to be kept cold by means of a freezing mixture, till that part of the barrel containing the iron filings has been raised to a white heat. The potash is then fused by applying heat, by means of a portable furnace; and it is allowed to pass through a small opening, to come in contact with the iron filings, where it is decomposed, the oxygen of the potash entering into combination with the iron, and the base passing on to the other extremity of the tube in a state of sublimation. At that extremity the metallic base is condensed by the application of excessive cold, and in this way the potassium may be obtained at less expense, and in greater quantity, than by means of galvanism. During this process, hydrogen gas is evolved, which, it is supposed, is owing to the decomposition of the water contained in the alkali. The potassium thus obtained is in the form of brilliant laminae, which adhere to the sides of the gun barrel. An alloy of the same metal with iron is also found in that part of the barrel containing the filings. Mr Davy has repeated this experiment, and he finds that the base obtained in this manner is heavier, and its melting point higher, than what is procured by means of galvanism. This, it is supposed, may arise from its being combined with a small proportion of iron. The metallic base of soda was obtained by a similar process.\n\nBut, according to the view which the French chemists have taken of these discoveries, and the results of their own experiments, they conclude, that the metallic substances derived from the alkalies are not simple, but are compounds of the several bases with hydrogen.\n\nAnother method of decomposing potash, and obtaining its base, which is still simpler, has been followed by Curaudau. In this process the decomposition is effected by charcoal. A mixture of carbonate of potash is made with flour or charcoal and linseed oil. This mixture is introduced into an iron or earthen tube or retort, and calcined, by gradually raising the heat, till a bluish light be seen in the inside of the vessel. Soon after an abundant evolution of vapour takes place, which is the base of the alkali, to be collected by introducing a clean iron rod, on which it condenses. Care must be taken to withdraw the rod before it is too hot, and to plunge it in oil of turpentine, under the surface of which the metallic crust on the rod may be separated. In this way a quantity of potassium may be procured. The base of soda is obtained by a similar process.\n\nFig. 3. is a representation of the apparatus employed by the French chemists in decomposing potash. ABCD is the gun barrel laid across the furnace, with its apparatus; D is the furnace, and F is the pipe of the bellows.\n\nFig. 4. is a section of the tube containing the potash.\n\nBut the chemical relations of potassium are not less extraordinary than its physical properties. It combines slowly with oxygen, and without flame, at all temperatures below that of its vaporization. At this point combustion takes place, with a brilliant white light, and intense heat. When it is heated slowly in a quantity of oxygen gas, which is not sufficient for its complete saturation, and at a temperature below that of inflammation, as for instance 400\u00b0 Fahrenheit, it changes to a red brown colour, and the solid form, consisting partly of potash, and partly of its base, is of a grayish colour. When exposed to water, or again heated in fresh quantities of air, the whole is converted into potash. When dry potash and potassium are fused together under proper circumstances, the base is deprived of its metallic splendour, and the two substances unite into a compound of a red brown colour when fluid, and of a dark gray when solid. This compound, when exposed to the air, soon absorbs its full proportion of oxygen, and is wholly converted into potash. The substance thus formed seems to be in a lower state of oxidation, so that it is to be considered as an oxide of potassium with a smaller proportion of oxygen.\n\nWhen potassium is introduced into oxyuric acid gas, it burns spontaneously with a bright red light, and a white salt is formed, which is nitrate of potash. When a globule of potassium is heated in hydrogen gas, at a degree below its point of vaporization, it seems to dissolve in it, for the globule is diminished in volume, and the gas explodes with alkaline fumes, and bright light, when brought into the air; but, by cooling, the potassium is wholly or principally deposited, for the gas is deprived of its property of spontaneous detonation.\n\nWhen potassium is thrown into water, it decomposes it with great violence; an instantaneous explosion, with brilliant flame, is produced, and a solution of pure potash is obtained. In these experiments, a white ring of smoke, gradually extending as it rises in the air, is produced, similar to the phenomenon of the combustion of phosphated hydrogen. When a globule of the basis of potash is placed upon ice, it instantly burns with a bright flame; part of the ice is melted, and in the cavity there is found a solution of potash.\n\nBy placing a globule of potassium upon moistened paper, tinged with turmeric, the moment that it comes in contact with the water, it burns, and, moving rapidly upon the paper, leaves behind it a deep reddish brown trace, thus demonstrating, in a very simple manner, the production of the alkali by the decomposition of water.\n\nPotassium readily decomposes the small quantities of water contained in alcohol and ether, even in their purest state. As potash is insoluble in ether, when the base is thrown into it, oxygen is furnished to it, and hydrogen gas evolved, and, as the alkali is formed, the ether becomes white and turbid. It is observed, that the energy of action of potassium in ether and alcohol, is proportional to the quantity of water which they contain, and hydrogen and potash are always produced.\n\nWhen potassium is thrown into solutions of the mineral acids, it inflames and burns on the surface, and when plunged, by proper means, beneath the surface enveloped in potash, surrounded by naphtha, it acts upon the oxygen with great intensity. In sulphuric acid, a white saline substance, covered with a yellow coating, which is supposed to be sulphate of potash surrounded with sulphur, and a gas, having the smell of sulphurous acid,\nZinc and which is probably a mixture of that substance with hydrogen gas, are formed. When potassium is thrown into nitrous acid, nitrate of potash is formed, and nitrous gas is disengaged.\n\nPotassium readily combines with phosphorus and sulphur. When placed upon a piece of phosphorus, they both become fluid, enter into combustion, and produce phosphate of potash. When the experiment is made upon naphtha, no gaseous substance is given out; the compound has the appearance of a metallic phosphuret, is of the colour of lead, and has the lustre of polished lead. Exposed to the air at common temperatures, it combines slowly with oxygen, and is converted into phosphate of potash. When heated upon a plate of platinum, it gives out fumes, but does not burn till it reaches the temperature of the rapid combustion of potassium.\n\nWhen potassium is brought into contact with sulphur in fusion, in tubes filled with the vapour of naphtha, they combine rapidly, with the evolution of heat and light. A grey substance is thus formed, which has the appearance of artificial sulphuret of iron; if it be kept in fusion, it rapidly dissolves the glass. When this experiment is made in a glass tube, hermetically sealed, no gas is disengaged, if the tube be opened under mercury; but when it is made in a tube connected with a mercurial apparatus, a small quantity of sulphured hydrogen is evolved. When the combination is effected in the atmosphere, a great inflammation takes place, and sulphuret of potash is formed, and by farther exposure to the air, it is at last converted into sulphate of potash.\n\nWhen one part of potassium is added to eight or ten of mercury, in bulk, at 60\u00b0 of Fahrenheit, they instantly unite, and form a sublimate like mercury in colour, but less coherent. When a globule is made to touch a globule of mercury about twice as large, they combine with considerable heat. The compound is fluid at the temperature of its formation, but, when cool, it becomes solid, with the appearance of silver. With the 1/8th of potassium to the weight of mercury, the amalgam is hard and brittle; but with one part of potassium, and 70 of mercury, it is soft and malleable. Exposed to the air, these compounds absorb oxygen, and deliquescent potash is formed; and in a few minutes the mercury is revived. A globule of the amalgam, thrown into water, decomposes it rapidly with a hissing noise; potash is formed; pure hydrogen is disengaged, and the mercury remains free. This amalgam dissolves all the metals, and even acts on iron and platinum.\n\nWhen potassium is heated with gold, silver, or copper, in a close vessel of pure glass, a rapid action is produced, and the compounds thrown into water effect its decomposition; potash is formed, and the metals are revived. Potassium forms an alloy with fusible metal, which has a higher point of fusion than the fusible metal itself.\n\nPotassium has little effect on colourless and recently distilled naphtha; but, in naphtha, exposed to the air, it is soon oxidated, and an alkali which unites with the naphtha into a brown soap that collects round the globule, is formed. Potassium acts slowly on the concrete oils, as tallow, spermaceti, and wax, even when heated; coaly matter is depolished, a little gas is evolved, and a soap is formed. On the fluid fixed oils the effects are similar, but take place more slowly. With the assistance of heat, volatile oils are rapidly decomposed by potassium; gas is evolved, and charcoal deposited.\n\nThe metallic oxides, when heated in contact with potassium, are readily reduced. When a small quantity of oxide of iron was heated with it, to a temperature approaching its point of distillation, a vivid action took place. Alkali, in grey metallic particles, which effervesced in muriatic acid, appeared. The oxides of lead and tin were revived more rapidly, and with potassium in excess, an alloy was formed with the revived metal.\n\nPotassium readily decomposes flint glass and green glass, by a gentle heat. The metallic oxides are reduced, and the alkali formed dissolves the glass. At a red heat, even the purest glass is acted on by potassium; the oxygen in the alkali of the glass seems to be divided between the potassium employed, and the potassium which is the base of the alkali in the glass, and thus effects an oxidation in the first degree.\n\nSoda.\u2014When pure soda was subjected in similar circumstances to the action of galvanism, similar results were obtained as from potash; but the decomposition required a more intense action in the battery, or it was necessary to have the alkali in thinner and smaller pieces. Potassium remained fluid at the temperature of the atmosphere, at the time of its production; but the base obtained from soda, which was fluid in the degree of heat of the alkali during its formation, became solid on cooling, and exhibited the lustre of silver. With a battery of 100 pairs of plates of six inches, in full activity, the decomposition of pieces of soda of about 15 or 20 grains in weight only could be effected; and it was necessary also that the distance between the wires should not exceed one-eighth or one-tenth of an inch. But when 250 pairs of plates were employed, highly charged for the decomposition of soda, the globules often burnt at the moment of their formation, and sometimes exploded and separated into smaller globules, which darted rapidly through the air, in a state of vivid combustion, producing a beautiful effect of continued jets of fire.\n\nWhen the metallic base which is obtained from soda, and which Mr Davy has denominated sodium, was exposed to oxygen, it was converted into soda; and when this process was conducted by strongly heating the base in a given portion of oxygen, a rapid combustion with a brilliant white flame was produced, and the metallic globule was converted into a white solid mass, which was found to be soda. The oxygen gas was absorbed during the operation, and nothing was given out which affected the purity of the residual air.\n\nThe theory of the decomposition of the alkalies is stated by Mr Davy in the following words. \"As in all decompositions of compound substances which I had previously examined, at the same time that combustible bases were developed at the negative surface in the electrical circuit, oxygen was produced, and evolved or carried into combination at the positive surface, it was reasonable to conclude, that this substance was generated in a similar manner by the electrical action of the alkali; and a number of experiments made above mercury, with the apparatus for excluding external air, proved that this was the case. When solid potash or soda, in its conducting state, was included in glass tubes, furnished with electrified platina wires, the new substances were...\"\nwere generated at the negative surfaces; the gas given out at the other surface proved, by the most delicate examination, to be pure oxygen; and, unless when excess of water was present, no gas was evolved from the negative surface.\n\nFor the purpose of determining the proportions of the elements of soda, Mr Davy made similar experiments to those by which he ascertained the proportions of the base and oxygen of potash. By subjecting sodium to combustion in oxygen gas, it appeared that 100 parts of soda are composed of 85 of metallic base, and 20 of oxygen; but the results of its oxidation by the decomposition of water, indicated the proportions to be 23 of oxygen, and 77 of base. By taking the mean proportions, obtained from the results of the two sets of experiments, the elements of soda may be eliminated at 78.5 of metallic base, and 21.5 of oxygen.\n\nSodium, which remains solid at common temperatures, is white and opaque; and examined under a film of naphtha, has the lustre and appearance of silver. It is very malleable, and softer than common metallic substances. With a slight pressure it spreads into thin leaves, and, a globule of one-tenth or one-twelfth of an inch in diameter, is easily spread over a surface of one-fourth of an inch; and different globules are easily made to adhere, and form one mass by strong pressure. This property of welding which belongs to iron and platinum at a white heat only, is not diminished when sodium is cooled to 32\u00b0 Fahrenheit.\n\nSodium, like potassium, is a conductor of electricity and heat, and small globules subjected to galvanism inflame and burn with bright explosions. Sodium sinks in naphtha of specific gravity .861; but by mixing perfectly about 12 parts of naphtha, and five of oil of sassafras, the sodium remains at rest in any part of the fluid. This makes its specific gravity = about .9348, water being taken as 1. The particles of sodium lose their cohesion at 120\u00b0 Fahrenheit. It becomes quite fluid at 180\u00b0, so that it readily fuses under boiling naphtha. The temperature at which it is volatilized is not ascertained, but it remains fixed in a state of ignition at the point of fusion of plate glass.\n\nThe chemical relations of sodium are analogous to those of potassium, but with some characteristic differences. Exposed to the atmosphere, it is immediately tarnished, and is gradually covered with a white crust, which is pure soda. It combines slowly with oxygen, and without any luminous appearance at common temperatures. When heated, the combination is more rapid, but no light is emitted till it acquire a temperature near that of ignition. The flame in oxygen gas is white, and it sends forth bright sparks, producing a very beautiful effect; in common air, the colour of the light is like that of the combustion of charcoal, but brighter. When sodium was heated in hydrogen gas, it seemed to have no action on it.\n\nSodium burns vividly in oxyacetic acid gas, giving out numerous sparks of a bright red colour; a saline matter is produced, which is muriate of soda. When sodium is thrown into water, it produces a violent effervescence with a loud hissing noise; it combines with the oxygen of the water to form soda, which is dissolved, and its hydrogen is disengaged. During the process there is no luminous appearance; but when sodium is thrown into hot water, a more violent decomposition takes place. A few scintillations are observed at the surface of the water, which is owing to small particles of the basis which are thrown out of the water, heated to such a degree as to burn in passing through the atmosphere. But when a globule of iodine is brought into contact with a small particle of water, or with moistened paper, the heat produced is usually sufficient for its combustion, as in this case there is no medium to carry off the heat rapidly.\n\nSodium produces similar effects with potassium when brought into contact with alcohol and ether. It acts with great energy on the strong acids; with nitrous acid it produces a vivid inflammation, and with muriatic and sulphuric acids, great heat, but no light, is generated. The effects of sodium and potassium on the fixed and volatile oils, and naphtha, are quite analogous; but the appearances of the saponaceous compounds are somewhat different, the combinations with sodium being of a darker colour, and apparently less soluble.\n\nSodium also exhibits two degrees of combination with oxygen; the first is of a deep brown colour, which is fluid when produced, and becomes a dark gray solid on cooling. By attracting oxygen from the air, or by the decomposition of the water, it is converted into soda.\n\nSodium forms compounds with sulphur and phosphorus. In close vessels filled with the vapour of naphtha, it enters into combination with sulphur, giving out during the process a vivid light and heat, and often attended with explosion, from the vaporization of a portion of sulphur, and the disengagement of sulphurated hydrogen gas. The sulphuret of sodium is of a deep gray colour. In its combination with phosphorus, the compound obtained has the appearance of lead, and by exposure to the air, or by being subjected to combustion, the phosphuret of sodium is converted into phosphate of soda.\n\nSodium forms compounds with the metals. In the proportion of one-fortieth with mercury, a compound is obtained, which is of the colour of silver, and remains solid; the combination is accompanied with considerable heat. Sodium forms an alloy with tin, without producing any change of colour, and it has some action upon lead and gold when heated; but in its state of alloy it is soon converted into soda, by exposure to the air, or by the action of water, which it decomposes with disengagement of hydrogen. The amalgam of mercury and sodium seems to be capable of forming triple compounds with some other metals; and it would appear that iron and platinum remain in combination with the mercury, after they are deprived of the sodium by exposure to the air. The same amalgam of sodium and mercury likewise forms combinations with sulphur; the triple compound thus obtained is of a dark gray colour.\n\nAmmonia.\u2014The chemical composition of ammonia has been many years considered as fully established; but in the course of Mr Davy's experiments on the decomposition of the fixed alkalies, it occurred to him that oxygen might also form one of the constituents of ammonia, and this he also proved by experiment. Charcoal carefully burnt, and deprived of moisture, was ignited by a galvanic battery of 250 pairs of plates of six and four inches square, in a small quantity of pure ammoniacal gas, confined over mercury. A great expansion of the gaseous matter took place, and the white sublimate\nZinc substance formed in the process collected on the sides of the glass tube. This matter effervesced in diluted muriatic acid, so that the product was probably carbonate of ammonia. A more decisive proof of ammonia containing oxygen as one of its elements, was obtained from another process. Very pure ammoniacal gas was passed over iron wire ignited in a platinum tube, and two curved glass tubes were so arranged as to be inserted into a freezing mixture, and through one of these tubes the gas entered into the platinum tube, to be conveyed through it by the other glass tube into an air-holder. The temperature of the air was 55\u00b0, and no sensible quantity of water was deposited in the cooled glass tube, which transmitted the unchanged ammonia. But after being exposed to heat, moisture was very perceptible, and the gas appeared in the air-holder densely clouded. This circumstance appeared to establish the formation of the water from the decomposition of ammonia during the process. But after the gas had been passed several times through the ignited tube, from one air-holder to the other, the iron wire was found superficially converted into oxide, and had increased in weight 1/60 of a grain. About four-tenths of a grain of water were collected from the cooled glass tubes by means of filtrating paper, and 33.8 cubic inches of gas were expanded into 55.3 cubic inches, and by detonation with oxygen it was found, that the hydrogen gas in these was to the nitrogen or azote as 3.2 to 1 in bulk.\n\nAmmonia was farther subjected to experiment by taking the electric spark in it. In experiments of this kind it was understood that it is resolved into hydrogen and azotic gases; but Mr Davy found, after observing several variations in the results, that the weight of the two gases obtained was less by about one-eleventh than the weight of the ammonia employed. He attributes this loss to the oxygen of the alkali, which had probably combined with the wires of platinum employed in the experiment, and had thus disappeared. From these experiments he estimates the proportion of oxygen in ammonia at not less than 7 or 8 parts in 100; and as the gases evolved may contain more water than the gas decomposed, the proportion may even be larger. By thus considering ammonia as a triple compound of azote, hydrogen, and oxygen, the phenomena of its production and decomposition admit of an easy explanation. In all cases in which ammonia is formed, oxygen exists along with its other elements, in the substances from the decomposition of which it is obtained. In the decomposition of ammonia, on the other hand, the oxygen, which forms one of its elements, may be abstracted by the substance employed in its decomposition, or it may enter into combination with portions of its hydrogen or azote.\n\nBut in the progress of investigating the nature of ammonia, to which the attention of chemical philosophers has been particularly directed, it appears that this alkali is analogous to the fixed alkalies in having a metallic base. The Swedish chemists Berzelius and Pontin placed mercury negatively electrified in the galvanic circle, in contact with solution of ammonia. By this action the mercury increased in volume, and after an expansion of four or five times its former dimensions, it became a soft solid. From this amalgam exposed to the air, mercury and ammonia are reproduced, with the absorption of oxygen; and when the amalgam is put into water it forms ammonia, with the evolution of hydrogen, and the re-appearance of the mercury in its metallic state. Mr Davy repeated this experiment, and he found that to produce an amalgam, from 50 or 60 grains of mercury, in contact with a saturated solution of ammonia, required a considerable time, and that this amalgam changed considerably, even in the short period that was necessary for removing it from the solution. Conceiving that the de-oxidation and combination with mercury might be more easily effected in its nascent state, he placed 50 grains of mercury in a cavity in muriate of ammonia. The muriate slightly moistened was placed on a plate of platinum, and connected with the positive side of a large galvanic battery. The mercury was made negative by means of a platinum wire; a strong effervescence, with much heat, immediately took place; the globule of mercury in a few minutes enlarged to five times its former dimensions. It had the appearance of amalgam of zinc. Metallic crystallizations shot from it as a centre round the body of salt. They had an arborecent appearance, often became coloured at their points of contact with the muriate, and when the connection was broken, rapidly disappeared, while ammoniacal fumes were given out, and the mercury was reproduced. With a piece of carbonate of ammonia, similar phenomena were exhibited. The amalgam was formed very rapidly; but when the galvanic action was powerful in this last case, a black matter appeared in the cavity, which was probably carbon, from the decomposition of the carbonic acid.\n\nMr Davy considering the strong attraction of potassium and sodium for oxygen, was led to examine whether they produced any effect in the amalgamation of ammonia, independent of electricity. With this view he united small portions of potassium and sodium with mercury, and brought them into contact with moistened muriate of ammonia. An amalgam was formed, which rapidly increased to five or seven times its volume, and the compound seemed to contain a larger proportion of ammoniacal base than that obtained by electricity. It appears, too, that a portion of the metallic base employed to effect the de-oxidation always remained in combination with the compound, so that it was not a pure amalgam. The following are the properties of the amalgam from ammonia, obtained by means of galvanism.\n\nWhen this amalgam is formed at the temperature of 70\u00b0 or 80\u00b0, it is in the state of a soft solid, of the consistence of butter; at 32\u00b0 it becomes firmer, and assumes a crystallized form, in which small facets appear, which seem to be cubical. The amalgam of potassium crystallizes in cubes, as beautiful, and in some cases as large, as those of bismuth. The specific gravity of the amalgam is less than three, water being one. When the amalgam is thrown into water, a quantity of hydrogen equal to half its bulk, is evolved, and the water becomes a weak solution of ammonia. The amalgam being confined in a given portion of air, the air increases in bulk, and the mercury is revived. Ammoniacal gas equal to 1\u00bd or 1\u00beths of the volume of the amalgam, is produced, and oxygen equal to one-seventh or one-eighth of the ammonia, disappears. When the amalgam is thrown into muriatic acid gas, it becomes instantly coated with muriate of ammonia, and a small portion of hydrogen is evolved. In sulphuric acid it becomes\nZinc becomes coated with sulphate of ammonia and sulphur.\n\nMr Davy attempted, by various methods, to preserve the amalgam, in the hope of submitting it to distillation, for the purpose of obtaining the metallic base of the ammonia, which was united to the mercury, in a separate form. But as it is extremely difficult to free mercury, after being once moistened entirely from water, he did not succeed in this attempt. In wiping the amalgam carefully with bibulous paper, part of the ammonia was regenerated, and in passing it through fine linen, with the view of separating the moisture, a complete decomposition was effected, and the mercury was revived.\n\nThe quantity of the base of ammonia combined with 60 grains of quicksilver, appears not to exceed $\\frac{1}{3}$ of a grain, and the quantity of oxygen required for this is not more than $\\frac{1}{250}$ of a grain of water, which might be supplied by merely breathing upon the amalgam. Mr Davy made various other experiments, with the view of ascertaining the nature and properties of the amalgam of ammonia; but for an account of these we must refer to the paper itself. And he observes, that the more these properties are considered, the more extraordinary will they appear. Mercury, by combination with about $\\frac{1}{250}$ of its weight of new matter, becomes solid, and yet has its specific gravity reduced from 13.5 to less than 3, retaining at the same time its metallic characters, its colour, lustre, opacity, and conducting powers, undiminished. Can it then be conceived, Mr Davy asks, that a substance which forms with mercury so perfect an amalgam, should not be metallic in its own nature? This substance he designates ammonium. On what then, it is farther asked, do the metallic properties of ammonium depend? Are hydrogen and nitrogen both metals in the gaseous state, at the usual temperature of the atmosphere; bodies of the same character, as zinc and mercury in the state of ignition? Or are these gases in their common form oxides which become metallized by de-oxidation? Or are they to be considered as simple bodies, not metallic in their own nature, but capable of composing a metal when deprived of oxygen, and becoming an alkali with the addition of oxygen?\n\nIn the farther prosecution of the experiments relative to the nature of ammonia, Mr Davy employed potassium. He brought ammonia into contact with about twice its weight of potassium at common temperatures; but excepting a slight diminution in the volume of the gas, and the metal losing its lustre and becoming white, no other effects were produced. The white crust when examined, proved to be potash, and a small portion of hydrogen was found in the ammonia, but not more than equal in volume to the metal. When the potassium was heated in the gas, by means of a spirit lamp applied to the bottom of the retort, (fig. 5.) the colour of the crust changed from white to bright azure, and gradually to bright blue, green, and dark olive. The crust and the metal then fused together. This process is attended with effervescence; and the crust passing off to the sides, exhibits the shining surface of the potassium. When heated a second time, it swells considerably, becomes porous, crystallized, and of a beautiful azure tint. A gas is evolved during this operation, which gives the same diminution by detonation with oxygen, as hydrogen, and ammonia disappears.\n\nIt has been observed that the proportion of ammonia which loses its elastic form, varies according as the gas employed contains more or less moisture. Thus, in ammonia saturated with water at 63\u00b0 Fahrenheit, potassium caused the disappearance of twelve and a half cubic inches of ammonia; but in ammonia deprived of moisture, by exposure for two days to potash that had been ignited, the same quantity of potassium occasioned the disappearance of 16 cubic inches; but whatever were the degrees of moisture of the gas, the quantity of hydrogen generated always appeared equal for equal quantities of metal; and according to the French chemists, the portions are stated to have been the same as would have resulted from the action of water upon potassium. But in Mr Davy's experiments, the proportions were rather less. In one, conducted with great care, eight grains of potassium generated, by their action upon water, eight and a half cubic inches of hydrogen gas; and eight grains of potassium from the same mats, by their operation upon ammonia, produced 8\u00bd cubic inches of hydrogen gas. This difference, although inconsiderable, Mr Davy found always to take place.\n\nIn Mr Davy's experiments on the action of potassium on ammonia, he employed retorts of plate glass. The potassium was fastened upon trays of platinum or iron, which were introduced into the glass retorts furnished with stop-cocks. The retorts were exhausted by an air-pump, then filled with hydrogen, exhausted a second time, and afterwards filled with ammonia. (See fig. 5, fig. 5, and 6.)\n\nThe following are the properties of the substance obtained from the action of ammonia on potassium. 1. It is crystallized, and presents irregular facets, which are extremely dark, and in colour and lustre not unlike the green oxide of iron; it is opaque when examined in large masses, but is semitransparent in thin films, and appears of a bright brown colour by transmitted light. 2. It is fusible at a heat a little above that of boiling water, and if heated much higher, emits globules of gas. 3. It appears to be considerably heavier than water, for it sinks rapidly in oil of saffron. 4. It is a non-conductor of electricity. 5. When it is melted in oxygen gas, it burns with great vivacity, emitting bright sparks. Oxygen is absorbed, nitrogen is emitted, and potash, which from its great fusibility seems to contain water, is formed. 6. When brought into contact with water, it acts upon it with much energy, produces heat, and often inflammation, and evolves ammonia. When thrown upon water, it disappears with a hissing noise, and globules from it often move in a state of ignition upon the surface of the water. It rapidly effervesces and deliquesces in air, but can be preserved under naphtha, in which, however, it softens slowly, and seems partially to dissolve. When it is plunged under water filling an inverted jar, by means of a proper tube, it instantly disappears with effervescence, and the non-absorbable elastic fluid liberated is found to be hydrogen gas.\n\nIt is found that the weight of this substance is greater than that of the potassium from which it is formed; and from this it is concluded, that part of the ammonia, or of its elements, enters into its composition. When this substance is decomposed by heat, nitrogen and hydrogen gases, with a portion of ammonia, are given out. It appears, however, that the production of the ammonia...\nZinc is in proportion to the moisture admitted, and when the moisture is considerable, the whole product is ammonia. When this substance is exposed to heat, a matter remains, which even by increasing the heat, is not farther changed. On this residuum water acts violently, and with effervescence, from the evolution of hydrogen gas. Ammonia and potash are at the same time reproduced.\n\nMr Davy's conclusion from these experiments is, that the substance formed by the action of ammonia on potassium is a compound of the latter with a small proportion of oxygen and nitrogen; and as it is found that the quantity of hydrogen given out during its formation is nearly equal to the hydrogen contained in the ammonia, it follows that neither hydrogen nor the ammonia itself can be supposed to enter into its composition.\n\nIn prosecuting this investigation, Mr Davy made various experiments, and whether the substance was acted on by water, exposed to the action of oxygen, or decomposed by heat, it was found, contrary to expectation, that the quantity of nitrogen evolved during its decomposition was much less than in proportion to the quantity of ammonia which had disappeared in its formation. In one experiment, in which the decomposition was effected by heat, the gaseous product was examined, and was found to be partly potash, and partly potassium; but it afforded no traces of ammonia, when acted on by water, which is a proof that it retained no nitrogen. In another experiment, 11 cubic inches of ammonia, or 2.05 grains, were decomposed by potassium. The product was 3.6 cubic inches of nitrogen, equal to 1.06 grain; 16 cubic inches of hydrogen, equal to .382 grain; and there was added to the potassium a quantity of oxygen equal to .6 grain. These products taken together amount to 2.04 grams, which is nearly equal to the quantity of ammonia employed; but this quantity of ammonia, if the proportions of its elements be eliminated, from its decomposition by electricity, would have yielded 5.5 cubic inches of nitrogen, equal to 1.6 grain, and only 14 cubic inches equal to .33; and allowing the separation of oxygen in this process in water, it cannot be eliminated at more than .11 or .12; and hence, if the analysis of ammonia by electricity come near to accuracy, there is in this process a considerable loss of nitrogen, and the production of oxygen and hydrogen.\n\nHow, says Mr Davy, can these extraordinary results be explained? The decomposition and composition of nitrogen seem proved, and one of its elements appears to be oxygen; but what is the other element? Is the gas that appears to possess the properties of hydrogen a new species of inflammable aeriform substance? Or has nitrogen a metallic basis, which alloys with the iron or platinum? Or is water alike the ponderable matter of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen? Or is nitrogen a compound of hydrogen, with a larger proportion of oxygen than exists in water? Of these important questions, Mr Davy adds, the two first seem the least likely to be answered in the affirmative, from the correspondence between the weight of the ammonia decomposed, and the products, supposing them to be known substances.\n\nIn concluding this subject, we must observe, that it still remains in a considerable degree of obscurity. It seems, however, to be ascertained, that the base of ammonia is of a metallic nature, which must be derived, either from the nitrogen or the hydrogen, or from both, or perhaps these substances are only different forms of combination of the elementary base. Or if nitrogen be supposed to be an oxide of hydrogen, then hydrogen in its gaseous form is either a metallic substance, or has a metallic base, which latter enters into combination with the mercury employed in the decomposition of ammonia.\n\nDecomposition of the Earths.\n\nFrom the results of the experiments on potash and soda, which Mr Davy obtained, he was led to entertain the strongest hopes of being able to effect the decomposition both of the alkaline and common earths; and the phenomena which took place in the first imperfect trials made upon these bodies countenanced the ideas, that had obtained since the earliest periods of chemistry, of their being metallic in their nature.\n\nThe earths, like the fixed alkalies, are non-conductors of electricity; but the fixed alkalies become conductors by fusion: the infusible nature of the earths, however, rendered it impossible to operate upon them in this state: the strong affinity of their bases for oxygen, made it unavailing, to act upon them in solution in water; and the only methods that proved successful, were those of operating upon them by electricity in some of their combinations, or of combining them at the moment of their decomposition by electricity in metallic alloys, so as to obtain evidences of their nature and properties. To render the experiments upon the earths satisfactory, a more powerful battery will be required, than Mr Davy has a prospect of seeing very soon constructed; he therefore prefers the imputation of having published unfinished labours, to that of having concealed any new facts.\n\nBarytes, fritonites, and lime, slightly moistened, were electrified by iron wires under naphtha, by the same methods, and with the same powers, as those employed for the decomposition of the fixed alkalies. In these cases gas was copiously evolved, which was inflammable; and the earths, where in contact with the negative metallic wires, became dark coloured and exhibited small points, having a metallic lustre, which, when exposed to air, gradually became white: they became white likewise when plunged under water; and when examined in this experiment with a magnifier, a greenish powder seemed to separate from them, and small globules of gas were disengaged.\n\nIn these experiments there was great reason to believe that the earths had been decomposed; and that their bases had combined with the iron, so as to form alloys decomposable by the oxygen of the air or water; but the indistinctness of the effect, and the complicated circumstances required for producing it, were such as to compel Mr Davy to form other plans of operation.\n\nMr Davy bearing in mind the strong attraction of potassium for oxygen, was induced to try whether this body might not detach the oxygen from the earths, in the same manner as charcoal decomposes the common metallic oxides. He heated potassium in contact with dry pure lime barytes, fritonites, and magnesia, in tubes of plate-glass; but as he was obliged to use very small quantities, and as he could not raise the heat to ignition without fusing the glass, he obtained no good results in this manner.\nThe potassium appeared to act upon the earths and on the glaas, and dark brown substances were obtained, which evolved gas from water; but no distinct metallic globules could be procured: from these, and other like circumstances, it seemed probable, that though potassium may partially deoxygenate the earths, yet its affinity for oxygen, at least at the temperature employed, is not sufficient to effect their decomposition. Mr Davy, having made mixtures of dry potash in excess and dry barytes, lime, strontites, and magnesia, brought them into fusion, and acted upon them in the galvanic circuit in the same manner as he employed for obtaining the metals of the alkalies. He expected that the potassium and the metals of the earths might be deoxygenated at the same time, and enter into combination in alloy.\n\nIn this way of operating, the results were more distinct than in the last: metallic substances appeared less fusible than potassium, which burned the instant after they had formed, and which by burning produced a mixture of potash and the earth employed. An attempt was made to form the metallic substances under naphtha, but without much success. To produce the result at all, required a charge by the action of nitric acid, which the state of the batteries would not often allow of; and the metal was generated only in very minute films, which could not be detached by fusion, and which were instantly destroyed by exposure to air.\n\nMr Davy had found in his researches upon potassium, that when a mixture of potash and the oxide of mercury, tin, or lead, was electrified in the galvanic circuit, the decomposition was very rapid, and an amalgam, or an alloy of potassium, was obtained; the attraction between the common metals and potassium apparently accelerating the separation of the oxygen. The idea that a similar kind of action might assist the decomposition of the alkaline earths, induced him to electrify mixtures of these bodies and the oxide of tin, of iron, of lead, of silver, and of mercury; and these operations were far more satisfactory than any of the others.\n\nA mixture of two-thirds of barytes, and one third of oxide of silver very slightly moistened, was electrified by iron wires; an effervescence took place at both points of contact, and a minute quantity of a substance, possessing the whiteness of silver, formed at the negative point. When the iron wire to which this substance adhered, was plunged into water containing a little alum in solution, gas was disengaged, which proved to be hydrogen; and white clouds, which were found to be sulphate of barytes, defended from the point of the wire.\n\nA mixture of barytes and red oxide of mercury, in the same proportions, was electrified in the same manner. A small mass of solid amalgam adhered to the negative wire, which evidently contained a substance, that produced barytes by exposure to the air, with the absorption of oxygen; and which occasioned the evolution of hydrogen from water, leaving pure mercury, and producing a solution of barytes.\n\nMixtures of lime, strontites, magnesia, and red oxide of mercury, treated in the same manner, gave similar amalgams, from which the alkaline earths were regenerated by the action of air or water, with like phenomena; but the quantities of metallic substances obtained were exceedingly minute; they appeared as mere superficial formations surrounding the point of the wire, nor did they increase after the first few minutes of electrification, even when the process was carried on for some hours.\n\nThese experiments were at first made when the batteries were in bad order; but were afterwards refitted with a new and much more powerful apparatus, constructed in the laboratory of the Royal Institution, and consisting of five hundred pairs of double plates of six inches square.\n\nWhen Mr Davy attempted to obtain amalgams with this apparatus, the transmitting wires being of platinum, of about $\\frac{1}{2}$ of an inch diameter, the heat generated was so great as to burn both the mercury and basis of the amalgam at the moment of its formation; and when, by extending the surfaces of the conductors, this power of ignition was modified, yet still the amalgam was only procured in thin films, and globules sufficiently large to submit to distillation could not be procured. When the transmitting wires were of iron of the same thickness, the iron acquired the temperature of ignition, and combined with the bases of the earths in preference to the mercury; and metallic alloys of a dark grey colour were obtained, which acted on water with the evolution of hydrogen, and were converted into oxide of iron and alkaline earths.\n\nWhile Mr Davy was engaged in these experiments, he received a letter from Professor Berzelius of Stockholm, who stated that in conjunction with Dr Pontin, he had succeeded in decomposing barytes and lime, by negatively electrifying mercury in contact with them, and that in this way he had obtained amalgams of the metals of these earths.\n\nMr Davy immediately repeated these operations with perfect success; a globule of mercury, electrified by the power of the battery of 500, weakly charged, was made to act upon a surface of slightly moistened barytes, fixed upon a plate of platinum. The mercury gradually became less fluid, and after a few minutes was found covered with a white film of barytes, and when the amalgam was thrown into water, hydrogen was disengaged, the mercury remained free, and a solution of barytes was formed.\n\nThe result with lime, as these gentlemen had stated, was precisely analogous. Strontites and magnesia were decomposed in the same manner.\n\nFrom strontites the expected result soon took place; but from magnesia, in the first trials, no amalgam could be procured. By continuing the process, however, for a longer time, and keeping the earth continually moist, at last a combination of the basis with mercury was obtained, which slowly produced magnesia by absorbing oxygen from the air, or by the action of water.\n\nMr Davy found that all these amalgams might be preserved for a considerable period under naphtha. In length of time, however, they became covered with a white crust under this fluid. In water, the amalgam of barytes was most rapidly decomposed; that of strontites and that of lime next in order; but the amalgam from magnesia, as might be expected from the weak affinity of the earth for water, very slowly changed. When a little sulphuric acid was added to the water, however, the evolution of hydrogen, and the production and solution of magnesia, were exceedingly rapid, and the mercury soon remained free.\n\nMr Davy believed, that one reason why magnesia was less easy to metallize, than the other alkaline earths, was...\nwas owing to its insolubility in water, which would prevent it from being present in the nascent state, detached from its solution at the negative surface.\n\nHe then made the experiment, using moistened sulphate of magnesia instead of the pure earth; and the amalgam was much sooner obtained. Here the magnesia was attracted from the sulphuric acid, and probably deoxygenated and combined with the quicksilver at the same instant.\n\nThe amalgams of the other bases of the alkaline earths could be obtained in the same manner from their saline compounds: muriate and sulphate of lime, the muriate of strontites and barytes, and nitrate of barytes, were decomposed by the same means as the other earths. The earths, separated at the deoxygenating surface, they seemed instantly to undergo decomposition, and, seized upon by the mercury, were in some measure defended from the action of air, and from the contact of water, and preserved by their strong attraction for this metal.\n\nIn attempting to procure the metals of the alkaline earths, the latter were slightly moistened, and mixed with one-third of red oxide of mercury; the mixture was placed on a plate of platinum; a cavity was made in the upper part of it to receive a globule of mercury, of from 50 to 60 grains in weight; the whole was covered by a film of naphtha, and the plate was made positive, and the mercury negative, by a proper communication with the battery of five hundred.\n\nThe amalgams obtained in this way were distilled in tubes of plate-glass, or in some cases in tubes of common glass. These tubes were bent in the middle, and the extremities were enlarged and rendered globular by blowing, so as to serve the purpose of a retort and receiver. The tube, after the amalgam had been introduced, was filled with naphtha, which was afterwards expelled, by boiling, through a small orifice in the end corresponding to the receiver, which was hermetically sealed when the tube contained nothing but the vapour of naphtha, and the amalgam. It was found immediately that the mercury rose pure by distillation from the amalgam, and it was very easy to separate a part of it; but to produce a complete decomposition was very difficult, as nearly a red heat was required for the purpose, and as at a red heat the bases of the earths instantly acted upon the glass, and became oxygenated. When the tube was large in proportion to the quantity of amalgam used, the vapour of the naphtha furnished oxygen sufficient to destroy part of the bases; and when a small tube was employed, it was difficult to heat the part used as a retort sufficient to drive off the whole of the mercury from the bases, without raising too highly the temperature of the part serving for the receiver, so as to burst the tube.\n\nIn consequence of these difficulties, in a multitude of trials, only a very few successful results were obtained; and in no case could our author be absolutely certain, that there was not a minute portion of mercury still in combination with the metals of the earths.\n\nIn the best result obtained from the distillation of the amalgam of barytes, the residuum appeared as a white metal, of the colour of silver. It was fixed at all common temperatures, but became fluid at a heat below redness, and did not rise in vapour when heated to redness, in a tube of plate-glass, but acted violently up-\n\non the glass, producing a black mass, which seemed to contain barytes, and a fixed alkaline basis, in the first degree of oxidation. When exposed to air, it rapidly tarnished, and fell into a white powder, which was barytes. When this process was conducted in a small portion of air, the oxygen was absorbed and the nitrogen remained unaltered; when a portion of it was introduced into water, it acted upon it with great violence and sunk to the bottom, producing in it barytes; and hydrogen was generated. From the minuteness of the quantities obtained, neither its physical nor chemical qualities could be examined correctly. It sunk rapidly in water, and even in sulphuric acid, though surrounded by globules of hydrogen, equal to two or three times its volume; from which it seems probable, that it cannot be less than four or five times as heavy as water. It flattened by pressure, but required a considerable force to produce this effect.\n\nThe metal from strontites sunk in sulphuric acid, and exhibited the same characters as that from barytes, except in producing strontites by oxidation.\n\nThe metal from lime, Mr Davy has never been able to examine, either when exposed to air, or when under naphtha. In the case in which he was able to distil the quicksilver from it to the greatest extent, the tube unfortunately broke, while warm, and at the moment that the air entered, the metal, which had the colour and lustre of silver, instantly took fire, and burned with an intense white light into quicklime.\n\nThe metal from magnesia seemed to act upon the glass, even before the whole of the quicksilver was distilled from it. In an experiment in which the process was stopped before the mercury was entirely driven off, it appeared as a solid; having the same whitening and lustre as the metals of the other earths. It sunk rapidly in water, though surrounded by globules of gas producing magnesia, and quickly changed in air, becoming covered with a white crust, and falling into a fine powder, which proved to be magnesia.\n\nIn several cases in which amalgams of the metals were obtained, containing only a small quantity of mercury, they were exposed to air on a delicate balance, and it was always found, that, during the conversion of metal into earth, there was a considerable increase of weight.\n\nMr Davy endeavoured to ascertain the proportions of oxygen and basis in barytes and strontites, by heating amalgams of them in tubes filled with oxygen, but without success. He satisfied himself, however, that when the metals of the earths were burned in a small quantity of air, they absorbed oxygen, gained weight in the process, and were in the highly caustic or unflaked state; for they produced strong heat by the contact of water, and did not effervescence during their solution in acids.\n\nThe evidence for the composition of the alkaline earths is then of the same kind as that for the composition of the common metallic oxides; and the principles of their decomposition are precisely similar, the inflammable matters in all cases separating at the negative surface in the galvanic circuit, and the oxygen at the positive surface.\n\nMr Davy has denominated the metals obtained from the alkaline earths, barium, strontium, calcium, and magnesium.\n\nIn attempting the decomposition of the other earths,\nMr Davy was less fortunate in obtaining distinct results; and he observes that the methods which have usually proved successful, as well as some others, failed. When alumina was subjected to the action of electricity, it was in a state of fusion with potash. In this process metallic globules were produced, but they consisted chiefly of the base of the alkali. Some appearances, however, showed, that the alumina itself was decomposed; for when soda was employed, the metallic product obtained was less fusible than sodium itself, and when it was acted on by water, it produced soda and a white powder. When potash was fused with the alumina, and subjected to galvanic action, the metallic product decomposed water with great rapidity, and the solution obtained depolished alumina by the action of an acid. When potassium in the state of amalgam, with one-third of mercury, in contact with alumina, was negatively electrified under naphtha, and after the process had been continued for some time, the amalgam was added to water, a decomposition took place, and a solution was obtained, which produced a cloudiness on the addition of an acid; but all these results are to be considered as very imperfect evidence of the decomposition of alumina.\n\nMr Davy was still less successful in attempting the decomposition of silica, partly from its insolubility, and partly from its being scarcely, if at all, affected with electricity, when dissolved in water, and placed in the galvanic circuit; but by following the same processes as in his experiments on alumina, some indications of decomposition appeared. When silica was fused with five parts of potash, and was placed in fusion in the galvanic circuit, metallic matter was obtained, from which, by exposure to the air, or by dropping it into water, a minute quantity of silica was reproduced. When potassium, amalgamated with one-third of mercury, and in contact with silica, was negatively electrified, he obtained a similar result; but in none of the experiments could the product obtained be considered as the pure base of the earth.\n\nThe earths of zirconia and glucina were also subjected to the action of galvanism, by processes similar to those which have now been described, and in both there were some indications of decomposition; but the results were not so perfect as to lead to any certain conclusion respecting their nature.\n\nDecomposition of Sulphur and Phosphorus.\n\nSulphur.\u2014Sulphur, which had formerly been considered as a simple substance, appears, from the experiments of some of the French chemists, and particularly those of Berthollet junior, to be a compound of sulphur and hydrogen. The latter chemist, in his experiments to investigate the nature of this substance, caused sulphur to pass through a coated glass tube, which was heated to whiteness; some indications of sulphurated hydrogen were obtained. He then formed metallic sulphurets, as of iron, copper, and mercury, and in these processes, which were performed in an earthen retort with great care, sulphurated hydrogen gas was also obtained. Water in the state of vapour being passed over sulphur in fusion, caused the evolution of sulphurated hydrogen; the water was not decomposed, for no trace of acid could be observed. It seemed only to have effected the disengagement of hydrogen from the sulphur.\n\nMr Davy, in the course of his experiments in galvanism, subjected sulphur to the action of that power. The sulphur which he employed was sublimed in a retort, filled with azotic gas, and it was kept hot till the commencement of the experiment. The reason of this preliminary process was, to avoid any uncertainty which might arise from water absorbed by the sulphur. The sulphur introduced into a curved tube, fig. 7, which was furnished with wires of platinum A and B, the upper wire being hermetically sealed into the end of the tube, was then placed in the galvanic circuit of a battery of 500 pairs of plates of six inches, in a state of great activity. A very intense action followed, accompanied by great heat and a brilliant light. The sulphur soon entered into ebullition, and gave out a great quantity of elastic fluid, a good deal of which was permanent. The sulphur itself assumed a deep red brown colour. The gas obtained was sulphurated hydrogen. In another experiment made on 200 grains of sulphur, the amount of sulphurated hydrogen obtained was equal to more than five times the volume of the sulphur. A considerable action was observed to have taken place on the wires of platinum; and the sulphur, at its point of contact with the wires, reddened moist litmus paper. When sulphur and potassium are heated together, a very powerful action takes place. Sulphurated hydrogen is disengaged with very intense heat and light. From these experiments the conclusion seems fair and obvious, that hydrogen exists in sulphur, for a substance, as Mr Davy observes, which can be produced from it in such abundance, is not to be considered merely as an accidental ingredient.\n\nBut as it is admitted that sulphurated hydrogen contains oxygen, Mr Davy contends that oxygen is to be regarded as one of the constituents of sulphur. In this opinion he is supported by experiment. He heated potassium in sulphurated hydrogen gas, from which moisture had been as much as possible abstracted, by muriate of lime. The potassium took fire, and burnt with a brilliant flame. When four grains of potassium were heated in 20 cubic inches of gas, the quantity of gas diminished only about 2\u00bd cubic inches; but the properties of the gas were totally changed. A small portion only of it was absorbed by water, and the remainder was hydrogen, holding in solution a minute portion of sulphur. Some sulphur was observed on the sides of the retort, and a solid matter was formed, which on the surface was of a red colour, like sulphuret of potash, but internally dark gray, like sulphuret of potassium. By subjecting this substance to the action of muriatic acid, sulphurated hydrogen gas was obtained, but the proportion was less than would have been given out, had the potassium been in combination with pure combustible matter. From this Mr Davy concludes, that there is a principle in sulphurated hydrogen which is capable of destroying partially the inflammability of potassium, and of producing upon it all the effects of oxygen. As sulphurated hydrogen is obtained by heating sulphur strongly in hydrogen gas, Mr Davy introduced four grains of sulphur in a glass retort, containing about 20 cubical inches of hydrogen, and by means of a spirit lamp, he raised the heat nearly to redness. No perceptible change took place in the volume of the gas after the process. The sublimed sulphur was unchanged in its properties, and about three cubical inches of unelastic fluid, absorbable by water, reddening litmus, and having all the properties of sulphurated hydrogen gas, were formed. Supposing then\nZinc, sulphurated hydrogen to be constituted by sulphur dissolved in its uncombined state in hydrogen, and admit the existence of oxygen in this gas, its existence must likewise be allowed in sulphur. From these experiments Mr Davy thinks it not unreasonable to assume, that sulphur in its common state is a compound of small quantities of oxygen and hydrogen, with a large quantity of a base, which produces the acids of sulphur in combustion; and as this base, it is added, possesses strong attractions for other bodies, it will probably be very difficult to obtain it in its uncombined state.\n\nSulphur combines readily with potassium, when brought into contact in tubes filled with the vapour of naphtha; heat and light are rapidly evolved during the combination, and a grey substance like artificial sulphuret of iron, is produced. The sulphurated hydrogen in small quantity is formed at the moment of combination, the hydrogen of which, it is supposed, is derived from the sulphur. The sulphuret of potassium readily inflames, and when exposed to the air, it is gradually oxidated, and converted into sulphate of potash.\n\nSulphur also enters into combination with sodium, accompanied also with the evolution of heat and light. An explosion sometimes takes place, which is owing to the volatilization of a portion of sulphur, and the disengagement of sulphurated hydrogen gas. The sulphuret of sodium is of a deep grey colour.\n\nPhosphorus.\u2014Mr Davy subjected phosphorus to similar experiments, and he found that the same analogies are applicable to this combustible. Common electrical sparks transmitted through phosphorus produce no evolution of permanent gas; but when acted upon by the same galvanic battery, and in the same circumstances as the sulphur, a considerable evolution of gas was effected, and the phosphorus became of a deep red brown colour. The gas was phosphorated hydrogen; and in an experiment continued for some hours, the quantity evolved was four times the volume of the phosphorus. The light by the galvanic spark was at first a brilliant yellow, and afterwards orange.\n\nThree grains of potassium were heated in 16 cubic inches of phosphorated hydrogen. As the fusion was effected, the retort was filled with white fumes, and a reddish substance was deposited upon the upper part and sides; the heat was applied for some minutes, but no inflammation took place. When the retort cooled, the absorption was less than a cubic inch; the potassium externally was of a deep brown, and internally of a lead colour. The residual gas seemed to contain in solution a little phosphorus, but it had not the property of spontaneous inflammation. While the phosphuret was acted upon over mercury by a solution of muriatic acid, it gave out only 1\u00bd cubic inch of phosphorated hydrogen.\n\nOne grain of potassium, and one of phosphorus, were fused together. In combining, a very vivid light and intense ignition were produced; \u2154 of a cubic inch of phosphorated hydrogen was evolved, and the phosphuret, with diluted muriatic acid over mercury, gave out \u2153 of a cubic inch of phosphorated hydrogen. In another experiment with one grain of potassium, and three of phosphorus, nearly one-fourth of a cubic inch of phosphorated hydrogen was obtained; but the compound yielded by muriatic acid, only \u2153 of a cubic inch.\n\nFrom these experiments it is concluded, that phosphorated hydrogen contains a minute proportion of oxygen, and consequently that the same element enters into the composition of phosphorus. The deficiency of phosphorated hydrogen in the last experiment can only be referred to the supply of oxygen to the potassium from the phosphorus; and the quantity of phosphorated hydrogen produced in the experiment with equal parts of potassium and phosphorus, is much less than could be expected, if the potassium and phosphorus consisted merely of pure combustible matter.\n\nMr Davy also instituted a set of interesting experiments on the states of the carbonaceous principle in plumbago, charcoal, and the diamond, and the results of these are detailed in the same memoir; but for an account of them we must refer to the paper itself.\n\nDecomposition of Boracic, Fluoric, and Muriatic acids.\n\nThe properties of boracic, fluoric, and muriatic acids, many of which are quite analogous to those of other acids whose elements have been discovered, have led chemists to conclude that oxygen is also the acidifying principle in the former; but the separate existence or nature of the base of these three acids was, till the late researches of galvanism were instituted, utterly unknown. The investigation of the nature of these substances has been prosecuted by Mr Davy, and some of the French chemists; and of their experiments we shall now give a very short account.\n\nBoracic acid.\u2014When boracic acid was moistened with water, and exposed between two surfaces of platinum, and then subjected to the battery of 500 plates, an olive brown matter formed on the negative surface, and, increasing in thickness, appeared at last almost black. This substance was permanent in water, but it dissolved and effervesced in warm nitrous acid. Heated to redness on the platinum, it burnt slowly, and gave off white fumes, which reddened moistened litmus paper. A black mass remained, which through a magnifier appeared vitreous, and seemed to contain a fixed acid. The inference drawn from this experiment is, that the acid was decomposed, and again by the latter process reproduced.\n\nWhen equal weights of potassium and boracic acid were heated together in a green glass tube, which had been exhausted, after being twice filled with hydrogen gas, an intense ignition, with vivid inflammation, where the potassium was in contact with the boracic acid, took place, even before the temperature approached near to a red heat. When the acid had been heated to whiteness, before being introduced into the tube, and powdered and used while yet warm, the quantity of gas which was hydrogen, given out in the operation, did not exceed twice the volume of the acid. In this mode of conducting the experiment, 12 or 14 grains of each of the two substances only could be employed, on account of the intense heat and consequent fusion of the glass tube with larger proportions. Mr Davy found in several experiments, in which he employed equal parts of acid and potassium, that a great proportion of the former remained undecomposed, and he ascertained that twenty grains of potassium had their inflammability destroyed by eight grams of boracic acid.\n\nTo collect the substances formed in the process, metallic tubes with stop-cocks, and exhausted, after being filled with hydrogen, were employed. With tubes of brass or copper, a dull red heat only, but with iron tubes,\nZinc tubes, a white heat was applied; and in all cases the acid was decomposed with the same results. The substance obtained from the iron tube was in some parts of a dark olive colour, and in others almost black. It did not effervescence with warm water, but was rapidly acted upon by it. The solutions obtained consisted of subcarbonate of potash, and potash.\n\nThe following are the properties of the substance obtained in the decomposition of boracic acid by means of processes conducted in brass tubes, which afforded it in largest proportion. To this substance Mr Davy has given the name of boracium, which, as it is produced in the manner now described, is in the form of a pulverulent mass of the darkest shades of olive; it is opaque, very friable; the powder does not scratch glass, and is a non-conductor of electricity. Dried at 100\u00b0 or 120\u00b0, it gives off moisture, by decreasing the temperature; and when heated in the atmosphere, takes fire at a temperature below the boiling point of olive oil, emitting a red light, and sparks like charcoal. When excluded from air, and subjected to a white heat in a platinum tube, exhausted after being filled with hydrogen, it remains unchanged, excepting in becoming a little darker, and acquiring a greater specific gravity.\n\nBoracium introduced into a retort filled with oxygen gas, and heated by a spirit lamp, throws off vivid incandescence like that of the combustion of the bark of charcoal, and the mass gives out a brilliant light. A sublimate appears, which is boracic acid; it becomes coated with a vitreous substance, which is also found to be the same acid. When this is washed off, the black residue requires a greater heat, but it is also inflamed, and converted into boracic acid. When boracium is brought into contact with oxymuriatic acid gas, at common temperatures, it immediately takes fire, and burns with a brilliant white light, coating the inside of the vessel with a white substance, which is boracic acid. Boracium heated to redness with hydrogen or nitrogen, became of a darker colour, and gave out a little moisture, but remained otherwise unchanged. Thrown into concentrated nitric acid, it rendered it bright red; nitrous gas was produced and absorbed, but no rapid solution took place till the acid was heated, when the boracium disappeared with effervescence, and the evolution of nitrous gas, and the fluid yielded boracic acid. The action of boracium on sulphuric and muriatic acids was not remarkable. It combined with the fixed alkalies, both by fusion and aqueous solution, and formed pale olive-coloured compounds, which by muriatic acid were precipitated of a dark colour. When fused with sulphur, it dissolved slowly, and the sulphur became of an olive colour. Its action with phosphorus in the same circumstances was still feebler, but it communicated a shade of pale green.\n\nFrom the experiments now detailed, it appears that boracium obtained by means of potassium, is different from any other known species of matter, and seems to be the same as that obtained from boracic acid by electricity. According to the result of experiments made by Mr Davy, boracic acid is composed of one part of boracium, and about 1.8 of oxygen; and supposing the dark residual substance to be an oxide, it consists of 4.7 of boracium, and 1.55 of oxygen.\n\nFor an account of the experiments of Gay Lussac and Thenard, in investigating the nature of boracic acid, see Jour. de Physique, tom. lxvii. or Nichol. Jour. xxiii. 260.\n\nFluoric acid.\u2014According to the experiments of Mr Davy, potassium, when heated in fluoric acid gas, undergoes combustion, and a great absorption of the gas takes place. In other experiments he found, that when fluoric acid gas, procured in contact with glass, is introduced into a plate glass retort, exhausted after being filled with hydrogen gas, white fumes appear from the action of the potassium, which loses its splendour, and becomes coloured with a gray crust. The fumes are more copious when the bottom of the retort is gently heated. The volume of the gas examined at this time appears to be a little increased, with the addition of hydrogen; and when the temperature is raised nearly to the point of sublimation of the potassium, the metal rises through the crust, becomes first of a copper colour, and then inflames and burns with a brilliant red light. After this combustion, the fluoric acid is either wholly or partially destroyed, according as the quantity of potassium is great or small; and a mass of a chocolate colour is found in the bottom of the retort; the sides and the top are lined with a sublimate, which is partly chocolate, and partly of a yellow colour. When the residual gas is washed with water, mixed with oxygen gas, and exposed to the action of an electrical spark, it detonates, and affords a diminution in the same way as hydrogen gas.\n\nIn one experiment with 19 cubic inches of fluoric acid gas, and ten grains and a half of potassium, 14 cubic inches of the gas disappeared, and about two and a quarter of hydrogen gas were produced. The gas had not been artificially dried; little sublimate was produced, but the whole of the bottom of the retort was covered with a brown crust. When this mass was examined with a magnifier, it seemed to consist of different kinds of matter. It did not conduct electricity; it effervesced violently in water, with the evolution of an inflammable gas, which had somewhat of the odour of phosphorated hydrogen. Part of the mass heated in the air burnt slowly, and was converted into a white saline matter. It also burnt with difficulty in heated oxygen gas, but it absorbed a portion that required nearly a red heat. The light emitted resembled that from the combustion of liver of sulphur. Chocolate coloured particles were found floating in the water, acted on by a portion of the mass, and when the solid matter was separated by the filter, the fluid was found to contain fluorate of potash and potash. The solid residuum was heated in a small glass retort filled with oxygen gas; it burnt before reaching a red heat, and became white. Oxygen was absorbed, and acid matter produced. The remainder had the properties of the substance formed from fluoric acid gas, holding siliceous earth in solution by the action of water.\n\n\"The decomposition of the fluoric acid, Mr Davy observes, by potassium, seems analogous to that of the acids of sulphur and phosphorus. In neither of these cases are the pure bases, or even the bases in their common form, evolved; but new compounds result, and in one case, sulphurets and sulphites, and in the other phosphurets and phosphites of potash, are generated.\"\n\nIn another experiment Mr Davy attempted the decomposition of fluoric acid gas, which was perfectly dry, and free from siliceous earth, by mixing 100 grs.\nof dry boracic acid, and 200 grains of fluor spar. The mixture was introduced into the bottom of an iron tube, having a stop-cock and tube of safety attached. The tube was inserted horizontally in a forge, and 20 grains of potassium in an iron tray were placed in that part of it where the heat was only of a dull red. The bottom of the tube was raised to a white heat, and the acid, as it was generated, was acted upon by the heated potassium. The result obtained was a sublimate in some parts black, and in others of a dark brown colour. It did not effervescence with water, and when lixiviated, afforded a dark brown combustible mass which did not conduct electricity, and, when burnt in oxygen gas, afforded boracic and fluoric acids. This sublimate did not inflame spontaneously in oxyuratic acid gas; but it effervesced violently, and dissolved in nitric acid. Mr Davy thinks that this sublimate is a compound of the olive-coloured oxide of boracic acid, and an oxide of the base of fluoric acid; but he had not examined its properties particularly.\n\nMuriatic acid.\u2014Many conjectures have been offered with regard to the nature and constitution of muriatic acid, and many attempts have been made to effect its decomposition. Mr Davy has extended his researches to this sublimate, and has prosecuted the investigation with his usual ardour. It is still, however, to be regretted, that his success has not been commensurate with his ingenuity and industry. Some have supposed, that the base of muriatic acid is hydrogen, while others contend that the base is a compound of hydrogen and nitrogen.\n\nThe result of Mr Davy's first experiments in this inquiry showed, that the water alone in combination with the muriatic acid is decomposed, and that this elastic fluid contains a larger proportion of water than is usually suspected; and from various experiments he concludes, that muriatic acid gas, in its common state, is combined with at least one-third of its weight of water. In the prosecution of his researches, therefore, his object was to obtain the muriatic acid free from water. With this view he heated dry muriate of lime, mixed both with phosphoric acid, and dry boracic acid, in tubes of porcelain and of iron, and employed the blast of an excellent forge; but by none of these methods was any gas obtained, till a little moisture was added to the mixture, and then muriatic acid was given out in such quantity as almost to produce explosions. In distilling the liquor of Libavius, or the fuming muriate of tin, which contains dry muriatic acid, with sulphur and with phosphorus, no separation of the acid took place; but with the addition of water, muriatic acid gas was evolved with great heat and violence. By distilling mixtures of corrosive sublimate and sulphur, and of calomel and sulphur in their common states, muriatic acid gas was evolved; but when these substances were dried by a gentle heat, the quantity of gas obtained was greatly diminished. Mr Davy, and also the French chemists, endeavoured to procure dry muriatic acid by the distillation of a mixture of calomel and phosphorus. The result obtained is considered as a compound of muriatic acid, phosphorus, and oxygen. In Mr Davy's experiments, the product was more copious when corrosive sublimate was employed. With the same view of procuring dry muriatic acid gas, he exposed phosphorus to the action of oxyuratic acid gas, in the hope that in the oxidation of the phosphorus, the whole of the moisture would be absorbed; but the examination of the result showed, that no muriatic acid gas had been evolved during the process, so that the muriatic acid which had disappeared, must exist, either in the white sublimate which had collected in the top of the retort, or in a limpid fluid which had formed in its neck. When the sublimate was exposed to the air, it emitted fumes of muriatic acid, and when brought into contact with water, muriatic acid gas was evolved, and phosphoric and muriatic acids remained in solution in the water. Mr Davy regards this white sublimate as a combination of phosphoric and muriatic acids in their dry states. The limpid fluid was of a pale greenish yellow colour; it rapidly disappeared on exposure to the air, emitting dense white fumes, which had a strong smell, differing a little from that of muriatic acid. Mr Davy thinks that this is a compound of phosphoric and muriatic acids, both free from water.\n\nMr Davy made other experiments, for the purpose of procuring muriatic acid in its uncombined state, but with no better success. He then tried the effects of potassium introduced into the fluid generated by the action of phosphorus on corrosive sublimate; but such was the violent action of the substances operated upon, that the apparatus was generally destroyed, and he was thus precluded from examining the results. But for a particular detail of the experiments, we must refer to the memoir itself; and for the extended account of Mr Davy's investigations on this curious and interesting subject, of which we have given as comprehensive a view as our limits would permit, see Phil. Trans. 1807, 1808, and 1809.","sp":479,"ep":497},{"h":"ZINNIA","t":"a genus of plants of the class Syngenesia, and in the natural system arranged under the 49th order, Compositae.

He accordingly purchased an estate at Bertholdorff in Upper Lusatia, where, being joined by some followers, he gave the curacy of the village to a person of his own complexion; and Bertholdorff soon became talked of for a new mode of piety. One Christian David, a carpenter, brought a few profylites from Moravia: they began a new town about half a league from the village, where Count Zinzendorff fixed his residence among them, and whither great numbers of Moravians flocked and established themselves under his protection; so that in 1732 their number amounted to 600. An adjacent hill, called the Huthberg, gave occasion to these colonists to call their new settlement Huth des Herrn, and afterwards Herrnhuth; which may be interpreted \"The guard or protection of the Lord:\" and from this the whole sect have taken their name. The count spared neither pains nor art to propagate his opinions; he went himself all over Europe, and at least twice to America; and sent missionaries throughout the world.

The name Zoophytes, Zoophyta (i.e., animal plants, from \u03b6\u03c9\u03bf\u03c2, animal, and \u03c6\u03c5\u03c4\u03b1, plant), has been long appropriated to a numerous assemblage of marine or aqueous productions, which have puzzled the ingenuity of naturalists to ascertain their place in the chain of nature's works, and which have been alternately ranked among vegetable and animal, and sometimes even among mineral substances. At length, however, they seem, by general consent, to have been configned over to the animal kingdom, and, with the addition of several tribes from the Linnaean orders of Intestina, Molusca, and Infusoria, have, by Cuvier and his colleagues of the French school, been elevated to the rank of a separate class. See Helminthology, No. II.\n\nIn the Linnaean system, the zoophytes of earlier modern naturalists constitute the 4th order of the class Vermes, and as such have been enumerated under Helminthology; but, as the circumscribed limits of that article did not admit of our describing or figuring many species, we shall now so far as possible supply that deficiency by selecting a few of the most curious or interesting species of the Linnaean zoophytes; and we shall take this opportunity of making a few observations on some of the genera to which they belong.\n\nFigs. 1. and 2. represent the Tubipora musica, crimson tubipore, or organ coral; one of the most elegant of these singular productions. This species is distinguished from its congeners by having the tubes connected into fascicules or bundles, and separated from each other by transverse membranous partitions. The whole mass consists of upright parallel tubes, rising over each other by stages, something like the cells of a honeycomb. These tubes vary in height from half an inch to an inch; and are from one-tenth to one-eighth of an inch in diameter. Examined internally, they appear to contain a smaller tube divided at certain distances by radiated partitions (see fig. 2.), by means of which the transverse septa sometimes communicate with each other. These trans-\n\nverse septa are of unequal heights. The colour of the mass Zoophyte is a deep purple, or a rich crimson. The size of the mass varies considerably; but specimens have been obtained of from a foot to three feet in diameter. It is found abundantly in the Pacific ocean, and on the shores of some of the islands in the Indian sea.\n\nIn its recent state it is covered with a mucous or gelatinous substance, which pervades the whole mass and enters within each tube. The inhabiting animal is not certainly ascertained, but seems to be allied to the nereis tribe.\n\nFigs. 3. and 4. exhibit two views of the Madrepora fungites, or mushroom madreporite. This body fungites exactly resembles a mushroom, that it has very common Fig. 3. & 4. ly been regarded as that vegetable in a state of petrifaction; but recent observations seem to prove that it is formed by small animals like medusae. The convex side of this madreporite is conical, sometimes obtusely pointed, and exhibits on its surface those stellate pores which form the distinguishing character of the genus, while the concave surface is divided into numerous radiated furrows so as to represent the gills of a mushroom. When first obtained, it is of a delicate white colour, especially on the concave part, but it soon acquires a brown or yellowish tinge. It is found of various sizes, from an inch to five inches in diameter. It is met with chiefly in the Indian ocean and Red sea.\n\nAt fig. 5. is represented that elegant coral called by Isis hippocampus, the black and white jointed coral of Ellis. The specific character of this coral is that it is composed of white striated joints united by black junctures; but this structure is not visible till after the coral has been freed from a whitish soft fleshy part, with which the branches are covered in their natural state. See fig. 6. It is found chiefly in the Indian seas, and varies in height from a few inches to nearly two feet.\n\nFig. 7. represents the Antipathes myrophylla, var. Antipathes row antipathor, or sea-garrow, of its natural size; while myophy-\n\nPlate DLXXXIX.\n\nThis is one of those zoophytes which in their habit and appearance almost exactly resemble some of the vegetable tribes, and hence have received the names of sea-fern, sea-cypress, sea-fennel, &c. From their colour they are usually denominated black coral. This species, though one of the smallest, is not the least elegant of the tribe. It consists of numerous branches, composed of very slender pinnae arranged in no certain order. The whole coral is seldom above a foot in height, and rough on its outer surface. This also is a native of the Indian ocean, being found more especially on the coasts of the Molucca islands, and is sometimes met with in the Great South sea.\n\nFig. 9. exhibits a specimen of red coral, the Isis nobilis, Gorgonia lis of Linn\u00e9, and Gorgonia nobilis of later naturalists. This substance, though now nearly exploded from our cabinets for its intrinsic beauty and elegant appearance; but when examined on its native beds, or soon after being fished up, it shews a very different surface from that under which we usually see it. Fig. 9. represents it as prepared for sale by being deprived of its fleety animal bark or coating, but retaining the striated appearance which marks its specific character; but fig. 10. exhibits a piece of it in its natural state, with polypes extruded from the fleety coat, and shewing still more distinctly at the extremities the streaks below.\nRed coral is found in large beds or reefs in several parts of the Mediterranean sea, and coral fisheries are established on the coasts and near the islands. A fishery of this kind in the straits of Messina is minutely described by Spallanzani in his *Travels in the two Sicilies*, vol. iv. To tear the coral from the rocks they make use of a machine composed of two beams tied across each other, and furnished with a leaden weight to sink them, and a quantity of loose hemp and several strong nets to entangle the branches of the coral. To this machine is attached a strong rope, which is held by the fishers, and serves both to direct the net and to draw it up when the coral is entangled. Several boats go in company, each containing eight men, and the fishery lasts from April to July. The quantity collected every year amounts on an average to twelve Sicilian quintals, each equal to 250 pounds Troy, and each pound usually sells for about four shillings and sixpence. They do not fish on the same bank oftener than once in ten years, as this time is deemed necessary for the coral to acquire its full size and vigour.\n\nAnother beautiful species of gorgonia, the *Gorgonia ceratophyta*, is figured at fig. 11. This is distinguished by its dichotomous flat-tipped stem, and ascending branches. The outer flesh is of a purplish colour, and the branches are furnished with two rows of scattered pores from which the polypi appear. It is found in the Mediterranean, and sometimes on the eastern coasts of America.\n\nNearly allied to the gorgonias is the species of alcyonium represented at fig. 12. This is the *Alcyonium gorgonoides* of Gmelin. It is of a cinereous colour, of a sandy flecky consistence, having radiated warty cellules. It is found on the northern coast of South America, especially near the island of Cura\u00e7oa.\n\nThe zoophytes which naturalists distinguish by the generic name alcyonium, sometimes form independent bodies of a rounded form, such as those called the *sea-orange*, *sea-fish*, &c.; or cover the surface of shells and other marine bodies like a kind of bark. Their internal part or base is friable, and, when dried, appears to be composed of fine fibres, which are either longitudinal, as in the present case, diverging, or circular. This base is covered with a soft crust, that in drying assumes a leathery consistence, and is pierced with numerous little cells inhabited by polypi. In some species these cells are dispersed over the whole surface of the coral, while in others they are confined to particular spots or tubercles. They are all inhabitants of the ocean, where they are usually fixed to rocks or other solid bodies.\n\nIn the article *Helminthology* we have sufficiently treated of the nature and properties of the sponges, and have there mentioned particularly the common or *official sponge*. At fig. 13, is represented a more curious species, the *Sp. tubulosa* or *filifera*, the tubular or pipey sponge. This consists of simple upright, attenuated, rigid tubes, tuberculated on the outer surface, which is of a black colour. It is found in the seas that wash the coasts of America.\n\nThe *filiferae* are a tribe of insignificant zoophytes, which seem scarcely entitled to the rank which they hold in the animal creation. They are formed of a congeries of superficial cells, placed close together, like those of a honeycomb, but generally occupying only a single surface. Sometimes this substance forms a coating to some other marine body, at others it is unattached and forms a floating foliaceous mass or mat. The species represented at fig. 14, is one of the most curious, and is described by Ellis under the name of *English sea-mat*, called in the *Linnaean Transactions*, vol. v. *Flustra arenosa*. It is composed of sandy particles agglutinated together with slime, and in shape resembles the fore part of a horse's hoof. It is very friable, and so thin as to be easily broken. These *filiferae* are found abundantly on the coast of Kent, and about Holy-head on the Welsh coast.\n\nFig. 15 represents a specimen of *Sertularia fetacea*, *Sertularia* the small sea-bristle coralline of Ellis, of its natural size; *fetacea*, and fig. 16 shows the same specimen considerably magnified. This species is distinguished by being simply pinnated, with bent alternate pinnae, furnished with very remote processes growing only on one side, and oblong axillary ovaries. It is one of the smallest and most delicate of the tribe, seldom exceeding an inch and a half in height. It is very common, and is found on the British coasts.\n\nNone of the zoophytes bear a nearer resemblance to vegetables than the *fertulariae*. Their creeping roots, their branched stem, and tufts of feeming flowers (the polypine processes) give them all the air of plants. Hence they were long considered as *sea-mats*, and described by botanists under that name. See Ray's *Synopsis*, p. 38, and 39. When attentively examined, however, their animal nature will scarcely be disputed. Externally they are composed of a horny substance, perfectly transparent, and through this may be distinguished the animal substance traversing the centre of the stem and branches like the pith of a plant, and appearing externally as little knots or protuberances in the form of tentaculated polypes. These extraneous polypes are considered by Cuvier, (*Tableau Elementaire*, p. 768.) not as distinct animals, but only as parts of the same animal which constitutes the sole inhabitant of the *fertulariae*. These zoophytes adhere to rocks, shells, &c., by creeping roots, and appear to propagate by means of eggs. They are among the most common of this class of animated beings.\n\nThe *Pennatul\u00e6* or *Sea-pens* constitute a very curious tribe of zoophytes, which are completely locomotive, and swim in the manner of fishes. They consist of Fig. 17, an internal bone or rather horny substance, covered with a sensitive flecky coat. Their lower extremity is simple like the barrel of a quill, while the upper extremity is expanded into a flattened part, that is generally composed of pinnae like the barbs of a quill, though it is sometimes merely a simple expanded mass furnished with polypine processes.\n\nFig. 17 represents one of the most common *sea-pens* properly so called, the *Pennatula phosphorea*, phosphorescent pennatula, of its natural size. It has a flecky stem, a rough middle part, and imbricated pinnae. The pinnae are furnished on one side with lesser pinnae, at the extremities of which appear the polypes. See fig. 18, which shows one of the separate pinnae, a little magnified. This species is of a fine red or light scarlet colour, and when alive exhibits a strong phosphorescent light, so as to render distinctly visible objects that are near it. It is pretty common on the coasts of Britain, and is sometimes taken in the fisherman's nets, or adhering to the baits.\n\nFor figures of two other Linnaean zoophytes, the *Tubularia magnifica*, and *Hydra viridis*, see Plate CCLIII.","sp":499,"ep":500},{"h":"ZOOTOMY","t":"the art of defining animals or living creatures, being the same with anatomy.

Some have maintained that there was but one Zoroaster, and that he was a Persian; others have said that there were six eminent founders of philosophy of this name. Ham the son of Noah, Moses, Osiris, Mithras, and others, both gods and men, have by different writers been asserted to have been the same with Zoroaster. Many different opinions have also been advanced concerning the time in which he flourished. Aristotle and Pliny fix his date at so remote a period as 6000 years before the death of Plato. According to Laertius, he flourished 600 years before the Trojan war; according to Suidas, 500. If, in the midst of so much uncertainty, anything can be advanced with the appearance of probability, it seems to be this; that there was a Zoroaster, a Perseus-Median, who flourished about the time of Darius Hystaspes; and that besides him there was another Zoroaster, who lived in a much more remote period among the Babylonians, and taught them astronomy. The Greek and Arabian writers are agreed concerning the existence of the Persian Zoroaster; and the ancients unanimously ascribe to a philosopher, whom they call Zoroaster, the origin of the Chaldean astronomy, which is certainly of much earlier date than the time of Hystaspes: it seems, therefore, necessary to suppose a Chaldean Zoroaster distinct from the Persian. Concerning this Zoroaster, however, nothing more is known, than that he flourished towards the beginning of the Babylonian empire, and was the father of the Chaldean astrology and magic. All the writings that have been ascribed to Zoroaster are unquestionably spurious.","sp":507,"ep":507},{"h":"ZOSIMUS","t":"an ancient historian who lived at the end of the fourth and beginning of the fifth century.

It is not above 12 miles either way; but very populous and fruitful, yielding wine, wheat, chestnuts, and other fruits, in its vales, and excellent pasture on its mountains. The inhabitants of this canton are staunch Roman Catholics. It lies in the diocese of Constance, and its government is democratical. There are two lakes in it abounding in fish, particularly large carps, pikes, and a species of trouts called roelts; as well as several woods full of game. Zug, which gives name to it, and is its capital, stands on the east side of a lake of the same name, about seven miles long, and is a strong neat town, containing a priory and two convents.","sp":507,"ep":507},{"h":"ZUGMA","t":"a figure in Grammar, whereby an adjective or verb which agrees with a nearer word, is also, by way of supplement, referred to another more remote.","sp":478,"ep":478},{"h":"ZUILA","t":"a town in the territory of Fezzan, in Africa, which stands on a space of about a mile in circuit, but was formerly of much greater extent.

While he officiated as preacher at Zurich, a Franciscan fent by Leo X. came to publish indulgences there; against which Zuinglius, after the example of Luther, declaimed powerfully. In the course of this opposition he started a new doctrine, which he called Evangelical Truth; and from the beginning of 1519 to 1523, he preached not only against indulgences, but against other articles of the Romish church. But though Zuinglius made no less progress than Luther, he conducted himself with more moderation and prudence; and wishing to have the concurrence of the civil powers, procured two assemblies to be called at Zurich: by the first, he was authorized to proceed as he had begun; and by the second, the outward worship and ceremonies of the church of Rome were abolished. During these transactions, Zuinglius published several books in defence of his doctrines; but treating of the eucharist, and prescribing a form of celebrating the Lord's Supper different from Luther, he was involved in violent disputes with the rest of his reforming brethren. Respecting the divine decrees, the opinion of Zuinglius and his followers differed very little from that of the Pelagians: and instead of declaring with Calvin, that the church is a separate independent body, vested with the right of legislation for itself, Zuinglius ascribed to the civil magistrate an absolute and unbounded power in religious matters, allowing at the same time a certain subordination among the ministers of the church. This was abundantly agreeable to the magistrates of Zurich; but the rest of the Swiss cantons disallowing of their proceedings, other assemblies were called, and things tending to tumult, both sides had recourse to arms; when Zuinglius, who began as a preacher, died in arms as a soldier, in 1531. His works are in four volumes folio.","sp":507,"ep":507},{"h":"ZURICH","t":"a canton of Switzerland, bounded to the north by Swabia and the canton of Schaffhausen; to the south by the town and territory of Rapperachweil and the cantons of Switz and Zug; to the east by the Thurgau, Toggenburg, and Utznach; and to the west by the free bailiages and county of Baden. It is about 60 miles from north to south, and 48 from east to west. With respect to its face, air, and soil, it is said to be an epitome of all Switzerland, as containing in it hills, valleys,\nvalleys, plains, corn-lands, vineyards, lakes, and rivers. Their wines have a tartness at first, but the longer they are kept the more agreeable they are. The other products are excellent fruits, corn, pasture, fine clay, chalk, several coloured earths, pit-coal, turf, and sulphur. There are also some mineral springs in the canton, and some lakes; Zurich is the most considerable, it is 24 miles long, and two broad. The reformation was introduced here by Zwinglius in the year 1517. This canton is the first in rank, and inferior only to that of Bern in extent, power, and wealth; in consequence of which, its representatives preside in the general diets, when held in any place belonging in common to the cantons; and the affairs relating to the whole confederacy are transacted in its offices. Its quota, for the defence of the several members of the confederacy, is 1400 men. Of one of the two armies raised on these occasions, it nominates one of the commanders in chief, as Lucerne does the other. Its revenue is said to be about 150,000 crowns a-year; of which, one year with another, two thirds are expended in the charges of government, and the rest laid up in the treasury. It can bring 50,000 fighting men into the field at a very short warning.","sp":507,"ep":508},{"h":"ZURICH","t":"the capital of a canton of the same name in Switzerland, stands in a pleasant country, near where the river Aa flows from the lake that takes its name from the town, 23 miles from Schaffhausen, and 114 from Geneva. After having been ruined by Attila the Hun, it is said to have been restored by Thurius, son of Theodoric king of the Goths, from whom it took the name of Thuricum, corrupted afterwards into that of Zurich. It is fortified in the modern way, and has wide ditches, faced with free-stone. There are five arsenals in it, well stored with arms and artillery; an academy or college, having 15 professors; a museum, or chamber of rarities; a stately town-house, the pillars in the front of which are of black marble, streaked with white; and a town library. The sovereignty and administration of all affairs are lodged in the greater and lesser council, out of which are chosen the city-officers, as the councils are out of the 13 companies of burgheers. There are several other councils or colleges, each of which has its particular department. Here are a great variety of silk, woollen, linen, cotton, and other manufactures; this being the place of the greatest trade in all Switzerland. The town is well supplied with provisions by and from its lake. The streets are neat, and houses well built, but not magnificent. In the town-library are several letters to Bullinger from Lady Jane Gray, daughter to the duke of Suffolk. In one of the arsenals is the figure of William Tell, dressed and armed in the ancient Swiss manner, with the cross-bow whence he shot the arrow that struck the apple off his child's head.\n\nBoth men and women are so fond of music, that there are few of them that cannot play on some instrument. If a burgher goes out of town, or a peasant enters it, without a sword, they are liable to be fined. No persons, whatever their rank or office may be, are exempted from the fumitory laws. The burgomasters, who are the same as the advoyers at Bern, have the title of excellence. The hospitals here are neat and well endowed. The environs are pleasant and fruitful; for which it is not a little indebted to the lake. That part of it which is next Zurich is called the Lower Lake, and the other end the Upper. The cathedral, or great church here, is collegiate. The present city is said to owe its origin to a nunnery, founded by the emperor Lewis I., near where the ancient Tigurum stood. E. Long. 8. 30. N.
