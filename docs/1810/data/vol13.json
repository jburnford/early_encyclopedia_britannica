But we may safely venture to assert, that even from many enlightened governments it has hitherto claimed much less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> than its importance merits. At the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a> this has been too much the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>. It is indeed true, that for near 20 years a few lectures on this subject have been delivered at the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, by the professor of the institutions of medicine. But he could by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> means consider the subject on that extensive scale which its importance merited. And he had often expressed his regret, that, as in several of the foreign universities, a professorship had not been instituted for the express purpose of giving a course of lectures on medical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JURISPRUDENCE\">jurisprudence</a>. That defect, however, in medical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> at Edinburgh is now supplied. When that able and upright statesman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Grenville, to whom every thing that regarded the laws of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> was an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of peculiar attention, was at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of his majesty's councils, a regius professorship of juridical and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> medicine was established in the university of Edinburgh by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> warrant.\nAppendix.","sp":82,"ep":83},{"h":"MEDICAL POLICE","t":"Of incomparably greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, and more widely extended influence, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of this subject. It regards not merely the welfare of individuals, but the prosperity and security of nations. It is perhaps the most important branch of general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">police</a>; for its influence is not confined to those whom accidental circumstances bring within its sphere, but extends over the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of the state.\nMany of its principles have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> acknowledged, and considered as necessary consequences of medical and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> truths; and some few of them have acquired the authority of laws. But it was reserved for the philanthropic Frank, to collect the whole into one vast and beneficent system, and to separate it from juridical medicine; in the old systems of which, it was neglected, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> mentioned only in a few short paragraphs. His enlarged mind perceived at once, and fully vindicated its importance. The very name of Medical Police, is now sufficient to attract the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of legislators and of magistrates, and to make them desirous of becoming acquainted with its principles, and anxious to see them carried into execution. In fact, its influence is already visible in the countries where it is cultivated. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the principles of medical police were separated from the professional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of medicine, and communicated in a form generally intelligible, in what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> have we reason to expect more beneficial effects from its influence than this? Where is the spirit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIOTISM\">patriotism</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a> so prevalent? What <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> is more generous in its public institutions? Where does the individual sacrifice a part of his wealth so willingly for the benefit of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>? It seems only necessary to prove that an undertaking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be of advantage to the state, to have it carried into instant execution. But, can medical knowledge be more usefully employed than in pointing out the means of preserving or improving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>; of supplying healthy nourishment to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>, especially in times of scarcity; of opposing the introduction of contagious diseases, and of checking their progress; of securing to the indigent the advantages intended by their benefactors; of rearing the orphan to be the support of the nation which has adopted him; and of diminishing the horrors of confinement to the poor maniac and the criminal? These good effects are not to be promoted so much by rigid laws, as by recommendation and example. Nor can it be reasonably objected to a system of medical police, that it is a pleasing dream, which flatters the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, but the execution of which is in reality impracticable. As well might we entirely throw aside the rules of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>, because <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> one is able to observe them all; or live without laws, because no existing code is unexceptionable.\n\nMedical police may be defined,\u2014The application of the principles deduced from the different branches of medical knowledge, for the promotion, preservation and restoration of general health.\n\nThe effects to be expected from it are the general welfare of the state, and increase of healthy population; and are to be attained by means of public institutions, express laws, and popular instruction. Instructing the people, and convincing them of the propriety of certain precautions and attentions, in regard to their own and the general state of health, are necessary to secure the good effects of our public institutions and regulations; to obtain respect and obedience in many things, to which no express <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> can be adapted; and, to induce them to forego what may be prejudicial to the safety of the community, and of themselves.\n\nPublic medical institutions and laws, must be adapted to the country for which they are intended. Many local circumstances, national character, habits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, prevalent customs and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFESSIONS\">professions</a>, situation, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, &c, make considerable varieties necessary. And many institutions, many a law which would be highly beneficial to the public health, in some circumstances, would be useless, impracticable, and even hurtful, in others. These causes and their effects, must, therefore, be particularly attended to.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> authors who have written on this subject, are Alberti, Heister, Plaz, Frank, Huffly, Metzger, and Hebenstreit; to whom we may add Howard and Rumford.\n\nThe subjects which it comprehends, cannot be classified very regularly or systematically.

Aged.\nObservations on the Means of preserving Health.\n\nHaving now treated of all the most important diseases to which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> body is subjected, we shall conclude the article MEDICINE, with a few observations on the means of preserving health, both for the general management of valetudinarians, and of those also who wish to obtain long life and good health by avoiding the causes of those diseases which the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> often bring upon themselves. On this subject much has been written at almost every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of medicine. And we may refer those readers who wish for a full and extensive view of this interesting subject to a very elaborate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> lately published by Sir John Sinclair Bart., entitled the Code of Health and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONGEVITY\">Longevity</a>. Here we cannot propose to give even an abridged view of this extensive inquiry; but must content ourselves with offering only a very few general observations.\n\nI. Rules for the Management of Valetudinarians.\n\nThat part of the medical system which lays <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> rules for the preservation of health, and prevention of diseases, termed Hygiene, is not to be strictly understood as if it respected only those people who enjoy perfect health, and who are under no apprehensions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, for such seldom either desire or attend to medical advice; but is rather considered as relating to valetudinarians, or such as, though not actually sick, may yet have sufficient reason to fear that they will soon become so; hence it is that the rules must be applied to correct morbid dispositions, and to obviate various particulars which were shown to be the remote or possible causes of diseases.\n\nFrom the way in which the several temperaments are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> mentioned by systematic writers, it should seem as if they meant that every particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> might be referred to one or other of the four; but this is far from being the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, since by much the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of people have temperaments so indifferently marked, that it is hard to say to which of the temperaments they belong.\n\nWhen we actually meet with particular persons who have evidently either,\n\n1. Too much strength and rigidity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIBRE\">fibre</a>, and too much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a>;\n2. Too little strength, and yet too much sensibility;\n3. Too much strength, and but little sensibility; or,\n4. But little sensibility joined to weakness;\n\nwe should look on such persons as more or less in the valetudinary state, who require that these morbid dispositions be particularly watched, lest they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into those diseases which are connected with the different temperaments.\n\nPeople of the first mentioned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPERAMENT\">temperament</a> being liable to suffer from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> fevers, especially of the inflammatory species, their scheme of preserving health should consist in temperate living, with respect both to diet and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>; they should studiously avoid immoderate drinking, and be remarkably cautious lest any of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> discharges be checked. People of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> bear evacuations well, especially bleeding; they ought not, however, to lose blood but when they really require to have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> lessened; because too much of this evacuation would be apt to reduce the constitution to the second-mentioned temperament, in which strength is deficient, but sensibility redundant.\n\nPersons of the second temperament are remarkably prone to suffer from painful and spasmodic diseases, and are easily ruffled; and those of the softer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEX\">sex</a> who have this delicacy of habit, are very much disposed to hysterical complaints. The scheme here should be, to strengthen the solids by moderate exercise, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATHING\">bathing</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CINCHONA\">cinchona</a>, and chalybeate waters; particular attention should constantly be had to the state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGESTIVE\">digestive</a> organs, to prevent them from being overloaded with any species of food which might engender flatus, or irritate the sensitive membranes of the stomach and intestines, from whence the disorder would soon be communicated to the whole nervous system. Persons of this constitution should never take any of the drastic purges, or strong emetics; neither should they lose blood but in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of urgent necessity. But a principal share of management, in these extremely irritable constitutions, consists in avoiding all sudden changes of every sort, especially those with respect to diet and clothing, and in keeping the mind as much as possible in a state of tranquillity; hence the great advantages which people of this frame derive from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of medicinal waters drunk on the spot, on account of that freedom from care and serious business of every kind, which generally obtains in all the places planned for the reception of valetudinarians.\n\nThe third-mentioned temperament, where there is an excess of strength and but little sensibility, does not seem remarkably prone to any distressing or dangerous species of disease; and therefore it can hardly be supposed that persons so circumstanced will either of themselves think of any particular scheme of management, or have recourse to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> for their infirmities; such constitutions, however, we may observe, bear all kinds of evacuations well, and sometimes require them to prevent an over-fullness, which might end in an oppression of the brain or some other organ of importance.\n\nBut the fourth temperament, where we have weakness joined to want of sensibility, is exceedingly apt to fall into tedious and dangerous diseases, arising from a defect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSORBENT\">absorbent</a> power in the proper sets of vessels, and from languor of the circulation in general; whence corpulency, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DROPSY\">dropsy</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JAUNDICE\">jaundice</a>, and different degrees of scrofulous affection. In order to prevent these, or any other species of accumulation and deprivation of the animal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>, the people of this constitution should use a generous course of diet, with brisk exercise,\nMeans of exercise, and be careful that none of the secretions be\npreventing interrupted, nor any of the natural discharges sup-\npressed. These constitutions bear purging well, and often require it; as also the use of emetics, which are frequently found necessary to supply the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of exercise, by agitating the abdominal viscera, and are of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> to prevent the stagnation of bile, or the accumulation of mucous humours, which hinder digestion, and clog the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>. The free use of mustard, horseradish, and the like sort of stimulating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIETETICS\">dietetics</a>, is serviceable in these torpid habits.\n\nWhen the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of fluids is increased beyond what is conducive to the perfection of health, there arises what the writers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> a plethora, which may prove the source of different diseases; and therefore, when this overfulness begins to produce languor and oppression, care should be taken in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to reduce the body to a proper standard, by abridging the food and increasing the natural discharges, using more exercise, and indulging less in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>.\n\nBut in opposite circumstances, where the fluids have been exhausted, we are to attempt the prevention of further waste by the use of strengthening stomachics, nourishing diet, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> from fatigue of body or mind.\n\nVitiated fluids are to be considered as tainted either with the different kinds of general acrimony, or as betraying signs of some of the species of morbid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> which give rise to particular diseases, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALCULUS\">calculus</a>, scurvy, &c.\n\nDuring the state of infancy, we may sometimes observe a remarkable acidity, which not only shows itself in the first passages, but also seems to contaminate the general mass of fluids. As it takes its rise, however, from weak bowels, our views, when we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> to prevent the ill consequences, must be chiefly directed to strengthen the digestive organs, as on their soundness the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> of good chyle depends; and hence small doses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-RHUBARB\">rhubarb</a> and chalybeates (either the natural chalybeate waters mixed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>, or the murias <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMMONIA\">ammonia</a> et ferrri in doses of a few grains, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of the child), are to be administered; and the diet is to be so regulated as not to add to this acid tendency: brisk exercise is likewise to be enjoined, with frictions on the stomach, belly, and lower extremities.\n\nWhere the fluids tend to the putrefactive state, which shows itself by fetid breath, sponginess and bleeding of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUMS\">gums</a>, a bloated look and livid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>, the diet then should be chiefly of fresh vegetables and ripe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, with wine in moderation, due exercise, and strengthening bitters.\n\nWhere acrimony shows itself by itching eruptions, uncommon thirst, and flushing heats, nothing will answer better than such sulphureous waters as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARROWGATE\">Harrowgate</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOFFAT\">Moffat</a>, at the same time using a course of diet that shall be neither acrid nor heating.\n\nSo far with respect to those kinds of morbid matter which do not invariably produce a particular species of disease: but there are others of a specific <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, some of which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> in the body spontaneously, and seem to arise from errors in diet, or other circumstances of ill management with respect to the animal economy; and hence it is sometimes possible, to a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> if not altogether, to prevent the ill con-\n\nsequences. Thus, there are instances where returns of the gout have been prevented by adhering strictly to a milk diet.\n\nThe rheumatism has also been sometimes warded off by wearing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLANNEL\">flannel</a> shirt, or by using the cold bath without interruption.\n\nCalculus may be retarded in its progress, and prevented from creating much distress, by the internal use of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a> and lime-water, by soap less taken in milk or in veal-broth, or by the use of aerated alkaline water, which may perhaps be considered as being both more safe and more efficacious, and at the same time more pleasant, than any of the other practices.\n\nThe scurvy may be prevented by warm clothing and perseverance in brisk exercise, by drinking wine or cider, and eating freely of such vegetable substances as can be had in these situations where this disease is most apt to show itself.\n\nIn constitutions where there is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> disposition to the scrophula, if early precautions be taken to strengthen the solids by cold bathing, a nourishing course of diet, and moderate use of wine, the constitution which gives rise to the disease will probably be prevented from producing any very bad effects.\n\nThe other kinds of morbid matter, which are of the specific nature, are received into the body by infection or contagion.\n\nThe infection of a putrid fever or dysentery is best prevented by immediately taking an emetic on the first attack of the sickness or shivering; and if that do not completely answer, let a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> blister be applied between the shoulders: by this method the nurses and other attendants on the sick in the naval hospitals have often been preserved. As to other infectious morbid matter, we must refer to what has already been said when treating of hydrophobia, poisons, gonorrhoea, &c.\n\nThe ill effects which may arise from the different species of salivary, are to be obviated, in general, by the prudent administration of emetics, and carefully abstaining from such kinds of food as are known to cause the accumulation of noxious matters in the first passages.\n\nCrude vegetables, milk, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a>, and other oily substances, are to be avoided by persons troubled with a fowling in the stomach; brisk exercise, especially riding, is to be used, and they are to refrain from fermented liquors: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> drink should be pure water; or water with a very little of some ardent spirit, such as rum or brandy. Seltzer and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRMONT\">Pyrmont</a> waters are to be drunk medicinally; and aromatic bitters, infusions, or tinctures, acidulated with sulphuric acid, will be found serviceable, in order to strengthen the fibres of the stomach, and promote the expulsion of its contents, thereby preventing the too hasty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENTATION\">fermentation</a> of the alimentary mixture. In order to procure immediate relief, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNESIA\">magnesia</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBA\">alba</a>, or creta preparata, will seldom fail; the magnesia, as well as the chalk, may be made into lozenges, with a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a> and mucilage; and in that form may be carried about and taken occasionally by people afflicted with the acid salivary.\n\nIn constitutions where there is an exuberance or stagnation of bile, and a troublesome bitterness in the mouth, it is necessary to keep the bowels always free, by taking occasionally small doses of pure aloes, olym ricini.\nAppendix.\n\nM E D I C I N E.\n\nMeans of preserving Health.\n\nWhen there is a tendency to the empyreumatic and rancid fuburra, people should carefully avoid all the various kinds of those oily and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>-seasoned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of diet generally termed made-dishes, and eat sparingly of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> meat, without rich sauces or much gravy; and in these cases the most proper drink is pure water.\n\nII. Rules for those who enjoy perfect Health.\n\nThere can be no doubt, that, in general, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">temperance</a> is the true foundation of health; and yet the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> physicians, as we may see in the rules laid down by Celsus, did not scruple to recommend indulgence now and then, and allowed people to exceed both in eating and drinking: but it is safer to proceed to excess in drink than in meat; and if the debauch should create any extraordinary or distressing degree of pain or sickness, and a temporary fever should ensue, there are two ways of shaking it off, either to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> and encourage perspiration, or to get on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>-back and by brisk exercise restore the body to its natural state. The choice of these two methods must always be determined by the peculiar circumstances of the parties concerned, and from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> which they may before have had which agrees best with them.\n\nIf a person should commit excess in eating, especially of high-seasoned things, with rich sauces, a draught of cold water, acidulated with sulphuric acid, will take off the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> at the stomach, and assist digestion by moderating and keeping within bounds the alimentary fermentation, and thus preventing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> of too much flatus. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> of ices may be here of real service at the tables of the great, as producing similar effects with the cold water acidulated. Persons in these circumstances ought not to lay themselves down to sleep, but should keep up and use gentle exercise until they are sensible that the stomach is unloaded, and that they no longer feel any oppressive weight about the praecordia.\n\nIf a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> be obliged to fast, he ought, if possible, during that time, to avoid laborious work: after suffering severe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a>, people ought not at once to gorge and fill themselves; nor is it proper, after being overfilled, to enjoy an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> fast: neither is it safe to indulge in a state of total rest immediately after excessive labour, nor suddenly fall hard to work after having been long without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>: in a word, all changes should be made by gentle degrees; for though the constitution of the human body be such that it can bear many alterations and irregularities without much danger, yet, when the transitions are extremely sudden, there is a great risk of producing some degree of disorder.\n\nIt is also the advice of Celsus to vary the scenes of life, and not confine ourselves to any settled rules: but as inaction renders the body weak and listless, and exercise gives vigour and strength, people should never long omit riding, walking, or going abroad in a carriage. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FENCING\">Fencing</a>, playing at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TENNIS\">tennis</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DANCING\">dancing</a>, or other similar engagements, which afford both exercise and amusement, as each shall be found most agreeable or convenient, are to be used in turn, according to the circumstances and tendency to any particular species of disease. But when the weaknesses of old age shall have rendered the body incapable of all these, then dry frictions with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a> will be very requisite to preserve health, by accelerating the flow of humours through the smallest orders of vessels, and preventing the fluids from stagnating too long in the cellular interstices of the fleshy parts.\n\nSleep is the great restorer of strength; for, during this time, the nutritious particles appear to be chiefly applied to repair the waste, and replace those that have been abraded and washed off by the labour and exercise of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>; but too much indulgence in sleep has many inconveniences, both with respect to body and mind, as it blunts the senses, and encourages the fluids to stagnate in the cellular membrane; whence corpulency, and its necessary consequences languor and weakness.\n\nThe proper time for sleep is the night, when darkness and silence naturally bring it on: sleep in the daytime, from noise and other circumstances, is in general not so found or refreshing; and to some people is really distasteful, as creating an unusual giddiness and languor, especially in persons addicted to literary pursuits. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">Custom</a>, however, frequently renders sleep in the day necessary; and in those constitutions where it is found to give real refreshment, the propensity to it ought to be indulged, particularly in very advanced age.\n\nWith regard to the general regimen of diet, it has always been held as a rule, that the softer and milder kinds of aliment are most proper for children and younger subjects: that grown persons should eat what is more substantial; and old people lessen their quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> food, and increase that of their drink both of the diluent and cordial kind.","sp":83,"ep":87},{"h":"MEDICI","t":"LORENZO DE, filled, with great propriety, the Magnificent, was the grandson of Cosmo, and about 16 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> at his decease.

In the year 1474, Lorenzo incurred the displeasure of the pope for the opposition he\nhe made to some of his encroachments on the petty princes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, and for this reason he deprived him of the office of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURER\">treasurer</a> of the Roman see, which he conferred on one Pazzi, connected with a Florentine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of which he thus secured, and intended to sacrifice Lorenzo and Giuliano to his private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a>. Their assassination was fixed for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUNDAY\">Sunday</a>, April 26, 1478, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a> was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in which a monitor of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> had resolved to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> them by the instigation of the pope. When the people <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> one of their favourites (Giuliano) expiring, and the other (Lorenzo) covered with blood, their rage was not to be expressed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>. The interference of the magistrates was finally victorious, who had the courage and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> to hang the archbishop from one of the windows, arrayed in his pontifical robes, which made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORENCE\">Florence</a> resound with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCLAMATION\">acclamation</a>\u2014Medici! Medic! <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> with their enemies!\n\nLorenzo was delivered from that part of the cathedral to which he had fled for refuge, and was triumphantly carried home, where his wounds were attended to by men of ability. His friends in the meantime pursued the conspirators, and spared none who happened to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> in their way. In a word, the generality of them were either hanged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> decapitated, and very few had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a> to escape their uncommon vigilance. Much to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of Lorenzo, he exerted all his influence to prevent the indiscriminate massacre of his cruel enemies, and restrain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> indignation of the people, begging that they would trust the magistrates with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> of the guilty; and the respect in which he was held had the most astonishing effect in restraining the vengeance of popular indignation.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> sooner had hostilities ceased between Pope Sixtus and the Florentine republic, then Lorenzo began to develop plans for securing the internal peace and tranquillity of Italy, by which the highest honour has been conferred on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. But the life of this great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> was again brought into imminent danger by the intrigues of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a> Riaro, and some Florentine exiles, who determined to assassinate him in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARMELITES\">Carmelites</a>, on the festival of the Ascension 1481; but the plot was happily discovered, the conspirators were executed, and after this Lorenzo very seldom went abroad without being surrounded by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of friends in whom he could securely confide.\n\nWhen we attentively examine the character of Lorenzo, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not perhaps appear astonishing, that Italy, Christendom, and even the Mahometans themselves, conferred upon him the most flattering approbation. Even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRANDOLA\">Mirandola</a> chose Florence as the place of his residence entirely upon his account, and there ended his mortal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a>. To a most engaging person Lorenzo added almost every other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMPLISHMENT\">accomplishment</a>. He was the favourite of the ladies, the envy of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>, and the admiration of all. He was declared to be unrivalled in chivalry, and one of the most eminent orators that the world in any age has produced. According to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of his contemporaries, he was even superior to Julius Caesar himself, except as a general, yet he would also have proved a most consummate commander had not peace been always the darling of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>. We recollect a memorable passage in the Rambler, which may here be appropriately introduced. A great man condescending to do little things, is like the Medicis. Fun in his western declination; he remits his splendor, but retains his magnitude, and pleases more though he dazzles less. To such little things did Lorenzo frequently submit, often seeking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> in his nursery, and spending hours there in all the frivolous pranks of childish diversion. The gravity of his life, if contrasted with its levity, must make him appear as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of two different persons, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a>, and, as it were, impossible to be joined the one with the other.\n\nSuch were the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> and veneration of the citizens for Lorenzo, that the physician who attended him on his deathbed, terrified to return to Florence, left the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> in a state of distraction, and plunged himself into a well. When Ferdinand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a> was informed of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, he cried out, \"This man has lived <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> enough for his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, but too short a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> for Italy.\" He died on the 8th of April 1492, amidst a number of his weeping friends, who appeared deeply conscious of such an irreparable loss.\n\nMedicis, John de, on account of his bravery and knowledge in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> affairs, was surnamed the Invincible. He was the son of John, otherwise called Fourdun, de Medicis. His only son Cosmo I. styled the Great, was chosen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Florence after the murder of Alexander de Medicis, A.D. 1537. He first carried arms under Laurence de Medicis against the duke of Urbino, afterwards under Pope Leo X. Upon the death of Leo, he entered into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of Francis I., which he quitted to follow the fortune of Francis Sforza duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILAN\">Milan</a>. When Francis I. formed an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> with the pope and the Venetians against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a>, he returned to his service. He was wounded in the knee at Governola, a small town in the Mantuan territory, by a musket <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a>; and being carried to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANTUA\">Mantua</a>, he died the 29th of November 1526, aged 28. Brantome relates, that when his leg was to be cut off, and when he was informed that he needed some person to support him, \"Proceed without fear (said he), I need nobody!\" and he held the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> himself during the operation. This anecdote is also mentioned by Varchi. John de Medicis was above the middle stature, strong, and nervous. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>, to express their affection for him and their concern for his loss, assumed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOURNING\">mourning</a> dress and standards, which gave the name of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> band to the Tuscan troops whom he commanded.\n\nMedicis, Laurence, or Laurencius de, was descended from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> of Cosmo the Great, and affected the name of popular. In 1537, he killed Alexander de Medicis, whom <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> V. had made duke of Florence, and who was believed to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> son of Laurence de Medicis duke of Urbino. He was jealous of Alexander's power, and disguised this jealousy under the specious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRETEXT\">pretext</a> of love to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. He loved men of learning, and cultivated literature. His works are, 1. Lamenti, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODENA\">Modena</a>, 12mo. 2. Acidoso Commedia, Florence 1595, 12mo. He died without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>.\n\nMedicis, Hypolitus de, natural son of Julian de Medicis and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> of Urbino, was early remarkable for the brilliancy of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> and the graces of his person. Pope Clement VII. his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUSIN\">cousin</a>, made him cardinal in 1529, and sent him as legate into Germany to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of Charles V. When that prince went into Italy, Medicis, yielding to his warlike disposition, appeared.\nMedici appeared in the dress of an officer, and advanced before the emperor, followed by several respectable gentlemen of the court. Charles, naturally suspicious, and afraid that the legate intended to do him some ill offices with the pope, sent after him and caused him to be apprehended. But when he understood that it was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> fallacy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a> in the young cardinal, he set him at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> in a few days. The character which Medici obtained by the happy success of this appointment was of essential service to him. He was considered as one of the supports of the Holy See; and a little before Clement's death, when the corsair Barbarossa made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> into Italy to the great terror of Rome, which was only defended by 200 of the pope's guards, Medici was despatched to protect the coasts from the fury of the barbarians. On his arrival at the place of destination, he was fortunate enough to find that Barbarossa had withdrawn himself at that critical moment; which allowed him to claim the honour of the retreat without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> his person or his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>. When he returned to Rome, he was of great service in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> of Paul III., who nevertheless refused to make him legate to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCONA\">Ancona</a>, though that office had been promised to him in the conclave. Enraged also that the pope had bestowed the principality of Florence on Alexander de Medici, supposed to be the natural son of Laurence duke of Urbino, he was prompted by his ambition to believe that he might succeed to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> by the destruction of Alexander. He entered into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a> against him, and determined to carry him off by a mine; but the plot was discovered before he had accomplished his purpose. Octavian Zanga, one of his guards, was arrested as his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMPLICE\">accomplice</a>. Hyppolitus de Medici, apprehensive for his own safety, retired to a castle near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIVOLI\">Tivoli</a>. On his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> to Naples, he fell sick at Itri in the territory of Fondi, and died August 13, 1535, in his 24th year, not without suspicion of being poisoned. His house was an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASYLUM\">asylum</a> for the unfortunate, and frequently for those who were guilty of the blackest crimes. It was open to men of all nations; and he was frequently addressed in twenty different languages. He had a natural son named Andrea de Medici, who was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">knight</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MALTA\">Malta</a>. This anecdote proves that his manners were more military than ecclesiastic. He wore a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>, and never put on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of cardinal except on occasions of public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a>. He was wholly devoted to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a>, hunting, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>.\n\nMedici, Alexander de, first duke of Florence in 1539, was natural son of Laurence de Medici, further named the Younger, and nephew of Pope Clement VII. He owed his elevation to the intrigues of his uncle and to the arms of Charles V. This prince having made himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of Florence after an obstinate siege, conferred the sovereignty of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> on Alexander, and afterwards gave him in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> Margaret of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-AUSTRIA\">Austria</a> his natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a>. According to the terms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITULATION\">capitulation</a> granted to the Florentines, the new duke was to be only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> doge, and his authority was tempered by councils, which left them at least a shadow of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> liberty. But Alexander, who felt himself supported by the emperor and the pope, was no sooner in possession of his new dignity, than he began to govern like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a>; being guided by no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> but his own caprice, indulging the most brutal passions, and making <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> of discouraging families, and of violating even the asylum of the cloisters to gratify his lust. Among the confidants of his debauchery was a relation of his own, Laurence de Medici. This young man, who was only 22 years of age, at the instigation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> Strozzi, a zealous republican, conceived the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of assassinating Alexander, and thereby of delivering his country from oppression. From the moment when he first became attached to him, he tried to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> his confidence, for no other reason but that he might the better have it in his power to take away his life. A considerable time elapsed before he found such an opportunity as he desired. At length, under pretence of procuring the duke a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with a lady of whom he was deeply enamoured, he brought him alone and unattended into his chamber, and put him under his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a>. He went out, under pretence of introducing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>; and returned along with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSASSIN\">assassin</a> by profession, to whom alone he had entrusted his design, only to stab him. This cruel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> happened on the night betwixt the 5th and 6th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1537. Alexander was only 26 years of age. The Florentines derived no advantage from this crime of Laurence, for they failed in their attempt to recover their liberty. The party of the Medici prevailed, and Alexander was succeeded by Cosmo; whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, it must be confessed, was as just and moderate, as that of his predecessor had been violent and tyrannical. Laurence de Medici fled to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a>, to some of the leaders of the malecontents at Florence, who had taken refuge there; but not thinking himself in sufficient security, he went to Constantinople, whence he returned sometime after to Venice. He was there assassinated in 1547, ten years after the duke's murder, by two soldiers, one of whom had formerly been in Alexander's guards: And these soldiers were generous enough to refuse a considerable sum of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, which was the price put upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>.\n\nMedici, Cosmo de, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUSCANY\">Tuscany</a>, joined Charles V. against the French, after trying in vain to continue neutral. As a reward for his services, the emperor added to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUCHY\">duchy</a> of Tuscany <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PIOMBINO\">Piombino</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">isle</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELBA\">Elba</a>, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>. Cosmo soon after received from Pope Pius IV. the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of grand duke; and had it not been opposed by all the princes of Italy, this pontiff, who was entirely devoted to Cosmo, because he had thought proper to acknowledge him to be of his house, would have conferred on him the title of king. There never was a more zealous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> of learning. Ambitious of imitating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> C\u00e6sar, he like him, was fond of learned men, kept them near his person, and founded for them the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PISA\">Pisa</a>. He died in 1574, at the age of 55, after governing with equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> and glory. In 1562 he instituted the military order of St. Stephen.

The former consists of the medical precepts which may be of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> to the legislature <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> to the magistracy. The latter is the aggregate of all the information, afforded by the different branches of medicine, which is necessary for elucidating doubtful questions in courts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>.\n\nAlthough there are some traces of juridical medicine in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTINIAN\">Justinian</a> code; such as determining the real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of birth, with a view to prevent the imposition of spurious children: it properly originated with the code of laws enacted by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> V. under the name of Constitutione criminalis Carolina; in which it is ordained, that the opinions of physicians should be taken, with regard to the danger of wounds, child <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a>, murder, poisoning, procured <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABORTION\">abortion</a>, concealed pregnancy, &c. These directions, and the impossibility which was found of determining many questions by simply legal means, induced some legislators to enjoin, that all tribunals and judges should procure from sworn physicians, appointed to this office, their opinions concerning all the subjects to be mentioned hereafter.\n\nSince that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, it has been treated systematically by many learned men; such as Fortunatus Fidelis, Zacchias, Alberti, Hebenstreit, Haller, Ludwig, Plenck; and lastly, in the most masterly manner, by Metzger. Numberless dissertations have been written on all its parts; and among those who contributed to its advancement, we may reckon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBROSE\">Ambrose</a> Parry, Bolin, Butener, Morgagni, Camper, and Gruner. Collections of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, illustrating its principles, have been made by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMMAN\">Amman</a>, Daniel, Bucholz, Pyl, Scheff and Metzger. These are only a few of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> writers, who have attended to this science: to enumerate more would be unnecessary.\n\nFrom its very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, it is evident how necessary a knowledge of this science must be to every medical practitioner, who is liable to be called upon to illustrate any question comprehended under it before a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>. On his answers, the fate of the accused person must often depend; both judge and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JURY\">jury</a> regulating their decision by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, while he is delivering his sentiments, his own reputation is before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> of the public. The acuteness of the gentlemen of the law is universally acknowledged; the versatility of their genius, and the quickness of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a>, are rendered almost inconceivable, by constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>. It is their duty to make every possible exertion for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of their client, and they seldom leave unnoticed any inaccurate or contradictory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>. How cautious must, then, a medical practitioner be, when examined before such men, when it is their duty to expose his errors, and magnify his uncertainties, till his evil influence seem contradictory and absurd? How often must he expose himself to such severe criticism, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he be not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the subject on which he is giving evidence, and have not arranged his thoughts on it according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> principles? On the other hand, he may deserve and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>, by so public a display of judgement and professional knowledge.\n\nSome acquaintance with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of medical science must be useful at least, and sometimes necessary, to judges and lawyers. They will thus be enabled to estimate how much they may depend on the opinion of any physician, and will know how to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> their questions, so as to arrive at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, and avoid being misled by his partiality or favourite opinions. To the lawyer who conducts the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of an accused person, in a criminal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, it is almost indispensible; without it, he cannot do justice to the cause of his client.\n\nBefore criminal courts, the questions which occur most generally are, respecting\n\n1.

His conduct was distinguished for urbanity and kindness to the superior ranks of his fellow citizens, and by a constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the wants of the lower classes, whom his munificence abundantly relieved. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> and moderation, however, could not repel the ambitious designs of the rival families, the Florentines and Medici; for in 1433, Rinaldo de Albizzi, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of a formidable party, carried the appointment of the magistracy.

In this dismal situation he remained four days, shut up from all his kindred and friends, where he soon expected to be numbered with the dead. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> employed to take him off, unexpectedly proved his friend. Malavolta, the keeper of the prison, relented, and declared that he had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> reason to be alarmed, as he hesitated not to eat of every thing that was brought him.\n\nHis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> Lorenzo, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUSIN\">cousin</a> Averardo, raised a considerable body of men in Romagna and other districts; and being joined by the commander of the republican forces, they marched to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORENCE\">Florence</a> to relieve him. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> was obtained from the magistracy, by which he was banished to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PADUA\">Padua</a> for ten years, his brother to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a> for five, and several of their relations shared a similar fate.

He rather experienced the treatment of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> than of an exile, as they entertained the highest expectations from his great commercial knowledge.

In his public and private charities he was almost unbounded, and perhaps possessed more wealth than any single individual in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> at that period. In his promotion of science and encouragement of learned men he was truly exemplary, and from this source he acquired the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> and esteem.\n\nHis fostering <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> protected the arts as well as the sciences; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SCULPTURE\">sculpture</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a>, all flourished under his powerful protection.

The tyranny of his uncle Neleus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Pylos, obliged him to leave his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>; and Proetus, to show himself more sensible of his services, gave him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>. About this time the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> charms of Pero, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Neleus, had gained many admirers; but the father promised his daughter only to him who brought into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> the oxen of Iphicles. This condition displeased many; but Bias, who was also one of her admirers, engaged his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> Melampus to steal the oxen and deliver them to him. Melampus was caught in the attempt, and imprisoned; and nothing but his services as a footfayrer and physician to Iphicles would have saved him from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. All this pleaded in the favour of Melampus; but when he had taught the children Iphicles how to become a father, he not only obtained his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, but also the oxen; and with them he compelled Neleus to give Pero in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> to Bias.

In his youth he made an admirable progress in learning, and was made Greek professor at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITTENBERG\">Wittenberg</a> in 1509. Here his lectures upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a>, and the Greek text of St Paul's Epistle to Titus, drew to him a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of auditors, and entirely effaced the contempt to which his low stature and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> appearance had exposed him. Melanchthon reduced the sciences to systems; and acquired such reputation, that he had sometimes 2,500 auditors. He soon entered into an intimate friendship with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUTHER\">Luther</a>, who taught <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a> in the same university; and in 1519 they went together to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEIPZIG\">Leipzig</a>, to dispute with Eicus. The following years he was continually engaged in various employments; he composed several books; he taught divinity; took several journeys, in order to found colleges and visit churches; and in 1530 drew up a confession of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, which goes by the name of the Confession of Augsburg, because it was presented to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> at the diet held in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>. All <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> was convinced, that he was not, like Luther, backward to accommodate the differences between the various sects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>. He hated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> disputes, and was drawn into them only through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> he was called to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> in the world; and therefore would have sacrificed many things to have produced an union among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTESTANTS\">Protestants</a>. For this reason, Francis I., the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>, wrote to desire him to come and confer with the doctors of the Sorbonne, in order to agree with them about putting an end to all controversies; but though Luther endeavoured to persuade the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELECTOR\">elector</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAXONY\">Saxony</a> to consent to that journey, and though Melanchthon himself desired it, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, whether he distrusted Melanchthon's moderation, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> was afraid of quarrelling with the emperor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> V., would never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> his permission. The king of England also vainly desired to see him. Melanchthon, in 1529, assisted at the conferences of Spire. In 1541, he was at the famous conferences at Ratibon. In 1543, he went to meet the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOGNE\">Cologne</a> to assist him in introducing the reformation into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIOCESE\">diocese</a>; but that project came to nothing; and in 1548, he assisted at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> conferences on the subject of the interim of Charles V., and wrote a censure on that interim, and all the writings presented at these conferences. He was extremely affected at the divisions raised by Flacius Illyricus. His last conference with those of the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNION\">communion</a> was at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">Worms</a>, in 1557. He died at Wittenberg in 1560, and was interred near Luther. Some days before he died, he wrote upon a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> the reasons which made him look upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of them was, that it \"delivered him from theological persecutions.\" <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">Nature</a> had given Melanchthon a peaceable temper, which was but ill suited to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> he was to live in. His moderation served only to be his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>. He was like a lamb in the midst of wolves. Nobody liked his mildness; it looked as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he was...\nwas lukewarm; and even Luther himself was sometimes angry at it.\n\nMelanchthon was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> in whom many good as well as great qualities were wonderfully united. He had great parts, great learning, great sweetness of temper, moderation, contentedness, and the like, which would have made him very happy in any other times but those in which he lived. He never affected dignities, or honours, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a>, but was rather negligent of all these things; too much so in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of some, considering he had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>; and his son-in-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> Sabinus, who was of a more ambitious temper, was actually at variance with him upon this very account. Learning was infinitely obliged to him on many accounts; on none more than this, that, as already observed, he reduced almost all the sciences which had been taught before in a vague <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> manner, into systems. Considering the distractions of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, and the infinity of disputes and tumults in which he was engaged, it is astonishing how he could find leisure to write so many books. Their number is prodigious, inasmuch that it was thought necessary to publish a chronological catalogue of them in the year 1582. His works indeed are not correct, and he himself owned it: but as he found them useful, he chose rather to print a great number, than to finish only a few: \"which however (as Bayle says), was pollporing his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> to the advantage of others.\" His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> was very weak, and required great tenderness and management; which made Luther, as hot and zealous as he was, blame him for labouring too earnestly in the vineyard.","sp":97,"ep":98},{"h":"MELANIPPIDES","t":"in fabulous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, a Greek poet about 520 years before Christ.

Melchisedec came to meet Abraham as far as the valley of Shaveh, which was afterwards named the King's valley, presented him with the refreshment of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> and wine (or he offered bread and wine in sacrifice to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>, for he was a priest of the most high God), and blessed him.

After this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> mention made of the person of Melchisedec; only the Psalmist (cx. 4.) speaking of the Messiah, says, \"Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.\" St Paul, in his epistle to the Hebrews, unfolds the mystery which is concealed in what is said of Melchisedec in the Old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>. See Heb. v. 6\u201410. An infinite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of difficulties and scruples have been started upon the subject of Melchisedec.\u2014St Jerome thought that Salem, of which Melchisedec was king, was not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Salem near Scythopolis, where they still pretended to show the ruins of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>. The greatness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of these ruins are a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the magnificence of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>. He thinks it was at this city of Salem or Shalem, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JACOB\">Jacob</a> arrived after his passage over Jordan, at his return from Mesopotamia (Gen. xxxiii. 18.). Some believe that Salem, where Melchisedec reigned, is the same as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SALIM\">Salim</a> spoken of in the gospel of St John, chap. iii. 23. From the time of Epiphanes there were names invented for the father and mother of Melchisedec. To his father was given the name of Heraclas or Heracles, and to his mother that of Alhtaroth or Astaria. It is generally agreed on by the learned, that when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOSTLE\">apostle</a> says, he was \"without father and without mother,\" no more is meant, than that he is introduced into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of Abraham without acquainting us who he was, or whence he came, where he lived, or when he died. Nevertheless, some have taken St Paul's words literally, and contended that he was not of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> but divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGEN\">Origen</a> and Didymus took him to be an angel; and the author of the Questions upon the Old and New Testament pretends, that he was the Holy Ghost, who appeared to Abraham in a human form. The Arabic Catena, upon the ninth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENESIS\">Genesis</a>, makes Melchisedec to be descended from Shem by his father, and from Japheth by his mother. Heraclas or Heraclim his father, was, they say, son or grandson of Phaleg, and son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBER\">Heber</a>; and his mother named Salathiel, was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Gomer son of Japheth. Cedrenus and others derive Melchisedec from an Egyptian stock. They say his father was called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIDON\">Sidon</a> or Sida, and was the founder of the city of Sidon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of Phenicia. Suidas says he was of the cursed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANAAN\">Canaan</a>; for which reason the scripture does not mention his genealogy. The Jews and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SAMARITANS\">Samaritans</a> believed Melchisedec to be the same\nMelchisedec was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIARCH\">patriarch</a> Shem; which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> has been followed by a great number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> writers. M. Jurius undertook to prove that he is the same as Cham or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAM\">Ham</a>. It would be endless to set <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> all the opinions upon this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>; therefore we shall only add, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> Cuneus and Peter du Moulin have affirmed, that Melchisedec who appeared to Abraham was the Son of God, and that the patriarch worshipped him and acknowledged him for the Messiah.\n\nAbout the beginning of the third century arose the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERESY\">heresy</a> of the Melchisedecians, who affirmed that Melchisedec was not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, but a heavenly power, superior to Jesus Christ; for Melchisedec, they said, was the intercessor and mediator of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGELS\">angels</a>, but Jesus Christ was so only for men, and his priesthood only a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of that of Melchisedec, who was the Holy Ghost.\n\nWe shall only beg leave to add here one opinion more concerning Melchisedec, which is that of the learned Heidegger, who, as the author of the *Hihi Patriar*, thinks, has taken the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> method of explaining the accounts of Moses and the apostle Paul relating to this extraordinary person. He supposes a twofold Melchisedec; the one historical, whereof Moses gives an account in the 14th chapter of Genesis, as that he was king as well as high priest of Jerusalem; the other allegorical, whom St Paul describes, and this allegorical person is Jesus Christ.\n\nAs the history of this prince and priest is so little known, it is no wonder, as Selden observes, that many fabulous accounts have been invented of him; of which the following may suffice as a specimen. Eutychus patriarch of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a> relates, that the body of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a> having been embalmed according to his order, was deposited in a cave under a mountain of the children of Seth; but that Adam before his death had commanded that they should take away his remains from that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, and transport them to the middle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>: that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOAH\">Noah</a>, to follow the orders of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>, had preserved the bodies of Adam and all the patriarchs with him in the ark: that finding himself near his death, he ordered his son Shem to take the body of Adam, to furnish himself with bread and wine for his journey, to take with him Melchisedec the son of Phaleg, and to go to the place in which an angel would show them where to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> the first man: that Noah added this order, \"Command Melchisedec to fix his residence in that place, and to live unmarried all his lifetime, because God has chosen him to do <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> in his presence; command him, that he build no temple, nor shed the blood of birds, nor four-footed beasts, or any other animal; and that he offer no other oblations to God but bread and wine.\" This is the reason, according to this author, why Melchisedec, when he met Abraham, brought forth only bread and wine.\n\nA Greek author, under the name of Athanasius, relates, that Melchisedec was the son of an idolatrous king called Melchi and of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> called Salem.\u2014Melchi, having resolved to offer a sacrifice to the gods, sent his son Melchisedec to fetch him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> calves. In the way the young prince was enlightened by God, and immediately returned to his father, to demonstrate to him the vanity of his idols. Melchi, in wrath, sent him back to fetch the victims. While he was absent, the king sacrificed his eldest son, and a great many Melchisedec's other children, to his gods. Melchisedec returning, and conceiving great horror at this butchery, retired to Mount Tabor, where he lived seven years, without clothes, and fed only on wild <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>. At the end of seven years, God appeared to Abraham, bid him go up to Mount Tabor, where he should find Melchisedec. He ordered him to clothe him, and to ask his blessing; which Abraham having done, Melchisedec anointed him with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, and they came down together from the mountain.","sp":98,"ep":99},{"h":"MELCHITES","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, the name given to the Syrian, Egyptian, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVANT\">Levant</a>.

On account of its quarrels with Weymouth, in the reign of Henry VI. its privileges as a port were removed to Poole; but in that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a> they were restored to it by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of parliament, which was confirmed in the next reign, on condition that Melcomb and Weymouth should make but one corporation, and enjoy their privileges in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>; and to this was owing the flourishing state of both. In the two reigns last mentioned, a wooden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> with seventeen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> was built from hence to Weymouth; to which, as well as its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> contributors were certain citizens of London; and upon its decay it was rebuilt in 1770. Here is a good market-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> and town-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALL\">hall</a>, to which the members of the corporation of Weymouth come to attend public business, as the inhabitants do to its church for public worship. For several years past the sea has retired from it on the east, the priory formerly being bounded by the sea; but there is now a street beyond it, from which it is several paces to the high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> mark. The priory was situated in the east <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the town, in Maiden street, whose site occupied about an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a>, now covered with tenements. On the south side are the remains of the chapel, now converted into a malt-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>. Near it are the remains of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, formerly a nunnery. Here are three meeting houses and a workhouse for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>. The church, which is in the middle of the town, has a wooden turret for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELL\">bell</a>, and had been an old chapel. It was rebuilt in 1605, and made parochial, and is a handsome fabric, with a beautiful altarpiece painted and given by Sir James Thornhill. The port, which generally goes by the name of Weymouth, is said to be the best frequented in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a>, and is defended by Sandford and Portland castles. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a> for both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> are Tuesdays and Fridays, but there are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAIRS\">fairs</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MELCOMB_REGIS\">Melcomb-regis</a> is reckoned bigger, more thriving, and\nand populous than Weymouth.

This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, with those of Carache, Canabac, and La Gallina, are the only ones where the Europeans may trade with some security.

It is a somewhat singular circumstance, that the real author of this most admirable treatise should never before have been publicly known (it having been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> attributed to the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of Melmota Egmont, and particularly by Mr Walpole in his Catalogue); which is the more surprising, as the author is plainly pointed out in the following short character prefixed to the book itself: \"It may add <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, perhaps, to the reflections contained in the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a>, to inform the reader, that the author's life was one uniform exemplar of those precepts which, with so generous a zeal, and such an elegant and affecting simplicity of style, he endeavours to recommend to general practice.

Vocal melody is called singing; and that which is performed upon instruments may be termed symphonic melody.\n\nThe idea of rhythmus necessarily enters into that of melody. An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> is not an air but in proportion as the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> are observed. The same succession of sounds is susceptible of as many different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>, as many different kinds of melody, as the various ways by which its emphatic notes, and the quantities of those which intervene, may be diversified; and the change in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of the notes alone, may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISGUISE\">disguise</a> that very succession in such a manner that it cannot be known. Thus, melody in itself is nothing; it is the rhythmus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> measure which determines it, and there can be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> air without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> then we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> measure...\nmeasure from both, we cannot compare melody with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a>; for to the former it is essential, but not at all to the latter.\n\nMelody, according to the manner in which it is considered, has a relation to two different principles. When regarded only as agreeable to the proportions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> and the rules of modulation, it has its principle in harmony; since it is a harmonical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a>, which exhibits the different gradations of the scale, the chords peculiar to each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a>, and the laws of modulation, which are the sole elements that compose an air. According to this principle, the whole power of melody is limited to that of pleasing the ear by agreeable sounds, as the eye may be pleased with an agreeable assemblage of suitable colours. But when considered as an imitative art, by which we may affect the mind with various images, excite different emotions in the heart, inflame or soothe the passions; by which, in a word, we produce different effects upon our moral faculties, which are not to be effectuated by the influence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> alone, we must explore another principle for melody: for in our whole internal frame there appears to be no power upon which either harmony alone, or its necessary results, can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a>, to affect us in such a manner.\n\nWhat then is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> principle? It is as much founded on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> as the first; but, in order to discover its foundation in nature, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> require a more accurate though simpler observation, and a more exquisite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> in the observer. This principle is the same which varies the tone of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>, when we speak; according as we are interested in what we say, and according to the different emotions which we feel in expressing it. It is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCENT\">accent</a> of languages which determines the melody of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>; it is the accent which determines us to employ the emphasis of speaking while we sing, and to speak with more or less energy according as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> which we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> is more or less accented. That language whose accents are the most sensible, ought to produce a more passionate and more lively melody; that which has little accentuation, or none at all, can only produce a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> and languid melody, without character and without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>. These are the true principles: in proportion as we depart from them, when we speak of the power of music upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> heart, we shall become unintelligible to ourselves and others: our words will be without meaning.\n\nIf music does not impress the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> with images but by melody, if from thence it obtains its whole power, it must follow, that all musical sounds which are not pleasing by themselves alone, however agreeable to harmony they may be, is not an imitative music; and, being incapable, even with its most beautiful chords, either to present the images of things, or to excite the finer feelings, very soon cloy the ear, and leaves always the heart in cold indifference. It follows likewise, that notwithstanding the parts which harmony has introduced, and which the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> of music so wantonly abuses, wherever two different melodies are heard at the same time, they counteract each other, and destroy the effects of both, however beautiful each may be when performed alone: from whence it may be judged with what degree of taste the French composers have introduced in their operas the miserable practice of accompanying one air with another, as well in singing, which is the native expression of pathos and sentiment, as in instrumental performances; which is the same thing as if whimsical orators should take it in their heads to recite two orations at the same time, that the elegance of each might derive more force from the other.\n\nSo much for Rousseau. The translator, however, has reason to fear, that the causes by which national melody is diversified and characterized, are more profound and permanent than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> accentuation of language. This indeed may have great influence in determining the nature of the rhythmus, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of emphatic notes; but very little in regulating the nature of the emphasis and expression themselves. If Rousseau's principle be true in its full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, he must of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> acknowledge, that an air which was never set or intended for words, however melodious, cannot be imitative; he must likewise confess, that what is imitative in one nation cannot be such in another: nor can it be denied, upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, that the recitative, which is formed upon the mode of speaking, is the most forcible of all melodies; which is absurd. His other observations are at once judicious and profound. Though it is impossible to exhibit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and variety of harmony by playing the same melody at the same time upon different keys, admitting those keys to form among themselves a perfect chord, which will of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> preserve all the subsequent notes in the same intervals; yet this perfect harmony would by no means be uniformly pleasing to the ear. We must therefore of necessity introduce less perfect chords to vary and increase the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, and these chords in any complex system of music must of necessity produce dissonances. It then becomes the business of the composer to be careful that these dissonances may arise as naturally from, and return as naturally to perfect harmony as possible. All these causes must inevitably vary the melody of the different parts; but still, amidst all these difficulties, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a> ought to be zealous in preserving the melody of each as homogeneous with the others as possible, that the result of the whole may be in some measure uniform. Otherwise, by counteracting each other, the parts will reciprocally destroy the effects one of another.","sp":102,"ep":103},{"h":"MELOE","t":"a genus of insects of the order of coleoptera.

It was called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>; and there was an entire temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OSIRIS\">Osiris</a>, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APIS\">Apis</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> sacred ox was kept and worshipped.

There was likewise a temple of Venus, and a Serapium in a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> place, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> heaps up hills of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> very dangerous to travellers; together with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of sphinxes, the heads of some of them only being visible, the others covered up to the middle of their body. The same author likewise informs us, that in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of the city there were many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>; and that it contained a number of palaces, at that time in ruins. These buildings, he said, formerly stood upon an eminence; they lay along the side of the hill, stretching down to the lakes and groves, 40 stadia from the city. There was likewise a mountain in the neighbourhood, on which were a great number of pyramids, with the sepulchres of the kings, among which were three remarkable, and two of them accounted wonders of the world. From this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>, Mr Bruce concludes that the celebrated capital of Egypt stood in the place where the villages of Metrahenny are now situated; in opposition to Dr Shaw's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, who thinks it was situated at Geeza or Gifa.\n\nM. Savary has also shown, that Gifa was not the situation of the ancient Memphis.

Large heaps of rubbish are still to be seen there; but the Arabs have transported to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAIRO\">Cairo</a> the columns and remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, which they have disposed, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and without order, in their mosques and public buildings. This city extended as far as Saccara; and was almost wholly encompassed by lakes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of which are still subsiding. It was necessary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> them to convey the dead to the sepulchre of their fathers. The tombs, hewn out of the rock, were closed up with stones of a proportionable size, and covered with sand. These bodies embalmed with so much care, preserved with so much respect, are torn from the monuments they repose in, and sold without decency to strangers by the inhabitants of Saccara. This place is called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> of mummies. There too we find the well of the birds, into which one descends by means of a rope. It leads to subterranean galleries, filled with earthen vases containing the sacred birds. They are rarely met with entire, because the Arabs <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> them in hopes of finding idols of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>. They do not conduct travellers into the places where they have found more precious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>.

In a journey into Egypt made by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MENANDER\">Menander</a> de Chaulnes, he advanced very far into these winding labyrinths, sometimes crawling, and sometimes scrambling on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KNEES\">knees</a>. Informed by Mr Edward Worley Montague, who has carefully visited Egypt, he arrived at one of those passages which had an opening shut up from without by branches of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATE\">date</a> tree interwoven, and covered with sand. He remarked there some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIEROGLYPHICS\">hieroglyphics</a> in relief, executed in the highest perfection. But the Arabs refused every offer he made them to permit him to take drawings of them, or to mould them, in order to preserve their form. The duke de Chaulnes is of opinion that these hieroglyphics, sculptured with so much art that the objects they represent may be discovered at the first sight, might possibly furnish the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KEY\">key</a> of the others, whose contours are simply expressed, and form a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALPHABET\">alphabet</a> of this unintelligible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>.

Pliny informs us, that the kings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> and Macedon gave a noble testimony of his merit, by sending ambassadors to invite him to their courts, and even fleets to bring him over; but that Menander was so much of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, as to prefer the free enjoyment of his studies to the promised favours of the great. Of his works, which amounted to above 100 comedies, we have had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> loss, the originals being not only vanished, but the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of them, when copied by Terence, having unfortunately perished by shipwreck before they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> Rome. Yet the four plays which Terence borrowed from him before that accident happened, are still preserved in the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>; and it is chiefly from Terence that most people form their judgement of Menander, the fragments that remain of him not being sufficient to enable them to do it. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> have paid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> things of Menander; and we find the old masters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHETORIC\">rhetoric</a> recommending his works as the true patterns of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> of public speaking.

The pliancy of his character, his soft, modest, and obliging disposition, gained him the esteem alike of the superstitious and of the incredulous.

Innocent III. was the first of the popes who perceived the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of instituting such an order; and accordingly he gave such monastic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a>, as made a pretension of poverty, the most distinguishing marks of his protection and favour. They were also encouraged and patronized by the succeeding pontiffs, when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> had demonstrated their public and extensive usefulness. But when it became generally known, that they had such a peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in the esteem and protection of the rulers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, their number grew to such an enormous and unwieldy multitude, and swarmed so prodigiously in all the European provinces, that they became a burden, not only to the people, but to the church itself. The great inconvenience that arose from the excessive multiplication of the mendicant orders was remedied by Gregory X. in a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>, which he assembled at Lyons in 1272. For here all the religious orders that had sprung up after the council held at Rome in 1215, under the pontificate of Innocent III. were suppressed; and the extravagant multitude of mendicants, as Gregory called them, were reduced to a smaller number, and confined to the four following societies or denominations, viz. the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMINICANS\">Dominicans</a>, the Franciscans, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARMELITES\">Carmelites</a>, and the Augustins or hermits of St. Augustine.\n\nAs the pontiffs allowed these four mendicant orders the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> of travelling wherever they thought proper, of conversing with persons of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, of instructing the youth and multitude wherever they went; and as those monks exhibited, in their outward appearance and manner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, more striking marks of gravity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLINESS\">holiness</a> than were observable in the other monastic societies, they rose all at once to the very summit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>, and were regarded with the utmost esteem and veneration through all the countries of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. The enthusiastic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to these sanctimonious beggars went so far, that, as we learn from the most authentic records, several cities were divided or cantoned out into four parts, with a view to these four orders; the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> being assigned to the Dominicans, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> to the Franciscans, the third to the Carmelites, and the fourth to the Augustins. The people were unwilling to receive the sacraments from any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> than those of the mendicants, to whose churches they crowded to perform their devotions, while living, and were extremely delirious to depose there also their remains after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>: nor did the influence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> of the mendicants end here; for we find in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of this and of the succeeding ages, that they were employed, not only in spiritual matters, but also in temporal and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> affairs of the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, in composing the differences of princes, concluding treaties of peace, concerting alliances, presiding in cabinet councils, governing courts, levying taxes, and other occupations, not only remote from, but absolutely inconsistent with, the monastic character and profession. However, the power of the Dominicans and Franciscans greatly surpassed that of the other two orders: in much that these two orders were, before the Reformation, what the Jesuits have been since that happy and glorious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIERARCHY\">hierarchy</a>, the engines of the state, the secret <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> of all the motions of the one and the other, and the authors and directors of every great and important event, both in the religious and political world. By very quick progression their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> and confidence arrived at such a pitch, that they had the presumption to declare publicly, that they had a divine impulse and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> to illustrate and maintain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a>; they treated with the utmost insolence and contempt all the different orders of the priesthood; they affirmed, without a blush, that the true method of obtaining <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SALVATION\">salvation</a> was revealed to them alone; proclaimed, with ostentation, the superior efficacy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of their indulgencies; and vaunted beyond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>, and their familiar connexions with the Supreme Being, the Virgin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>, and the saints in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>. By these impious wiles, they so deluded and captivated the miserable, and blinded the multitude, that they would not intrust any other but the mendicants with the care of their souls. They retained their credit and influence to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of the 14th century, that great numbers of both sexes, some in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, others in a state of infirmity, and others at the point of death, earnestly desired to be admitted into the mendicant order, which they looked upon as a sure and infallible method of rendering heaven propitious. Many made it an essential part of their last wills, that their bodies after death should be wrapped in old ragged Dominican or Franciscan habits, and interred among the mendicants. For such was the barbarous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> and wretched <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, that people universally believed they should readily obtain mercy from Christ, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of judgement, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they appeared before his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBUNAL\">tribunal</a> associated with the mendicant friars.\n\nAbout this time, however, they fell under an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> odium; but being resolutely protected against all opposition, whether open or secret, by the popes, who regarded them as their best friends and most effectual supports, they suffered little or nothing from the efforts of their numerous adversaries. In the 15th century,\ncentury, besides their arrogance, which was excessive, a quarrelsome and litigious spirit prevailed among them, and drew upon them justly the displeasure and indignation of many. By affording refuge at this time to the Beguins in their order, they became offensive to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a>, and were hereby involved in difficulties and perplexities of various kinds. They lost their credit in the 16th century by their rustic impudence, their ridiculous superstitions, their ignorance, cruelty, and brutish manners. They discovered the most barbarous aversion to the arts and sciences, and expressed a like abhorrence of certain eminent and learned men, who endeavoured to open the paths of science to the pursuits of the studious youth, recommended the culture of the mind, and attacked the barbarism of the age in their writings and discourses. Their general character, together with other circumstances, concurred to render a reformation desirable, and to accomplish this happy event.\n\nAmong the number of mendicants are also ranked the Capuchins, Recollets, Minims, and others, who are branches or derivations from the former.\n\nBuchanan tells us, the mendicants in Scotland, under an appearance of beggary, lived a very luxurious life; whence one wittily called them, not Mendicant but Monducati friars.","sp":110,"ep":111},{"h":"MENECRATES","t":"a physician of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRACUSE\">Syracuse</a>, who flourished about 365 B.C. is famous for his skill in his profession, but much more for his vanity.

The writings of Menno, which are almost all composed in the Dutch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, were published in folio at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMSTERDAM\">Amsterdam</a> in the year 1651. About the year 1627, Menno was earnestly solicited by many of the sect with which he connected himself, to assume among them the rank and functions of a public teacher; and as he looked upon the persons who made this proposal to be exempt from the fanatical frenzy of their brethren at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUNSTER\">Munster</a> (though according to other accounts they were originally of the same stamp, only rendered somewhat wiser by their sufferings), he yielded to their entreaties. From this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> to the end of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, he travelled from one country to another with his wife and children, exercising his ministry, under persecutions and calamities of various kinds, that succeeded each other without interruption, and constantly exposed to the danger of falling a victim to the severity of the laws. East and West Friesland, together with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRONINGEN\">Groningen</a>, were first visited by this zealous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOSTLE\">apostle</a> of the Anabaptists; from whence he directed his course into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, Guelderland, Brabant, and Westphalia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> it through the German provinces that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> on the coasts of the Baltic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, and penetrated as far as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVONIA\">Livonia</a>. In all these places his ministerial labours were attended with remarkable success, and added to his sect a prodigious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of followers. Hence he is deservedly considered as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of almost all the Anabaptists, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> of the sect that still subsists under that denomination. Menno was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of genius, undirected by a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> judgment; he possessed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> and persuasive eloquence, and such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of learning as made him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> for an oracle in the estimation of the multitude. He appears, moreover, to have been a man of probity, of a meek and tractable spirit, gentle in his manners, pliable and obsequious in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> with persons of all ranks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>, and extremely zealous in promoting practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, which he recommended by his example as well as by his precepts. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of doctrine and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> drawn up by Menno was of a much more mild and moderate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> than that of the furious and fanatical Anabaptists, whose tumultuous proceedings have been recited under that article, but somewhat more severe, though more clear and confident, than the doctrine of the wiser branches of that sect, who aimed at nothing more than the restoration of the Christian church to its primitive purity. Accordingly he condemned the plan of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> discipline that was founded on the prospect of a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, to be miraculously established by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> Christ on the ruins of civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> and the destruction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> rulers, and which had been the fatal and pestilential source of such dreadful commotions, such execrable rebellions, and such enormous crimes. He declared publicly his dislike of that doctrine, which pointed out the approach of a marvellous reformation in the church by the means of a new and extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFUSION\">effusion</a> of the Holy Spirit. He expressed his abhorrence of the licentious tenets, which several of the Anabaptists had maintained, with respect to the unlawfulness of polygamy and divorce; and finally, considered as unworthy of toleration those fanatics who were of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that the Holy Ghost continued to descend into the minds of many chosen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEVERS\">believers</a>, in as extraordinary a manner as he did at the first establishment of the Christian church, and that he testified this peculiar presence to several of the faithful by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">miracles</a>, predictions, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a>, and visions of various kinds. He retained indeed the doctrines <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> received among the Anabaptists, in relation to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAPTISM\">baptism</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLENNIUM\">millennium</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> 1000 years reign of Christ upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> of magistrates from the Christian church, the abolition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, and the prohibition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OATHS\">oaths</a> enjoined by our Saviour, and the vanity as well as the pernicious effects of human science. But while Menno retained these doctrines in a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, he explained and modified them in such a manner as made them resemble the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> tenets that were universally received in the Protestant churches; and this rendered them agreeable to many, and made them appear inoffensive even to numbers who had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> inclination to embrace them. It however so happened, that the nature of the doctrines considered in themselves, the eloquence of Menno which set them off to such advantage, and the circumstances of the times, gave a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> to the religious system of this famous teacher among the Anabaptists, so that it made a rapid progress in that sect. And thus it was in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the ministry of Menno, that the different sorts of Anabaptists agreed together in excluding from their communion the fanatics that dishonoured it, and in renouncing all tenets that were detrimental to the authority of civil government, and by an unexpected coalition formed themselves into one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>.\n\nThough the Mennonites usually pass for a sect of Anabaptists, yet M. Herman Schyn, a Mennonite minister, who has published their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> and apology, maintains, that they are not Anabaptists either in principle or by origin. However, nothing can be more certain than this fact, viz. that the first Mennonite congregations were composed of the different sorts of Anabaptists, of those who had been always inoffensive and upright, and of those who, before their conversion by the ministry of Menno, had been factious fanatics; besides, it is alleged, that the Mennonites,\nMEN\n\nThe Mennonites do actually retain, at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, some of their opinions and doctrines, which led the sedulous and turbulent Anabaptists of old to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> of so many and such enormous crimes; such particularly is the doctrine concerning the nature of Christ's kingdom, or of the church of the New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>, though modified in such a manner as to have lost its noxious qualities, and to be no longer pernicious in its influence.\n\nThe Mennonites are subdivided into several sects; whereof the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> are the Flandrians or Flemings, and the Waterlandians. The opinions, says Molheim, that are held in common by the Mennonites, seem to be all derived from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> principle, that the kingdom which Christ established upon earth is a visible church or community, into which the holy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> alone are to be admitted, and which is consequently exempt from all those institutions and rules of discipline that have been invented by human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>, for the correction and reformation of the wicked. This principle, indeed, was avowed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Mennonites, but it is now almost wholly renounced: nevertheless, from this ancient doctrine, many of the religious opinions that distinguish the Mennonites from all other Christian communities, seem to be derived: in consequence of this doctrine, they admit none to the sacrament of baptism but persons that are come to the full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of their reason; they neither admit civil rulers into their communion, nor allow any of their members to perform the functions of magistracy; they deny the lawfulness of repelling force by force, and consider war, in all its shapes, as unchristian and unjust; they entertain the utmost aversion to the execution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, and more especially to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> punishments; and they also refuse to confirm their testimony by an oath. The particular sentiments that divided the more considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a> of the Mennonites are the following: The rigid Mennonites, called the Flemings, maintain with various degrees of rigour, the opinions of their founder Menno, as to the human nature of Christ, alleging that it was produced in the womb of the Virgin by the creating power of the Holy Ghost; the obligation that binds us to wash the feet of strangers, in consequence of our Saviour's command; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of excommunicating and avoiding, as one would do the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a>, not only avowed sinners, but also all those who depart, even in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> instances pertaining to dress, &c., from the simplicity of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>; the contempt due to human learning, and other matters of less moment. However this austere system declines, and the rigid Mennonites are gradually approaching towards the opinions and discipline of the more moderate or Waterlandians.\n\nThe first settlement of the Mennonites, in the United Provinces, was granted them by William <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">Orange</a>, towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of the 16th century; but it was not before the following century that their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> and tranquillity were fixed upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> foundations, when, by a confession of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> published in the year 1626, they cleared themselves from the imputations of those pernicious and detestable errors that had been laid to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>. In order to appease their intestine discords, a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the Anabaptists of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLANDERS\">Flanders</a>, Germany, and Friesland, concluded their debates in a conference held at Amsterdam, in the year 1630, and entered into the bonds of fraternal communion, each referring to themselves a liberty of retaining certain opinions. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a> was renewed and confirmed by new resolutions, in the year 1649; in consequence of which the rigorous laws of Menno and his successors were, in various respects, mitigated and corrected.","sp":111,"ep":113},{"h":"MENOLOGY","t":"MENOLOGIUM, (from \u03bc\u03ae\u03bd, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, and \u1f00\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03ac, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a>), is much the same as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARTYROLOGY\">martyrology</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALENDAR\">calendar</a>, in the Latin.\n\nThe Greek menologium is divided into the several months in the year; and contains an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-ABRIDGMENT\">abridgment</a> of the lives of the saints, with a bare enumeration of the names of such whose lives were never written.

He and the Augustins of Mentz and Francfort have the exclusive enjoyment of the best Hockheimer wine, of which, in good years, a piece, consisting of 100 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>, sells for from 900 to 1000 guilders from the press. \"This (says the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> Riesbeck) is certainly one of the dearest wines in the world.

Bingen is a pleasant town, which stands in the district called Rhinegau. This town, which, together with the toll on the Rhine, is worth about 30,000 guilders, belongs to the chapter of Mentz, is extremely beautiful, and contains about 4500 inhabitants. A great part of the corn which is carried into the Rhinegau from the neighbouring Palatinate, comes through this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, which, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, supplies the Palatinate with drugs, and various foreign commodities. This traffic alone would make the place very lively; but, besides this, it has very fruitful vineyards. The hill, at the foot of which it lies, and one side of which is made by the gullet through which the Nahe runs into the Rhine, forms another steep rock behind this gullet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the Rhine and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> Rudelheimer mountain; it therefore enjoys the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> as this does, which makes the Budelfheimer wine that grows on it little inferior to the Rudelheimer. See RUDELSHEIM. The rising grounds about it produce wines that are esteemed preferable to those of Baccharac, so much in vogue heretofore.\u20143. Elfeld, five miles west from Mentz, is a strong fortified town, on the north side of the Rhine, and the chief of the Rhinegau.\u2014Here is Rudelheim, a place noted for the growth of the best wines in these parts. 4. Weibaden lies between six and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> leagues from Francfort, and about five <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> six miles north of Mentz; it is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a> of a country belonging to the branch of Naflau-Saarbrak, and is famous for its mineral waters.\n\nAccording to Riesbeck, the fee of Mentz is indebted for its increase of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> to St Boniface, who may be called, with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOSTLE\">apostle</a> of the Germans. It was this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, an Englishman by birth, who in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLEMAGNE\">Charlemagne</a> baptized Witikini and the other brave Saxons who had so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> refused <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAPTISM\">baptism</a> with their swords, and spread the empire of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VICAR\">vicar</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> Christ as far as the northern and eastern seas. He it was who introduced the Roman liturgy into Germany, and made the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> inhabitants abstain from eating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>. He raised the papal power to a higher pitch than it had been raised in any other country in Christendom; and, in recompense of his services, the pope made all the newly founded bishoprics in the north of Germany subject to the see of Mentz, which Boniface\nMentz <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> had chosen for his residence. The provinces, the most considerable in the whole papal dominions, all Suabia, Franconia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOHEMIA\">Bohemia</a>, and almost all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAXONY\">Saxony</a>, with a part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAVARIA\">Bavaria</a>, and the Upper Rhine, belong to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIOCESE\">diocese</a>. Though the reformation, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> of the kings of Bohemia, have lessened it one-third, it still contains the archbishopric of Sprengel, and eleven bishoprics, most of which are the most considerable of Germany, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WURZBURG\">Wurzburg</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PADERBORN\">Paderborn</a>, Hildeheim, Augsburg, &c. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> of the papal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a> was completed by Gregory VII., the archbishops of Mentz became powerful enough to be at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the empire. In the 13th and 14th centuries, they were so eminent as to be able to make emperors without any foreign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a>; and it was to one of them that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of Hapburg was indebted for its first elevation. Since the boundaries of the two powers have been more accurately ascertained, and the temporal has so much got the better of the spiritual, the power and influence of the archbishops of this place have of course been much reduced; still, however, they are possessed of very important prerogatives, which they might exert with much more efficacy than they do, were it not that various circumstances have rendered them too dependent on the emperors. They are still the speakers in the electoral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a>, have the appointment of the diets under the emperors, and may order a re-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the proceedings of the imperial courts. These <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> privileges are, however, too much subject to the control of the house of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-AUSTRIA\">Austria</a>; nor are their spiritual powers any longer what they once were. Their suffragan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a> have taken it into their heads that all bishops are alike as to power, and that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> only entitles its possessor to the first place amongst brothers who are equal. The temporals, however, which are still annexed to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a>, make him who sits in it rich amends for the diminution of his spiritual and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> splendor. Though he does not absolutely possess the largest, yet he certainly has the richest and most peopled domain of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> potentate in Germany. The country, it is true, does not contain more than 125 German miles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, whereas the archbishopric of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALZBURG\">Salzburg</a> contains 240; but then Salzburg has only 250,000 inhabitants, whereas Mentz has 320,000. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> riches of the territory of Mentz, and its advantageous situation, make a subject of Mentz much richer than one of Salzburg, the greatest part of which is only inhabited by herdsmen. In the territory of Mentz there are 40 cities; in that of Salzburg only seven. The tax on vellots which go <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the Rhine of itself produces 60,000 guilders, or 6000l. a-year, which is nearly as much as all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> of Salzburg put together, excepting only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> mine at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALLE\">Halle</a>. The tax on wine, here and in the country round, produces the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> above 100,000 guilders, or 10,000l. a-year, in which sum we do not reckon the customs of the countries which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> at a greater distance. Upon the whole, the income of the present archbishop may be valued at 1,700,000 guilders, or 170,000l.\n\nIf the lands of the elector lay all together, they would produce a sufficiency of corn and all the prime necessaries of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>; but as several parts of them lie wide afield, the people are compelled to purchase a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> from foreigners. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> itself, as well as the adjacent Rhinegau, depends on the Palatinate for its corn, notwithstanding the great abundance of that and every other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of grain in its own possessions in Wetterau. The noblest production of the elector's territory on the Rhine is the wine, which is almost the only true Rhenish. Connoisseurs, indeed, allow the wines of Neirittein, Baccarach, and a very few other places out of this country, to be true Rhenish; but they do not give this name to the wines of the Palatinate, of Bardon, and of Altatia. There is a great deal of wine made in the countries which lie on the south and west of the Rhine, at Laubenheim, Bodenheim, Budenheim, and Bingen; but the true Rhenish, that which inspires so many who are and so many who are not poets, comes only from the Rhinegau, which lies on the northern banks of the Rhine. See Rhinegau.\n\nThe civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of the archbishop (according to Baron Riesbeck), is by much too immoderate and expensive. \"He has his ministers, his counsellors of state, and eighty or ninety privy counsellors of various denominations. The expense of this establishment is very disproportionate to the revenue of the state. This is owing to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>, who can only accept of employments of this kind. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">Ignorance</a> of the true principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> are the causes of this evil. The consequences are, that a great number of persons, who might be usefully employed, live in idleness. Even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> establishment of the country appears to me more calculated for the purpose of feeding a hungry nobility than for real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>. At the accession of the present elector, though the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> only consisted of 2200 men, there were six generals. The regular establishment paid for and supported by the country is 8000 men; but though there are only 2000 men kept up, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> expended for their support, particularly that given to numberless useless officers, might be made use of more for the benefit of the country. The army of the archbishop consists of a German <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> of 50 men and 25 horses, a Swiss guard, a squadron of hussars of 130 men (the most useful troops, as they purge the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> of robbers and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MURDERERS\">murderers</a>), a corps of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a> of 104 men, three regiments of infantry of 600 men each, and some companies belonging to the armies of Franconia and the Upper Palatinate. Of the fortifications of the capital we may say much the same as of the army. Were they, indeed, improved and kept up as they ought to be, they would vie with Luxemburg, and be the most powerful of all the barriers against France. It is true, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the ground does not allow of a regular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>; but for single parts, I have seen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> place of the same capabilities, where greater advantages have been taken of the ground for the erection of the several works. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, as well as size of them, is indeed an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of great wonder; but though the circle of the Upper Rhine, and even the empire in general, has laid out great sums on the building these fortifications, parts of them are not finished, and parts of them are ready to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> to pieces. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, indeed, would require a great army to man them. But this, as well as the maintaining and keeping them up, is evidently beyond the power of this court, or indeed of the whole circle of\nof the Upper Rhine united. They are, therefore, also to be looked upon as one of the things which serve more for magnificence than real use.\"\n\nMentz, a considerable town of Germany, in the circle of the Lower Rhine, and capital of the electorate of the same name, is situated on the Rhine near its confluence with the Maine, 20 miles north west of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">Worms</a>, 15 west of Frankfort, and 75 east of Trier, in E. Long. 8\u00b0 20' N. Lat. 49\u00b0 51'. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> claims a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a>: (see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of Printing). Here is a very beautiful quay along the river, defended by several works well fortified with cannon. That part of the city which extends towards the river is most populous. The best vineyards for Rhenish wine being in this neighbourhood, Mentz has a flourishing trade in that commodity more particularly; and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> is the brisker, by reason that all the merchandise which passes up and down the Rhine stops in its harbour to change bottoms.\n\nThe northern part of the city, in which the archbishop resides, is full of very regular buildings. Here are three regular streets, called the Bleichen, which run parallel to each other from the banks of the Rhine to 600 yards within the city, and are cut almost regularly by very pretty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> streets. The archbishop's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> has a most commanding view of these streets, the Rhine, and the Rhinegaun. There are also some good buildings in the old part of the city. The market of beasts is extremely well worth seeing; and you here and there meet with other agreeable spots. The market in the middle of the town, though not regular, is one of the prettiest places in Germany. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a> is well worth notice. It is an immense large old Gothic building, the spire of which was struck with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a> about 20 years ago, and entirely laid in ashes. As it was made of a forest of wood, it burned 14 hours before it was entirely consumed. To prevent these accidents for the future, the chapter had the present one built to the same height in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, an undertaking which cost them 40,000 guilders or 4000l. It is a great pity (Baron Riefbeck observes) that it is overloaded with small ornaments: and a still greater, that this wonderful edifice is so choked up with shops and houses as to be hardly more than half visible. As, however, houses and shops are very dear in this part of the town, one cannot be very angry with the chapter for choosing rather to make the most of its ground, than to show off the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> to the best advantage. The rent of a shop and a single room to live in is 150 guilders or 15l. per annum in this part of the town. There is hardly another church in Germany of the height and length of this cathedral; and the inside of it is decorated with several magnificent monuments of princes and other great personages. Besides the cathedral, the city of Mentz contains several other churches in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> style, very well worth seeing. St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a>'s, and the Jesuits church, though both too much loaded with ornament, are among this number. The church of the Augustins, of which the inhabitants of Mentz are so proud, is a masterpiece of bad taste; but that of Ignatius, though little is said about it, would be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> of the antique, if here likewise there had not been too much ornament lavished. Upon the whole, the palaces of the noblesse want that noble Mentz simplicity which alone constitutes true beauty and magnificence. In another century the externals of the city <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be quite changed. The late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> built a great deal, and the present has a taste for the same sort of expense. The monks and governors of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a> also have been forced to rebuild their houses; so that when a few more streets are made broader and straighter, the whole will have no bad appearance. The inhabitants, who together with the garrison amount to 30,000, are a good kind of people, and, like all the catholics of Germany, make great account of a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>. Their faces are interesting, and they are not deficient either in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>.\n\nThere are few cities in Germany besides <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a> which contain so rich and numerous a nobility as this does: there are some houses here which have estates of 100,000 guilders, or 10,000l. a-year. The counts of Bassenheim, Schonborn, Stadion, Ingelheim, Elz, Offstein, and Walderdorf, and the lords of Dahlberg, Breitenbach, with some others, have incomes of from 30,000 to 100,000 guilders. Sixteen or eighteen houses have from 15,000 to 30,000 guilders annual revenue.\u2014The nobility of this place are said to be some of the oldest and most untainted in Germany. There are amongst them many persons of extraordinary merit, who join uncommon knowledge to all the duties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> life. Upon the whole, they are far superior to the greater part of the German nobility. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, however, is still too stiff. The first minister of the court was refused admittance into their assemblies for not being sufficiently noble; and they think they degrade themselves by keeping <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> with bourgeois.\n\nThe clergy of this place are the richest in Germany. A canonry brings in 3500 Rhenish guilders in a moderate year. The canonry of the provost brings him in 40,000 guilders a-year; and each of the deaneries is worth 2600 guilders. The income of the chapter altogether amounts to 300,000 guilders. Though it is forbidden by the canons of the church for any one to have more than a single prebend, there is not an ecclesiastic in this place who has not three or four; so that there is hardly a man amongst them who has not at least 8000 guilders a-year. The last provost, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> of Elz, had prebends enough to procure him an income of 75,000 guilders. Exclusive of the cathedral, there are several other choirs in which the canonries bring in from 1200 to 1500 guilders a-year. To give an idea of the riches of the monasteries of this place, Baron Riefbeck informs us, that at the destruction of the Jesuits, their wine, which was reckoned to sell extremely cheap, produced 120,000 rixdollars. A little while ago the elector abolished one Carthusian convent and two nunneries, in the holy cellars of which there was found wine for at least 500,000 rixdollars. \"Notwithstanding this great wealth (continues our author), there is not a more regular clergy in all Germany. There is no diocese, in which the regulations made by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENT\">Trent</a> have been more strictly adhered to than they have here; the archbishops having made a particular point of it both at the time of the reformation and ever since. One thing which greatly contributes to keep up <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> is the not suffering any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> to remain in the country who\nwho has not fixed and flated duties, and a revenue annexed to them. Most of the irregularities in Bavaria, Austria, and other countries, arise from abb\u00e9s who are obliged to subsist by their daily industry and many mistakes which they can pick up. These creatures are entirely unknown here. The theological tenets of this court are also much purer than those of any other ecclesiastical prince in Germany. I was pleased to see the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIBLE\">Bible</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of so many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> people, especially in the country. I was told that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> of it was not forbidden in any part of the diocese; only persons were enjoined not to read it through, without the advice of their confessors. For a long time <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> has been hunted through its utmost recesses; and though it is not quite possible to get entirely clear of pilgrimages and wonder-working images, you will meet with no priest bold enough to exorcise or to preach such nonsense as we hear in the pulpits of other German churches.\"\n\nThough the trade of this place has been constantly on the increase for these 18 or 20 years past, yet it is by no means what it ought to be from the situation and other advantages. The persons here who call themselves <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a>, and who make any considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, are in fact only brokers, who procure their livelihood at the expense of the country or territory round, or who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> for the merchants of Frankfort. A few toy-shops, five or fix druggists, and four or five manufacturers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a>, are all that can possibly be called traders. There is not a banker in the whole town; and yet this country enjoys the staple privilege, and commands by means of the Maine, Neckar, and Rhine, all the exports and imports of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALSACE\">Alsace</a>, the Palatinate, Franconia, and a part of Swabia and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HESSE\">Hesse</a>, as far as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NETHERLANDS\">Netherlands</a>. The port too is constantly filled with ships, but few of them contain any merchandise belonging to the inhabitants of the place. The French took it by surprise in October 1792; it surrendered to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUSSIA\">Prussia</a> in 1793; the French made a fruitless attack upon it in 1795; it was relieved from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCKADE\">blockade</a> by the Austrians in 1796, and the French got possession of it in October 1797.","sp":132,"ep":139},{"h":"MENTZEL","t":"CHRISTIAN, born at Frustenwall in the Mittel-mark, is celebrated for his skill in medicine and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">botany</a>, in pursuit of which he travelled through many countries.

He signalized himself in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLAND\">Poland</a> in 1708 and 1709; but in 1713 he was accused of embezzling the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, and fined in 300,000 crowns. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CZAR\">czar</a> remitted the fine; and having restored him to favour, gave him the command of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> in the Ukraine in 1719, and sent him as his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a> into Poland in 1722. Constantly employed about the means of preserving his influence after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of his master, who was then evidently on the decline, Menzikoff discovered the person to whom the czar intended to leave the succession. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> was highly offended, and his penetration cost him the principality of Pleckoff. Under the czarina Catherine, however, he was higher in favour than ever; because, on the death of the czar in 1725, he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> in bringing different parties in Russia to agree to her succession. This princess was not ungrateful. In appointing her son-in-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> Peter II. to be her successor, she commanded him to marry the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Menzikoff, and gave the czar's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FILLET\">fillet</a> to his son. The parties were actually betrothed: and Menzikoff was made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Cozel and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEWARD\">steward</a> to the czar. But this summit of elevation was the prelude to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>. The Dolgoroukis, favourites of the czar, had influence enough to procure his banishment, together with that of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, to one of his own estates at the distance of 250 leagues from Moscow. He had the imprudence to leave the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> with the splendour and magnificence of a governor going to take possession of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>. His enemies took advantage of this circumstance to inflame the indignation of the czar. At some distance from Moscow he was overtaken by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DETACHMENT\">detachment</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>. The officer who commanded them made him alight from his chariot, which he sent back to Moscow; and placed him and his whole family in covered waggons, to be conducted into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a>, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of peasants. When he arrived at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of his destination, he was presented with cows and sheep big with young, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POULTRY\">poultry</a>, without knowing from whom he received the favour. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> was a simple cottage; and his employment was to cultivate the ground, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> to superintend its cultivation. New causes of sorrow were added to the sufferings of exile. His wife died in the journey; he had the misfortune to lose...\nMENZINI one of his daughters by the smallpox; and his other two children were seized with the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, but recovered. He sunk under his misfortunes, November 2, 1729; and was buried beside his daughter, in a little chapel which he had built. His misfortunes had inspired him with sentiments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a>, which, amid the splendor of his former situation, he had altogether neglected. His two surviving children enjoyed greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> after the death of their father. The officer permitted them to attend public worship on Sundays by turns. One <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> when his daughter was returning from the village, she heard herself accosted by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEASANT\">peasant</a> from the window of a cottage, and, to her great surprize, recognized in this peasant the persecutor of her family, Dolgorouki; who, in his turn, had fallen a sacrifice to the intrigues of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>. She communicated this intelligence to her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, who could not behold, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMOTION\">emotion</a>, this new instance of the vanity and instability of honours and power. Young Menzikooff and his sister were soon after recalled to Moscow by the czarina <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNA\">Anna</a>; and left Dolgorouki in possession of their cottage. He was made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a> of the guards, and received the fifth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his father's possessions.

Maknassia, its founder, built it first at the bottom of a valley; but Muley Idriss extended it considerably over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> that lies to the west of the valley. It is surrounded with well cultivated fields and hills, adorned with gardens and olive plantations, and abundantly watered with rivulets. Accordingly, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KITCHEN\">kitchen</a> stuffs thrive here exceedingly, and even the superior urbanity of the inhabitants announces the temperature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>. The winter indeed is very inconvenient, on account of the dirtiness of the town, the streets not being paved, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> being slimy.\n\nMequinez is surrounded with walls; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> itself is fortified with two battions, on which formerly some small guns were mounted. Muley Idriss, and Muley <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABDALLAH\">Abdallah</a>, often in this city resisted the efforts of the Berbes, the sworn enemies of their tyranny. To the west are seen some walls of circumvallation, five feet in height, which were probably <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> intrenchments for the infantry; the attacks of the Berbes being only sudden and momentary inroads, which did not require a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>. There is at Mequinez, as well as at Morocco, a walled and guarded suburb for the Jews. The housetops are neater here than at Morocco. The Jews here are more numerous; and they can turn their industry to greater account, because the Moors in this city are more polished, and (being nearer to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>) more civilized, than those in the Southern parts. Near the Jewry, there is another enclosed and separate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, called the Negro town. It was built by Muley Idriss, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a> of those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> families which composed his soldiery. This town is now uninhabited, as are all those destined for the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> through the rest of the empire.\n\nAt the south-east extremity of the city stands the palace of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a>, which was built by Muley Idriss. The space occupied by this palace is very great; it includes several gardens, elegantly disposed, and well watered. There is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> garden in the centre, surrounded by a vast and pretty regular gallery, resting on columns, which communicates with the apartments. Those of the women are very spacious, and have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with a large chamber which looks into the garden. As you <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> from one apartment to another, you find at intervals regular courts paved with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> pieces of black and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> marble; in the middle of these courts is a marble basin, from the centre of which rises a jet d'eau, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> falls <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> into this basin. These fountains are numerous in the palace; they are useful for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> purposes, and they serve for the ablutions, which the scruples of the Mahometans have exceedingly multiplied. The palaces of the Moorish kings are large, because they are composed only of one range of apartments; these are long and narrow, from 18 to 20 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>; they have few ornaments, and receive the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> by two large folding doors, which are opened more or less as occasion requires. The rooms are always lighted from a square <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> in the centre, which is generally encompassed with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLONNADE\">colonnade</a>.\n\nThe Moors here are more courteous than those in the southern parts; they are civil to strangers, and invite them into their gardens, which are very neat. The women in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the empire are beautiful; they have a fair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a>, with fine black eyes, and white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>.

It comprehended well nigh 17 of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> counties, being equal in size to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUEDOC\">Languedoc</a> in France; very little, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> at all, less than the kingdom of Arragon in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>; and superior in size to that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOHEMIA\">Bohemia</a> in Germany.\n\nPenda is regarded as its first monarch; and the kingdom is thought to derive its name from the Saxon word *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a>*, which signifies \"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">march</a>, bound, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> limit,\" because the other kingdoms bordered upon it on every side; and not from the river Mersey, as some would persuade us. Penda assumed the regal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> A.D. 626, and was of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of 50 at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of his accession; after which he reigned near 30 years. He was of a most furious and turbulent temper, breaking at different times with almost all his neighbours, calling in the Britons to his assistance, and shedding more Saxon blood than had been hitherto spilled in all their intestine quarrels. He killed two kings of Northumberland, three of the East Angles, and compelled Kenwalh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of the West Saxons to quit his dominions. He was at length slain, with most of the princes of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, and a multitude of his subjects, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> fought not far from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEEDS\">Leeds</a>, by Oswy king of Northumberland. This battle, which the Saxon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRONICLE\">chronicle</a> tells us was fought at Winnidfield, A.D. 655, made a great change in the Saxon affairs, which the unbridled fury of Penda had thrown into great confusion. He had the year before killed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNA\">Anna</a> king of the East Angles in battle, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ETHELRED\">Ethelred</a> notwithstanding took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> with Penda. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, Penda the eldest son of Penda, to whom his father had given the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> kingdom of the Mid Angles, had two years before married the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of King Oswy, and had been baptized at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>. At that time it should seem that Oswy and Penda were upon good terms; but after the latter had conquered the East Angles, he resolved to turn his arms against the kingdom of Northumberland. Oswy by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> means had provoked this rupture; on the contrary, Bede tells us that he offered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> sums of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, and jewels of great value, to purchase peace: these offers being rejected, he was reduced to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of deciding the quarrel by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>. The river near which the battle was fought overflowing, there were more drowned than killed. Amongst these, as the Saxon chronicle says, there were 35 princes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> line, some of whom bore the title of kings; and also Ethelred king of the East Angles, who fought on the side of Penda against his family and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>.\n\nHis son Penda, who married the daughter of that conqueror, became a Christian, and was not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> after murdered, as is said, by the malice of his mother. His brother Wolfher becoming king of Mercia, embraced in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of time the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> of the gospel, and proved a very victorious and potent monarch; and is, with no fewer than seven of his immediate successors, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> styled king of the Anglo-Saxons, though none of them are owned in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> by the Saxon chronicle. But though possibly none of them might enjoy this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>, they were undoubtedly very illustrious princes, maintaining great wars, and obtaining many advantages over the sovereigns of other Saxon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, and especially the East Angles, whom they reduced. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the Mercian territories was so ample as to admit, and so situated as to require, the constituting subordinate rulers in several provinces; to whom, especially if they were of the royal line, they gave the title of kings; which occasions some confusion in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>. Besides the establishing episcopal sees and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONVENTS\">convents</a>, the Saxon monarchs took other methods for improving and adorning their dominions; and as Mercia was the largest, so these methods were most conspicuous therein. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COVENTRY\">Coventry</a>, as being situated in the centre, was usually, but not always, the royal residence. Penda, who was almost continually in a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, lived as his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> operations directed, in some great town on the frontiers. Wolfher built a castle or fortified <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> for his own residence, which bore his name.\u2014Offa kept his court at Sutton Walls near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEREFORD\">Hereford</a>.\n\nIn each of the provinces there resided a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>; and if he was of the royal blood, had usually the title of king. Penda, at the time he married Oswy's daughter, had the title of king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEICESTERSHIRE\">Leicestershire</a>.\u2014Ethelred\nMercurial. Ethelred made his brother Morwald king of Hereford; who, dying without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>, bequeathed it to his younger brother Mercelm. The like honours were sometimes conferred upon the princesses; and hence, in Mercia especially, we occasionally read of vice-queens. By these means the laws were better executed, the obedience of the subjects more effectually secured, and the splendor of their residences constantly kept up and augmented.\n\nAt length, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> devolving sometimes on minors and sometimes on weak princes, intestine factions also prevailing, the force of this hitherto mighty kingdom began sensibly to decline. This falling out in the days of Egbert, the most prudent as well as the most potent monarch of the West Saxons, he took advantage of these circumstances; and having encouraged the East Angles to make an attempt for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> of their independence, he, in a conjecture every way favourable to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, broke with the Mercians, and after a short war obliged them to submit. But this was not an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> conquest, the kings of Mercia being allowed by him and his successors to retain their titles and dominions, till the invasion of the Danes put an end to their rule, when this kingdom had subsisted above 250 years; and when the Danes were afterwards expelled by the West Saxons, it sunk into a province, or rather was divided into many.","sp":141,"ep":143},{"h":"MERCURIALIS","t":"DOGS <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">MERCURY</a>; a genus of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> belonging to the dioecia class; and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> method ranking under the 38th order, Tricocceae.

The latter, he thinks, is very plainly the Atlaboras of the ancients; and Pliny says, that this stream encloses the left side of Mero\u00eb as the Nile does the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>, in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> we must suppose him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> southward from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a>, otherwise the words would not apply.\n\nWe are told by Diodorus Siculus, that Mero\u00eb had its name from a sister of Cambyses' <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>, who died there in the expedition undertaken by that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> against the Ethiopians. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> perished with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a> and thirst in the deserts beyond Mero\u00eb, which could not have happened <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they had reached Gojam, the latter being one of the most plentiful countries in the world. A further <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that Gojam cannot be the ancient Mero\u00eb, is, that the latter was enclosed between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> Nile and Atlaboras, while Gojam is almost entirely surrounded by the Nile. If the ancients were acquainted with Gojam, they must also have been acquainted with the fountains of the Nile, which we certainly know they were not. Pliny says that Mero\u00eb, the most considerable of all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> of the Nile, was called Atlaboras, from the name of its left channel, which cannot be supposed any other than the junction of the Nile and Athbara. He informs us moreover, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> was vertical twice in the year, viz. when proceeding northward he entered the 18th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of Taurus, and when returning he came to the 14th degree of Leo; but this could never be the case with Gojam, which lies in about 10 degrees <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> latitude.\n\nAgain, the poet Lucan describes Mero\u00eb by two circumstances which cannot apply to any other than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a> of Athbara. One is, that the inhabitants were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>; which was the case with the Gymnosophists and first inhabitants, and which has been the case with all the rest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to the Saracen conquest: but the inhabitants of Gojam, as well as the other Abyssinians, are fair, at least greatly different in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a> from the blacks; they are also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>-haired, and nobody imagined that they ever had philosophers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> science among them, which was eminently the case with the ancient inhabitants of Mero\u00eb. The other circumstance is, that the ebony tree grew in the island of Mero\u00eb, which at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> grows plentifully in the peninsula of Athbara, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the province of Kuara, but not in Gojam, where the tree could not subsist on account of the violent rains which take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> during six months of the year. Mr Bruce mentions another circumstance quoted from the poet Lucan, which likewise tends to prove the identity of Mero\u00eb and Athbara; viz. that though there are many trees in it, they afford <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>. This our traveller found by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, when returning from Abyssinia through Athbara. \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> (says he) is flat, and has very little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. The forests, though thick, afforded no sort of shade, the hunters for the sake of their sport, and the Arabs for destroying the flies, having set fire to all the dry grass and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHRUBS\">shrubs</a>; which falling with great rapidity in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> from east to west, though it had not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to destroy the trees, did yet wither, and occasion every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a> that was upon them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>, unless in those spaces where villages had been, and where water was. In such spots a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> spreading trees remained full of foliage; which, from their great height and being cleared of underwood, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in full verdure, loaded with large, projecting, and exuberant branches. But even here the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> that their shade afforded was very temporary, so as to allow us no time for enjoyment. The sun, so near the zenith, changed his azimuth so rapidly, that every few minutes I was obliged to change the carpet on which I lay, round the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> of the tree to which I had fled for shelter; and though I lay down to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> perfectly screened by the trunk or branches, I was presently awakened by the violent rays of a scorching sun, the shade having passed beyond me. In all other places, though we had travelled constantly in a forest, we never met with a tree that could shade us for a moment, the fire having deprived them of all their leaves.\" The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of Athbara is excessive, the thermometer having been observed at 119\u00b0: two of Mr Bruce's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> died of thirst, or at least of the consequences of drinking after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> thirst. The inhabitants live in the greatest misery, and are continually in danger from the neighbouring Arabs, who, by destroying and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> their corn, are able to reduce them to a starving condition. Notwithstanding all their disadvantages, however, they have a manufacture of coarse cotton towels, of a size <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> sufficient to go round the waist, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> current as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> throughout the whole country.","sp":146,"ep":146},{"h":"MEROM","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">Ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">Geography</a>.

Anciently a part of Laconia under Menelaus, and called Messene by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a>; interpreted by the scholiast, Messenica Regia. Messenii, the people, reduced to a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a> and subjection by the Spartans; Messenius, the epithet.\n\nThis country is famous in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, on account of the resistance made by the Messenians against the Spartans, and the exploits of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a> Arilomenes. The first hostilities commenced about the year 652 B.C. on what occasion is uncertain. Though the Messenians were inferior in the knowledge of the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> to the Spartans; yet, by keeping for some time on the defensive, they improved so much, that in three years time they found themselves in a capacity of giving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> to their enemies in the open Messenia field; nor did they appear to be in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> inferior either in courage or conduct: the war was therefore protracted, with various success, on both sides. At last, both consulted the oracle at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DELPHI\">Delphi</a>; and received for answer, \"that whoever should first dedicate 100 tripods in the temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> at Ithome, a strong hold of the Messenians, should be masters of the country.\" The inhabitants of Messenia, on hearing this, having <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> money to make the tripods of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, fell to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> them out in wood; but before this could be accomplished, a Spartan having got into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> by stratagem, dedicated 100 little tripods of clay; which threw the Messenians into such despair, that they at last submitted to the Spartans.\n\nThe new subjects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPARTA\">Sparta</a> were treated with the utmost barbarity by these cruel tyrants; so that a new war commenced under Arilomenes, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of unconquerable valour, and enthusiastically fond of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>. He perceived that the Argives and Arcadians, who were called the allies of the Lacedemonians, adhered to them only through fear of their power; but that in reality they hated them, and wished to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> the injuries they had done them. To these Arilomenes applied; and receiving an answer conformable to his wishes, he engaged his countrymen unanimously to take up arms. About a year after the revolt began, and before either party had received any auxiliaries, the Spartans and Messenians met at a village called Derca, where an obstinate engagement ensued. Arilomenes was conceived to have performed more than mortal achievements: in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> therefore, respect being also had to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a>, his countrymen unanimously saluted him king; which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> he modestly waved, alleging, that he took up arms to set them free, and not to make himself great; he consented, however, to accept the title of general, with a power of doing whatsoever he thought requisite for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of the public. Knowing well the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> in which he lived, he resolved to intimidate the Spartans, by showing them what he was sure they would take for an ill <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OMEN\">omen</a>. Disguising himself therefore, he went privately to the city, where, in the night, he hung up a shield on the wall of the temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINERVA\">Minerva</a>, with this inscription: Arilomenes dedicates this, out of the spoils of the Spartans, to the gods. It was easily perceived that this war would be both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and bloody; the Lacedemonians therefore sent deputies to Delphi, to inquire of the oracle concerning its event: the answer they received was, That it behoved the Spartans to seek a leader from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>. The Athenians naturally envious of the Spartans, granted their request indeed, but in such a manner as manifested their spite; for they sent them for a general Tyrtaeus, a schoolmaster and poet, lame of one foot, and who was suspected to be a little out of his wits. But here their skill failed them; for this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a>, notwithstanding his despicable appearance, proved of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> to Sparta, teaching them how to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> good, and how to bear up under ill fortune.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, Arilomenes had drawn together a mighty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, the Eleans, Argives, Sicyonians, and Arcadians, having sent troops to his assistance; the Spartans in this, as in the former war, having no ally but Corinth. The Spartan kings, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>,\ncustom of their city, no sooner took the field, than, notwithstanding their inferiority in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, they offered the enemy battle, which Aristomenes readily accepted. It was long, obstinate, and bloody; but in the end the Messenians were victorious, and the Lacedemonians put to flight with a great slaughter. It is scarce to be conceived how much the Spartans were struck with this defeat: they grew weary of the war, dissatisfied with their kings, dissident of their own power, and in a word sunk into a state of general uneasiness and want of spirit. It was now that the Athenian general convinced them, that he was capable of fulfilling all the promises of the oracle; he encouraged them by his poems, directed them by his counsels, and recruited their broken armies with chosen men from among the Helotes. Aristomenes, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, acted with no less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> and vigour. He thought it not enough to restore the reputation of the Messenians, if he did not also restore their wealth and power: he therefore taught them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> offensively against their enemies; and, entering the territories of Sparta, he took and plundered Pha\u00ebte, a considerable borough in Laconia, putting all such as made any resistance to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>, carrying off at the same time an immense booty. This, however, was an injury which the Spartans could not brook with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a>; they therefore sent immediately a body of forces to overtake the Messenians, which accordingly they did: but Aristomenes routed these pursuers, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to make a mighty slaughter of them, till such time as he was disabled by having a spear thrust in his side, which occasioned his being carried out of the battle. His cure, which took up some time, being finished, he resolved to carry the war even to the gates of Sparta; and to that purpose raised a very great army: but, whether he found his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> impracticable, or was really diverted by some dream, he gave out, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASTOR\">Castor</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLLUX\">Pollux</a>, with their sister Helena, had appeared to him, and commanded him to desist. A short time after this retreat, going with a small party to make an incursion, and attempting to take prisoners some women who were celebrating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RITES\">rites</a> near Egila, a village in Laconia, those zealous matrons fell upon him and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> with such fury, that they put them to flight, and took him prisoner: however, he soon afterwards made his escape, and rejoined his forces. In the third year of the war, the Spartans with a great force entered Messenia, whither Arifocrates king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCADIA\">Arcadia</a> was come, with a great body of troops, to the assistance of his allies: Aristomenes therefore made no difficulty of fighting when the Spartans approached; but they entering privately into a negociation with Arifocrates, engaged him with bribes and promises to betray his confederates. When the battle began, the deceitful Arcadian represented to the forces under his command the mighty danger they were in, and the great difficulty there would be of retreating into their own country, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> the battle should be lost: he then pretended, that the sacrifices were ominous; and, having terrified his Arcadians into the disposition of mind fitted to serve his purpose, he not only drew them off from both wings, but, in his flight, forced through the Messenian ranks, and put them too in confusion. Aristomenes and his troops, however, drew themselves into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> order, that they might defend themselves the best they could: and Messenia indeed they had need of all their valour and skill; for the Lacedemonians, who expected this event, immediately attacked and surrounded them on all sides. Fortune was, on this occasion, too powerful either for the courage or the conduct of the Messenians; so that, notwithstanding their utmost efforts, most of their army were cut to pieces, and amongst them the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>. Aristomenes, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> remains of his shattered forces, retired as well as he could; and, perceiving that it was now impossible to maintain the war against the Lacedemonians upon equal terms, he exhorted his countrymen to fortify Mount Era, and to make the best dispositions possible for a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>. He likewise placed garrisons in Pylus and Methone on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> coasts; and to these three places he gathered all the inhabitants, leaving the rest of Messenia to the mercy of the Spartans. They, on the other hand, looked on the war as now in a manner finished; for which reason they divided the lands among their citizens, and caused them to be carefully cultivated, while they besieged Era. But Arifomenes quickly convinced them that the war was far from being over: he chose out of all the Messenians 300 men, with whom he ravaged all the adjacent country: carried off a prodigious booty; and, when Messenia could no longer supply the wants of his garrison, penetrated into Laconia, and bore away corn, wine, cattle, and whatever else was necessary to the subsistence of his countrymen shut up in Era: so that at last the Spartans were constrained to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCLAMATION\">proclamation</a>, forbidding the cultivation, not only of the Messenian territory in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, but also of Laconia in its vicinity; whereby they distressed themselves more than their enemies, inducing at last a famine in Sparta itself, which brought with it its usual attendant, sedition. Here again all things had gone wrong, if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> of the poet Tyrt\u00e6us had not supported the Spartan courage; nor was it without much difficulty that he influenced them to continue the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCKADE\">blockade</a> of Era, and to maintain a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a> for the security of the country.\n\nAristomenes, in spite of all these precautions, committed terrible depredations with his small corps of 300 men. Amongst other places which he plundered, the city of Amycl\u00e6 was one; from whence he carried not only a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a>, but also many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LADEN\">laden</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>. The kings of Sparta lying with their troops in its neighbourhood, as soon as they heard of this expedition, marched after Aristomenes with the utmost diligence; and, as the Messenians were encumbered with their booty, came up with them before they could reach Era. In this situation of things, Aristomenes, prompted rather by despair than prudence, disposed his troops in order of battle; and, notwithstanding they were so few, made a long and vigorous resistance against the whole Lacedemonian army. At length, however, numbers prevailed: the greatest part of the Messenians were slain on the spot; and Aristomenes, with about 50 of his men who survived the slaughter, were taken prisoners; that chief having received so many wounds, that he was senseless when they carried him away. The Lacedemonians expressed the loudest joy at the sight of this illustrious captive; who for so many years, by his single abilities, had\nMes\n\nMessenia had enabled his exhausted country to defend itself against the whole force of Sparta. When he was recovered from his wounds, they decreed him and all his fellow prisoners to be thrown together into a deep cavern, which was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> of the lowest kind of offenders. This judgement was executed with the utmost severity, excepting that Ariftomenes had leave to put on his armour. Three days he continued in this dismal place, lying upon and covered over with dead bodies. The third day, he was almost famished through want of food, and almost poisoned with the stench of corrupted carcases, when he heard a fox gnawing a body near him. Upon this he uncovered his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, and perceiving the fox <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> by him, he with one hand seized one of its hind legs, and with the other defended his face, by catching hold of its jaw when it attempted to bite him. Following as well as he could his struggling guide, the fox at last thrust his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> into a little hole; and Ariftomenes then letting go his leg, he soon forced his way through, and opened a passage to the welcome rays of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, from which the noble Messenian had been so long debarred.\n\nFeeble as he was, Ariftomenes wrought himself an outlet with his nails; and travelling by night with all the expedition he could, at length arrived safe at Era, to the great joy and amazement of his countrymen. When this news was first blazed abroad, the Spartans would have had it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> for a fiction; but Ariftomenes soon put the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of it out of doubt, by falling on the pots of the Corinthians, who, as allies of the Spartans, had a considerable body of troops before Era.\n\nMost of their officers, with a multitude of private men, he slew; pillaged their camp; and, in short, did so much mischief, that the Spartans, under the pretence of an approaching festival, agreed to a cessation of arms for 40 days, that they might have time to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> their dead. On this occasion, Ariftomenes for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> time celebrated the hetaeromphonia, or the sacrifice appointed for those who had killed 100 of the enemy with their own hands. He had performed the same before and after his second battle; and he lived to do it a third time: which must appear wonderful to the reader, when he is informed, that notwithstanding this truce, certain Cretan archers in the service of the Spartans seized Ariftomenes as he was walking without the walls, and carried him away a prisoner. There were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> of them in all; two of them immediately flew with the news to Sparta, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> remained to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a>, whom they bound, and conducted to a lone cottage inhabited only by a widow and her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a>. It fell out, that the young woman dreamed the night before, that she <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> a lion without claws, bound, and dragged along by wolves; and that she having loosed his bonds, and given him claws, he immediately tore the wolves to pieces. As soon as Ariftomenes came into the cottage, and her mother, who knew him, had told her who he was, she instantly concluded that her dream was fulfilled; and therefore plied the Cretans with drink, and, when they were asleep, took a poniard from one of them, cut the thongs with which Ariftomenes was bound, and then put it into his hands. He presently verified her vision, by putting all his guards to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>; and then carried her and her mother to Era, where, as a reward for her service, he married the young woman to his son Gorgus, then about 18 years of age.\n\nWhen Era had held out near eleven years, it fell into the hands of Sparta by an accident: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> of one Empiramus, a Spartan commander, driving his master's cattle to drink at the river Neda, met frequently with the wife of a Messenian, whom he engaged in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMOUR\">amour</a>. This woman gave him notice, that her husband's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> was without the wall; so that he could come to it without danger, when the good man was abroad; and she likewise gave him intelligence when her husband was upon duty in the garrison. The Spartan failed not to come at the time appointed; but they had not been long in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> before the husband returned, which put the house into great confusion: the woman, however, secured her gallant; and then let in her husband, whom she received in appearance with great joy, inquiring again and again by what excess of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a> she was blest with his return. The innocent Messenian told her, that Ariftomenes being detained in his bed by a wound, the soldiers knowing that he could not walk the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROUNDS\">rounds</a>, had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> to retire to their houses, to avoid the inclemency of the season. The Spartan no sooner heard this, than he crept softly out of doors, and hastened away to carry the news to his master. It happened, that the kings were at this time absent from the camp, and Empiramus had the chief command of the army. As soon as he received this information, he ordered his army to begin its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">march</a>, though it rained excessively, and there was no moonlight. The fellow guided them to the ford, and managed matters so well that they seized all the Messenian pots: yet, after all, they were afraid to engage; darkness, and high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, heavy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>, together with the dread of Ariftomenes, keeping them quiet in the places they had seized. As soon as it was light, the attack began; and Era had been quickly taken, if only the men had defended it; but the women fought with such fury, and by their mingling in the fray, brought such an accession of numbers, as made the event doubtful. Three days and two nights this desperate engagement lasted: at last, all hopes of preserving the city being lost, Ariftomenes drew off his wearied troops. Early in the fourth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, he disposed the women and children in the centre, the Messenian youth in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> and rear, the least able men in the main body: himself commanded the van; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REAR_GUARD\">rear-guard</a> was brought up by Gorgus and Manticlus, the former the son of Ariftomenes, the latter of Theocles, a Messenian of great merit, who fell with much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> in this attack, fighting valiantly in the cause of his country. When all things were ready, Ariftomenes caused the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARRIER\">barrier</a> to be thrown open; and, brandishing his spear, marched directly towards the Spartan troops, in order to force a passage. Empiramus, perceiving his intent, ordered his men to open to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> and left, and fairly gave them a passage; so that Ariftomenes marched off in triumph, as it were, to Arcadia.\n\nThe Arcadians, when they heard that Era was taken, were very desirous of succouring their old confederates in this deep distress: they therefore treated their king Ariftocrates to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> them into Messenia.\nBut he, corrupted by the Lacedemonians, persuaded them that it was too late; that the Messenians were all cut off; and that such a step would only expose them to the fury of the conquerors. When the thing appeared to be otherwise, and it was known that Arictomenes was on the frontiers of Arcadia, they went in crowds to carry him provisions, and to testify their readiness to assist him and those under his command all the affluence in their power. Arictomenes desired to be heard before a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a>; which being accordingly convoked, he there opened one of the boldest and best laid schemes recorded in history: he said, that he had yet 500 undaunted soldiers, who, at his command, would undertake anything; that it was very probable most of the Spartans were employed in pillaging Eria, and that therefore he determined to march and surprise Sparta; which appeared so sensible, that all the assembly loudly commended his great capacity and unshaken courage. Arictocrates, however, took care to betray him; having, by various pretences, retarded the execution of the project. The Arcadians, who began to suspect him, waited for and surprized the messengers as they came back. They took the letters from them, and read them openly in the assembly. The purport of them was, that they acknowledged his great kindness both now and in the battle; and promised, that the Lacedemonians would be grateful. As soon as the letters were read, the Arcadians fell to stoning their king, frequently calling upon the Messenians to assist them; which, however, they did not, waiting for Arictomenes's orders; who, far from triumphing in this spectacle, stood still, with his eyes fixed on the ground, which he wet with his tears, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> pierced with sorrow to see a crowned head so shamefully and so deservedly put to death. The Arcadians afterwards erected a monument over him, with an inscription to perpetuate his infamy. As for the Messenians under the command of Gorgus and Manticlus, they passed over into Sicily; where they founded the city of Messene, one of the most famous in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>. Arictomenes remained, however, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>; where he married all his daughters, except the youngest, to persons of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RHODES\">Rhodes</a>, inquiring of the oracle at Delphi whom he should espouse, that his subjects might be happy under his prosperity, was directed to marry the daughter of the most worthy of the Greeks; which answer was immediately understood to point at the virgin daughter of Arictomenes. Her therefore he demanded, and received; Arictomenes accompanying him back to his dominions, where he formed a scheme of uniting the Lydians and Medes against the Spartans, resolving with this view to go into Media, and to the court of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SARDIS\">Sardis</a>; but while he meditated these great things, death surprized him, and thereby freed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LACEDEMON\">Lacedemon</a> from the most formidable enemy she ever had.","sp":148,"ep":152},{"h":"MESSIAH","t":"a word signifying one anointed, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> installed into an office by unction. It was usual among the Jews to anoint kings, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> priests, and sometimes prophets, at the consecration or installment of them, to signify emblematically the mental qualifications necessary for discharging these offices. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAUL\">Saul</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAVID\">David</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLOMON\">Solomon</a>, and Joab, kings of Judah, received the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> unction. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AARON\">Aaron</a> and his sons received the sacerdotal, and Elisha the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> of Elijah received the prophetic unction.\u2014The name MESSIAH, Anointed or Christ (\u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2), was given to the kings and high-priests of the Jews. The patriarchs and prophets are also called by the name of Messiah, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>'s anointed. See 1 Sam. xii. 3, 5; 1 Chron. xvi. 22; Ps. cv. 15.\n\nBut this name Messiah was principally and by way of eminence given by the Jews to their expected great Deliverer, whose coming they still vainly wait; and is a name the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> apply to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> Christ, in whom the prophecies relating to the Messiah were accomplished. The sum of these prophecies is, That there should be a glorious person named Messiah, descended from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABRAHAM\">Abraham</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JACOB\">Jacob</a>, who should be born at Bethlehem, of a virgin of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of David, then in its decline, before the Jews ceased to be a people, while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> temple was standing, and about 500 years after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EZRA\">Ezra</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>; who, though appearing in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> circumstances, should be introduced by a remarkable forerunner, whose business it should be to awaken the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of the people. That this illustrious person called Messiah should himself be eminent for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a> of his character, and the miraculous works he should perform: yet that, notwithstanding all this, he should be rejected and put to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> by the Jews; but should afterwards be raised from the dead, and exalted to a glorious throne, on which he should through all generations continue to rule, at the same time making intercession for sinners. That great calamities should for the present be brought on the Jews for rejecting him: whereas the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of God should by his means be erected among the Gentiles, and disperse itself even unto the ends of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>; wherever it came, destroying idolatry, and establishing true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> and righteousness. In a word, That this glorious person should be regarded by all who believed in him as a divine teacher, an atoning sacrifice, and a royal governor: by means of whom God would make a covenant with his people, very different from that made with Israel of old; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of which they should be restored to, and established in, the divine favour, and fixed in a state of perpetual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>. See Jesus Christ, and Christianity.\n\nThe Jews, as was already observed, still wait for the coming of the Messiah, being impressed with the notion of a temporal Messiah, who is to be a mighty conqueror, and to subdue all the world. Most of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> rabbins, according to Buxtorf, believe that the Messiah is already come, but that he keeps himself concealed, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not manifest himself because of the sins of the Jews. Some of the Jews, however, in order to reconcile these prophecies that seem to contradict each other as to the character and condition of the Messiah, have had recourse to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> of two Messiahs, who are yet to succeed each other; one in a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMILIATION\">humiliation</a> and suffering; the other of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, splendor, and power. The first, they say, is to proceed from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> of Ephraim, who is to fight against Gog, and to be slain by Amnillus, Zech. xii. 10. The second is to be of the tribe of Judah, and\nand lineage of David, who is to conquer and kill An-\nnillus, and restore the kingdom of Israel, reigning over\nit in the highest glory and felicity.\n\nJesus Christ affirms himself the Messiah. In St\nJohn iv. 25, the Samaritan woman says to Jesus, I\nknow that when Messiah comes, who is called the Christ,\nhe will tell us all things. Jesus answered her, I that\nspeak to thee am he.\n\nThere are several impostors, who have endeavoured\nto <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> for Messiahs, as Christ himself predicted.

A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a> resembles a lion, and upon that resemblance many similes have been raised by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a> and other poets.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> here, that of resemblance, belongs to the thought. An additional pleasure arises from the expression: the poet, by figuring his hero to be a lion, goes on to describe the lion in appearance, but in reality the hero; and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> is peculiarly beautiful, by expressing the virtues and qualities of the hero in new terms, which, properly speaking, belong not to him, but to the lion. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> better be understood by examples.

A metaphor is defined above to be an act of the imagination, figuring one thing to be another. An allegory requires no such operation, nor is one thing figured to be another: it confuses in choosing a subject having properties or circumstances resembling those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> subject: and the former is described in such a manner as to represent the latter: the subject thus represented is kept out of view: we are left to discover it by reflection; and we are pleased with the discovery, because it is our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>. (See the word ALLEGORY.)\n\nQuintilian gives the following instance of an allegory.\n\nO navis, referent in mare te <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVI\">novi</a>\nFluctus. O quid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGIS\">agis</a>? fortiter occupa portum.\n\nHorat. Lib. i. ode 14.\n\nand explains it elegantly in the following words: \"Totaque ille Horatii locus, quo navim pro republica, fluctuum tempestatibus pro bellis civilibus, portum pro pace atque <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCORDIA\">concordia</a>,\" dicit.\n\nIn a figure of speech, there is no fiction of the imagination employed, as in a metaphor; nor a representative subject introduced, as in an allegory. This figure, as its name implies, regards the expression only, not the thought; and it may be defined, the using a word in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> different from what is proper to it.\n\nThus youth, or the beginning of life, is expressed figuratively by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> of life: morning is the beginning of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>; and in that view it is employed to signify the beginning of any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a>, life especially, the progress of which is reckoned by days. See Figure of Speech.\n\nMetaphor and allegory are so much connected, that it seemed proper to handle them together: the rules particularly for distinguishing the good from the bad, are common to both. We shall therefore proceed to these rules, after adding some examples to illustrate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of an allegory, which, with a view to this article, was but slightly illustrated under its proper name.\n\nHorace, speaking of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> to Pyrrha, which was now extinguished, expressed himself thus:\n\nMe tabula facer\nVotivae paries indicat uvida\nSuspendisse potenti\nVellimenta maris Deo.\n\nCarm. lib. i. ode 5.\n\nAgain:\nPhocbus volentem praelia me loqui,\nViolas et urbes, increpuit, lyra\nNe parva Tyrrhenum per aquor\nVela darem.\n\nCarm. lib. iv. ode 15.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a>.

Ha! thou hast rous'd\nThe lion in his den; he stalks abroad,\nAnd the wide forest trembles at his roar.\nI find the danger now.\n\nOroonoko, act iii. sc. 2:\n\n\"My well beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill. He fenced it, gathered out the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> thereof, planted it with the choicest vine, built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a wine press therein; he looked that it should bring forth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAPES\">grapes</a>, and it brought forth wild grapes. And now, O inhabitants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard. What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done? Wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes? And now go to, I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down. And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged, but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a> that they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> no rain upon it. For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant.\"\n\nIsaiah v. 1.\n\nThe rules that govern metaphors and allegories are of two kinds. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of these figures comes under the first kind: the propriety or impropriety of introduction comes under the other.\u2014To begin with rules of the first kind; some of which coincide with those already given for similes; some are peculiar to metaphors and allegories.\n\nIn the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, it has been observed, that a simile cannot be agreeable where the resemblance is either too strong or too faint. This holds equally in metaphor and allegory; and the reason is the same in all.\n\nIn the following instances, the resemblance is too faint to be agreeable.\n\nMalcolm. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 But there's no bottom, none,\nIn my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,\nYour matrons, and your maids, could not fill up\nThe cistern of my lust.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACBETH\">Macbeth</a>, act iv. sc. 4.\n\nThe best way to judge of this metaphor, is to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> it into a simile: which would be bad, because there is scarce any resemblance between lust and a cistern, or betwixt enormous lust and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> cistern.\n\nAgain:\n\nHe cannot buckle his distemper'd cause\nWithin the belt of rule.\n\nMacbeth, act v. sc. 2.\n\nThere is no resemblance between a distempered cause and any body that can be confined within a belt.\n\nAgain:\n\nSteep me in poverty to the very lips.\n\nOthello, act iv. sc. 9.\n\nPoverty\nMetaphor Poverty here must be conceived a fluid, which it resembles not in any manner.\n\nSpeaking to Bolingbroke banish'd for six years:\n\nThe sullen passage of thy weary steps,\nEsteem a foil, wherein thou art to set\nThe precious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEWEL\">jewel</a> of thy home-return.\n\nRichard II. act ii. sc. 6.\n\nAgain:\n\nHere is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a>,\nAnd every word in it a gaping wound\nIssuing life-blood.\n\nMerchant of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a>, act iii. sc. 3.\n\nTante molis erat Romanam condere gentem.\n\n\u00c6neid. i. 37.\n\nThe following metaphor is strained beyond all endurance: Timur-bec, known to us by the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAMERLANE\">Tamerlane</a> the Great, writes to Bojazet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> of the Ottomans in the following terms:\n\n\"Where is the monarch who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DARES\">dares</a> resist us? where is the potentate who doth not glory in being numbered among our attendants? As for thee, descended from a Turcoman sailor, since the vessel of thy unbounded ambition hath been wreck'd in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a> of thy self-love, it would be proper, that thou shouldest take in the fails of thy temerity, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> the anchor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPENTANCE\">repentance</a> in the port of sincerity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, which is the port of safety; lest the tempest of our vengeance make thee perish in the sea of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> thou deservest.\"\n\nSuch strained figures, as observed above, are not unfrequent in the first dawn of refinement; the mind in a new enjoyment knows no bounds, and is generally carried to excess, till <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> discover the proper limits.\n\nSecondly, Whatever resemblance subjects may have, it is wrong to put one for another, where they bear no mutual proportion. Upon comparing a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> to a very low subject, the simile takes on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURLESQUE\">burlesque</a>; and the same will be the effect where the one is imagined to be the other, as in a metaphor; or made to represent the other, as in an allegory.\n\nThirdly, These figures, a metaphor especially, ought not to be crowded with many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> circumstances; for in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> it is scarcely possible to avoid obscurity. A metaphor above all ought to be short: it is difficult, for any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, to support a lively image of a thing being what we know it is not; and for that reason, a metaphor drawn out to any length, instead of illusrating or enlivening the principal subject, becomes disagreeable by overtraining the mind. Here Cowley is extremely licentious. Take the following instance.\n\nGreat and wise conqueror, who where'er\nThou com'st, dost fortify, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> there!\nWho canst defend as well as get;\nAnd never hadst one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> up yet;\nNow thou art in, thou ne'er wilt part\nWith one inch of my vanquished heart;\nFor since thou took'st it by assault from me\n'Tis garrison's so strong with thoughts of thee,\nIt fears no beauteous enemy.\n\nFor the same reason, however agreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> allegories may at first be by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a>, they never afford any lasting pleasure: witness the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAIRY\">Fairy</a> Queen, which with great power of expression, variety of images, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MELODY\">melody</a> of versification, is scarce ever read a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> time.\n\nIn the fourth place, The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> carried on in a simile, being in a metaphor sunk by imagining the principal subject to be that very thing which it only resembles; an opportunity is furnished to describe it in terms taken strictly or literally with respect to its imagined nature. This suggests another rule, That in constructing a metaphor, the writer ought to make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of such words only as are applicable literally to the imagined nature of his subject: figurative words ought carefully to be avoided; for such complicated figures, instead of setting the principal subject in a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, involve it in a cloud, and it is well <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the reader, without rejecting by the lump, endeavour patiently to gather the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> meaning, regardless of the figures:\n\nA stubborn and unconquerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a>\nCreeps in his veins, and drinks the streams of life.\n\nLady Jane Gray, act i. sc. i.\n\nCopied from Ovid:\n\nSorbent avid\u00e6 praecordia flamm\u00e6.\n\nMetamorph. lib. ix. 172.\n\nLet us analyze this expression. That a fever may be imagined a flame, we admit: though more than one step is necessary to come at the resemblance: a fever, by heating the body, resembles fire; and it is no stretch to imagine a fever to be a fire: again, by a figure of speech, flame may be put for fire, because they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> conjoined; and therefore a fever may be termed a flame. But now admitting a fever to be a flame, its effects ought to be explained in words that agree literally to a flame. This rule is not observed here; for a flame drinks figuratively only, not properly.\n\nKing Henry to his son <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> Henry:\n\nThou hid'st a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,\nWhich thou hast whetted on thy stony heart\nTo stab at half an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> of my frail life.\n\nSecond Part Henry IV. act iv. sc. ii.\n\nSuch faulty metaphors are pleasantly ridiculed in the Rehearsal:\n\n\"Physician. Sir, to conclude, the place you fill has more than amply exacted the talents of a wary pilot; and all these threatening storms, which, like impregnate clouds, hover o'er our heads, will, when they once are grasped but by the eye of reason, melt into fruitful showers of blessings on the people.\"\n\n\"Bayer. Pray mark that allegory. Is not that good.\"\n\n\"Johnson. Yes, that grasping of a storm with the eye is admirable.\"\n\nAct ii. sc. i.\n\nFifthly, The jumbling different metaphors in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a>, beginning with one metaphor and ending with another, commonly called a mix metaphor, ought never to be indulged.\n\nK. Henry.\nK. Henry. \u2014\u2014Will you again unknit\nThis churlish knot of all-abhorred war,\nAnd move in that obedient orb again,\nWhere you did give a fair and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> light?\nFirst Part Henry VI. act v. sc. 1.\n\nWhether 'tis nobler in the mind, to suffer\nThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune;\nOr to take arms against a sea of troubles,\nAnd by opposing end them.\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAMLET\">Hamlet</a>, act iii. sc. 2.\n\nIn the sixth place, It is unpleasent to join different metaphors in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, even where they are preserved distinct: for when the subject is imagined to be first one thing and then another in the same period without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>, the mind is diffracted by the rapid transition; and when the imagination is put on such hard duty, its images are too faint to produce any good effect:\n\nAt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol0.html#article-REGINA\">regina</a> gravi jamdudum faucia cura,\nVulnus alti venis, et caeco carpitur igni.\n\u00c6neid. iv. 1.\n\nEst mollis flamma medullas\nInterea, et tacitum vivit sub pechore vulnus.\n\u00c6neid. iv. 66.\n\nMotum ex Metello consule civicum,\nBellique causas, et vitia, et modos,\nLudumque fortun\u00e6, graveque\nPrincipum aniciti\u00e6, et arma\nNondum expiatis uncta cruribus,\nPericulose plenum opus ale\u00e6,\nTractas, et incendis per ignes\nSubpositos cineri dolof\u00e6.\nHorat. Carm. lib. ii. ode 1.\n\nIn the last place, It is still worse to jumble together metaphorical and natural expression, so as that the period must be understood in part metaphorically, in part literally; for the imagination cannot follow with sufficient ease changes so sudden and unprepared: a metaphor begun and not carried on, hath no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>; and instead of light, there is nothing but obscurity and confusion. Instances of such incorrect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> are without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>: we shall, for a specimen, select a few from different authors. Speaking of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>,\n\nThis precious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> set in the sea,\nWhich serves it in the office of a wall,\nOr as a most defensive to a house,\nAgainst the envy of less happier lands.\nRichard II. act ii. sc. 1.\n\nIn the first line Britain is figured to be a precious stone: in the following line, Britain, divested of her metaphorical dress, is presented to the reader in her natural appearance.\n\nThese growing feathers pluck'd from C\u00e6sar's wing,\nWill make him fly an ordinary pitch,\nWho else would soar above the view of men,\nAnd keep us all in fervile fearfulness.\nJulius C\u00e6sar, act i. sc. 1.\n\nRebus angustis animosus atque\nFortis adpare: sapienter idem\nContrahas vento nimum secundo\nTurgida vela.\nHor. Carm. lib. ii. ode 10.\n\nThe following is a miserable jumble of expressions, arising from an unsteady view of the subject, between its figurative and natural appearance:\n\nBut now from gathering clouds destruction pours,\nWhich ruins with mad rage our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALCYON\">halcyon</a> hours:\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLS\">Mills</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> jealousies the tempest form,\nWhilst late divisions reinforce the storm.\nDijonfary, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTO\">canto</a> iii.\n\nTo thee the world its present homage pays,\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a> early, but mature the praise.\nPope's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">Imitation</a> of Horace, book ii.\n\nOui, sa pudeur ne s'est que franche grimace,\nQu'une <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OMBRE\">ombre</a> de vertu qui garde mal la place,\nEt qui s'\u00e9vanouit, comme l'on peut favorir,\nAux rayons du soleil qu'une bourre vait voir.\nMoli\u00e8re, L'\u00c9tourdi, act iii. sc. 2.\n\nEt son feu, de pourv\u00fb de fente et de lecture,\nS'\u00e9teint \u00e0 chaque pas, faut de nourriture.\nBoileau, L'Art Po\u00e9tique, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANT\">chant</a>. iii. l. 319.\n\nDryden, in his dedication of the translation of \u00c6neid, says, \"When thus, as I may say, before the use of the loadstone, or knowledge of the compass, I was sailing in a vast ocean, without other help than the pole-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">star</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, and the rules of the French stage among the moderns,\" &c.\n\n\"There is a time when factions, by the vehemence of their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENTATION\">fermentation</a>, stun and disable one another.\"\nBolingbroke.\n\nThis fault of jumbling the figure and plain expression into one confused <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>, is not less common in allegory than in metaphor.\n\nTake the following examples:\n\nHeu! quoties fidelis,\nMutatoque Deos flebit, et alpera\nNigris aquora ventis\nEmirabitur infolens,\nQui nunc te fruatur credulus aurea;\nQui semper vacuam, semper amabilem\nSperat, nec sius aur\u00e6\nFallacis.\nHorat. Carm. lib. i. ode 5.\n\nPour moi sur <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CETTE\">cette</a> mer, qu'ici bas nous courons,\nJe songe \u00e0 me pourvoir d'\u00e9quipet et d'avirons,\n\u00c0 r\u00e9gler mes desirs, \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir l'orage,\nEt sauver, s'il se peut, ma Raison du naufrage.\nBoileau, epitre 5.\n\nLord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALIFAX\">Halifax</a>, speaking of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> fabulists: \"They (says he) wrote in signs, and spoke in parables: all their fables carry a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> meaning: the story is one, and entire; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> the same throughout; not broken or changed, and always conformable to the nature of the creature they introduce. They never tell you, that the dog which snapped at a shadow, lost his troop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>; that would be unintelligible. This is\nMetaphor. His (Dryden's new way of telling a story, and confounding the moral and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a> together.) After insisting from the Hind and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PANTHER\">Panther</a>, he goes on thus:\n\n\"What relation has the hind to our Saviour? or what notion have we of a panther's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIBLE\">bible</a>? If you say he means the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, how does the church feed on lawns, or range in the forest? Let it be always a church, or always a cloven-footed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAST\">beast</a>; for we cannot bear his shifting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> every line.\"\n\nA few words more upon allegory. Nothing gives greater pleasure than this figure, when the representative subject bears a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a>, in all its circumstances, to that which is represented: but the choice is seldom so lucky; the analogy being generally too faint and obscure, as to puzzle and not please. An allegory is still more difficult in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> than in poetry; the former can show no resemblance but what appears to the eye; the latter hath many other resources for showing the resemblance. And therefore, with respect to what the abbe du <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOS\">Bos</a> terms mixt allegorical compositions, these may do in poetry; because, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, the allegory can easily be distinguished from the historical part: no person, for example, mistakes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">Fame</a> for a real being. But such a mixture in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> is intolerable; because in a picture the objects must appear all of the same kind, wholly real or wholly emblematical. For this reason, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a> de Medicis, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> of Luxembourg, painted by Rubens, is unpleasing by a perpetual jumble of real and allegorical personages, which produce a discordance of parts, and an obscurity upon the whole: witness, in particular, the tablature representing the arrival of Mary de Medicis at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARSEILLES\">Marseilles</a>; where, together with the real personages, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEREIDS\">Nereids</a> and Tritons appear founding their shells: such a mixture of fiction and reality in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUP\">group</a> is strangely absurd. The picture of Alexander and Roxana, described by Lucian, is gay and fanciful; but it suffers by the allegorical figures. It is not in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> of man to invent an allegorical representation deviating farther from any shadow of resemblance, than one exhibited by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XIV. anno 1664; in which an enormous chariot, intended to represent that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, is dragged along, surrounded with men and women, representing the four ages of the world, the celestial signs, the seasons, the hours, &c. a monstrous composition, and yet scarcely more absurd than Guido's tablature of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AURORA\">Aurora</a>.\n\nIn an allegory, as well as in a metaphor, terms ought to be chosen that properly and literally, are applicable to the representative subject; nor ought any circumstance to be added that is not proper to the representative subject, however justly it may be applicable properly or figuratively to the principal. The following allegory is therefore faulty:\n\nFerus et Cupido,\nSemper ardentes acuens sagittas.\nCote cruenta.\nHorat. lib. ii, ode 8.\n\nFor though blood may suggest the cruelty of love, it is an improper or immaterial circumstance in the representative subject: water, not blood, is proper for a whetstone.\n\nWe proceed to the next head, which is, to examine in what circumstances these figures are proper, in what improper. This inquiry is not altogether superseded by what is said upon the same subject in the article Comparison; because, upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, it will be found, that a short metaphor or allegory may be proper, where a simile, drawn out to a greater length, and in its nature more solemn, would scarcely be relished.\n\nAnd, in the first place, A metaphor, like a simile, is excluded from common conversation, and from the description of ordinary incidents. Secondly, In expressing any severe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> that totally occupies the mind, metaphor is unnatural.\n\nThe following example, of deep despair, beside the highly figurative style, has more the air of raving than of sense:\n\nCalifa. Is it the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a>, or my father?\nMadness! confusion! let the storm come on,\nLet the tumultuous roar drive all upon me,\nDahr my devoted bark; ye surges, break it;\n'Tis for my ruin that the tempest rises.\nWhen I am lost, sunk to the bottom low,\nPeace shall return, and all be calm again.\n\nFair Penitent, act v.\n\nThe following metaphor is sweet and lively; but it suits not the fiery temper of Chamont, inflamed with passion: parables are not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of wrath venting itself without restraint:\n\nChamont. You took her up a little tender flow'r,\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">Just</a> sprouted on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a>, which the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FROST\">frost</a>\nHad nipp'd; and with a careful loving hand,\nTransplanted her into your own fair garden,\nWhere the sun always shines: there long she flourish'd,\nGrew sweet to sense, and lovely to the eye;\nTill at the last a cruel spoiler came,\nCropt this fair rose, and riled all its sweetness,\nThen cast it like a loathsome weed away.\n\nOrphan, act iv.\n\nThe following speech, full of imagery, is not natural in grief and dejection of mind.\n\nGonfalone. O my son! from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> dotage\nOf a father's fondness these ills arose,\nFor thee I've been ambitious, base, and bloody:\nFor thee I've plung'd into this sea of sin;\nStemming the tide with only one weak hand,\nWhile o'ther bore the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> (to wreath thy brow),\nWhose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> has sunk me ere I reach'd the shore.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOURNING\">Mourning</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDE\">Bride</a>, act v. sc. 6.\n\nThere is an enchanting picture of deep distress in Macbeth, where Macduff is represented lamenting his wife and children, inhumanly murdered by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a>. Stung to the heart with the news, he questions the messenger over and over: not that he doubted the fact, but that his heart revolted against so cruel a misfortune. After struggling some time with his grief, he turns from his wife and children to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTCHER\">butcher</a>: and then gives vent to his resentment, but still with manliness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>:\n\nO, I could play the woman with mine eyes,\nAnd braggart with my tongue. But, gentle Heav'n!\nCut short all intermission; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> to front\nBring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;\nWithin,\nMetaphorical expression, indeed, may sometimes be used with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> where a regular simile would be intolerable; but there are situations so severe and dispiriting, as not to admit even the slightest metaphor. It requires great delicacy of taste to determine with firmness, whether the present case be of that nature: perhaps it is; yet who could with a single word of this admirable scene altered?\n\nBut metaphorical language is proper when a man struggles to bear with dignity or decency a misfortune however great; the struggle agitates and animates the mind:\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">METAPHYSICS</a>.**\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-DEFINITION\">Definition</a>. **Metaphysics** has been defined, by a writer deeply read in the ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, \"The science of the principles and causes of all things existing.\" This definition, we think, extremely proper; and hence it is, that mind or intelligence, and especially the supreme intelligence, which is the cause of the universe, and of every thing which it contains, is the principal subject of this science; and hence, too, the science itself received its name. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>, indeed, who, of all the ancient metaphysicians whose works have come down to us, was unquestionably the greatest, calls this science **the first philosophy**, as being not only superior, but also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> in the order of nature, to the whole circle of the other arts and sciences. But, \"what is first to nature, is not first to man.\" Nature begins with causes, which produce effects. Man begins with effects, and by them ascends to causes. Thus all human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> proceed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> in the reverse of the natural order of things, from sensible to intelligible, from body the effect, to mind, which is both the first and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> cause. Now, **physics** being the name given by the Stagyrite to the philosophy of body, some of his interpreters, from this necessary course of human studies, called that of mind **metaphysics**, implying by that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a>, not only that its subject is more sublime and difficult, but also that the study of it would be most properly and successfully entered upon after that of physics. To this name, which, though it has sometimes been treated with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a>, is abundantly significant, the followers of Aristotle were led by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, who, to the books in which he pretends to elevate the mind above things corporeal to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> of God and things spiritual, prefixed the Greek words \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1 (A).\n\nThe science of Metaphysics has been divided, according to the objects which it considers, into six principal parts, which are called, 1. Ontology; 2. Cosmology; 3. Anthroposophy; 4. Psychology; 5. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PNEUMATICS\">Pneumatics</a>; and, 6. Metaphysical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a>.\n\n1. That part of the science which is named ontology; logy, investigates and explains the nature and essence of all beings, as well as the qualities and attributes that essentially appertain to them. Hence it has been said that ontology should proceed in its operations from the most simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>; such as do not admit of any other qualities of which they may be compounded. These simple ideas are of being, of essence, of substance, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a>, of existence as well with regard to time as place, of a necessary cause of unity; the idea of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATION\">negation</a>; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between a being that is simple or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a>, necessary or accidental, finite or infinite; the ideas of essential and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> properties, such as of the greatness, perfection, and goodness of beings, &c. The business therefore of ontology, is to make us acquainted with every kind of being in its nature and essential qualities, which distinguish it from all other beings. This knowledge being once established on simple principles, just consequences may thence be drawn, and those things proved after which the metaphysician inquires, and which is the business of his science to prove.\n\nIt is easy to conceive, that even a clear knowledge of beings, and their essential properties, would be still defective and useless to man, if he did not know how to determine and fix his ideas by proper denominations, and consequently to communicate his perceptions to those whom he would instruct, or against whom he is obliged to dilate. To render our ideas therefore intelligible to others, we must have determinate words or denominations for each being, and the qualities of each being; and ontology teaches us those terms which are so necessary to fix our ideas, and to give them the requisite perspicuity and precision, that when we endeavour to extend the sphere\n\n---\n\n(A) \u03a4\u039f\u039d \u039c\u0395\u03a4\u0391 \u03a4\u0391 \u03a6\u03a5\u03a3\u0399\u039a\u0391. Cuius inscriptionis haec ratio est, quod in hoc opere ca tradantur quorum theoria <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POSTERIOR\">posterior</a> est doctrinae naturali faltem quod nos, qui a corporum cognitione rerumque caducarum in substantiarum immaterialium atque immortalium contemplationem provehimus.\n\nDu Val. Synopsis Doctr. Peripat.\nDivisions of our knowledge, we may not waste our time in disputes about words.\n\n2. Metaphysics, having, in as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> a manner as Cosmology; possible, explained and established the principles above mentioned, continues its inquiries to the second part, which is called cosmology, and examines into the essence of the world and all that it contains; its eternal laws; of the nature of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>; of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>; of the nature of tangible bodies, their attributes and adjuncts; and of all that can be known by reasoning and experience. It is also in cosmology that the metaphysicians of this school examine the Leibnitzian system; that is, whether God, in creating the world, must necessarily have created the best world; and if this world be so in fact. In this manner they pursue the argument, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> to consequence, to its last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a>, frequently with very little advantage to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> and science.\n\n3. Anthroposophy, or the knowledge of man, forms the third branch of metaphysics. It is subdivided into two parts. The first, which consists in the knowledge of the exterior parts of the human frame, belongs not to this science, but to Anatomy and Physiology. The business of the metaphysician is here to ascertain the nature of those powers by which all the motions essential to life are produced; and to discover, if possible, whether they be corporeal or spiritual. This inquiry leads at the same time to Psychology;\n\n4. Psychology; which consists in the knowledge of the intellectual soul in particular; concerning which the most profound, the most subtle, and most abstract researches, have been made that human reason is capable of; and concerning the substance of which, in spite of all these efforts, it is yet extremely difficult to support any positive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> with conclusive or probable arguments.\n\n5. The fifth part of metaphysics is called pneumatology. By this term, which has not been long in use, metaphysicians <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> the knowledge of all spirits, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGELS\">angels</a>, &c. It is easy to conceive what infinite art is necessary to give an account of that, of which nothing positive can ever be known in the present state of human existence. But the metaphysician of this school readily offers to show us, \"what is the idea of a spirit; the effective existence of a spirit; what are its general qualities and properties; that there are rational spirits, and that these rational spirits have qualities that are founded in the moral attributes of God:\" for this is in so many words what is attempted to be taught in pneumatology.\n\n6. Metaphysical theology, which Leibnitz and some others call theodicy, is the sixth and last branch of the science of metaphysics. It teaches us the knowledge of the existence of God; to make the most rational suppositions concerning his divine essence, and to form a just idea of his attributes and perfections, and to demonstrate them by abstract reasoning. Theodicy differs from natural theology, in as much as this last borrows, in fact, from theodicy proofs and demonstrations to confirm the existence of a supreme Being: but after having solidly established that great truth, by extending its consequences natural theology teaches us what are the relations and connexions that subsist between the supreme Being and men, and what are the duties which result from these relations.\n\nWe have briefly mentioned these divisions of the science, because they were once prevalent in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a>. The greater part of them, however, appears to us to be not only superfluous, but such as can serve no other purpose than to perplex the mind. The only free useless beings of which we know anything are mind and body; and we have no reason to think that there are any other beings in the universe. Of bodies indeed there are various kinds, endowed with different properties: and it is extremely probable, that of minds endowed with different powers, the variety may be equally great. Our own minds we know to be united in one system with bodies by which they perform all their operations; and we can demonstrate that there is another Mind, which is independent of all body, and is the cause of all things. Between these there may be numberless orders of minds; but their energies are wholly unknown to us, and therefore they can never become the objects of science.\n\nMind and body therefore, i.e., the minds and bodies which we know to exist, together with their powers and properties, essential and accidental, can alone be the subjects of rational inquiry. We may inquire into the essence of mind and the essence of body, and endeavour to ascertain in what respects they differ. We may examine the nature of different bodies, in order to discover whether all bodies, however modified, have not something in common; and we may consider the properties, relations, and adjuncts of bodies, and endeavour to distinguish those which are accidental from such as appear to be necessary that without them body itself could not exist. Of minds we cannot make the same comparison. In this part of the science we have not sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATA\">data</a> for an accurate and complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDUCTION\">induction</a>; we can only examine the powers of our own mind; and by probable analogy make some estimate of the powers of superior minds, as observation will help us to guess at the powers of those which are placed beneath us in the scale of existence.\n\nIf this be so, Cosmology, as distinguished from Ontology, cannot properly be a branch of Metaphysics. For if mind and body, with their several powers, properties, and adjuncts, compose the universe, it is obvious, that when we have ascertained, as well as we are able, the essence of mind and the essence of body, together with the powers and properties of each, and have traced them all to the first cause, we have done every thing in the science of the universe, if we may use the expression, which belongs to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of the metaphysician. The particular laws of motion on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> and in the planetary system belong to the natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> and astronomer.\n\nIn like manner, Anthroposophy, Psychology, Pneumatology, if they be not words expressive of distinctions where there is no difference, seem to be at least very needlessly distinguished from each other. Of the nature of spirits we can know nothing but from contemplating the powers of our own minds; and the body of man is in the province, not of the metaphysician, but of the anatomist and physiologist. Anthroposophy, psychology, and pneumatology, if they be used to denote our knowledge of all minds except the Supreme, are words of the same import; for of no created minds except our own can we acquire such knowledge as deserves the name of science.\nOntology has sometimes been defined the science of the science being in the abstract; but in the course of our inquiries it will be seen, that being in the abstract is a phrase without meaning. Considered as the science of real beings and their properties, Ontology is a very significant word, of the same import with Metaphysics, comprehending in itself the knowledge of the nature of all things existing. Or if it be thought proper to make a distinction between ontology and theology, the former branch of the science will teach the knowledge of body and created minds, whilst it is the province of the latter to demonstrate the existence and attributes of that mind which is uncreated.\n\nBody and mind, therefore, with their properties, adjuncts, and powers, comprehend the whole subject of the science of metaphysics: and as we are earlier acquainted with body than with mind, the natural order of conducting our inquiries seems to be, to begin with the former, and thence proceed to the latter. It is obvious, however, that if we would pursue these inquiries with any hopes of success, we must first trace human knowledge from its source, ascertain the nature of truth, and show what kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> on each topic to be treated ought to enforce conviction. In this view of the science, metaphysics appears to be divided into three parts; the first treating of human understanding; the second, of body with its adjuncts; and the third, of mind with its powers.\n\nPrevious to the entering upon such inquiries, some philosophers of great merit have thought it expedient to explain the terms which they might have occasion to use. Their conduct is judicious and worthy of imitation; for the objects of metaphysics being, for the most part, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> not under the cognizance of the senses, are liable to be differently apprehended by different men, if the meanings of the words by which they are expressed be not ascertained with the utmost precision. We intend, however, to use very few words but in the common acceptation; and we therefore hope, that as terms of science are explained under different words in Divisions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DICTIONARY\">Dictionary</a>, to which references are made, we have the Science little or no occasion for dwelling the article by previous definitions. There are indeed two words which have given rise to much useless dilutation, which yet cannot be banished from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> philosophy, and which it will therefore be proper here to define. The words to which we allude are idea and notion. These are very generally considered as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYNONYMOUS\">synonymous</a>; but we think that much logomachy might have been avoided by affixing to each a determinate signification. We know not any philosopher who made much use of the word idea before <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a>; but with his mysterious doctrine concerning ideas we have here nothing to do: our present business is to ascertain the precise meaning of the word, which is evidently derived from ido to see, as the word notion is from \"nofo, novi, notum,\" and that from \u03b3\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 to know or understand. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> sense of the two words, therefore, notion is more comprehensive than idea, because we know many things which cannot be seen. We have not a doubt, but that at first the word idea was employed to denote only those forms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> objects which men contemplate in their imaginations, and which are originally received through the senses of sight. Its signification was afterwards extended to the relics of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a>, of touch, taste, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>, as well as of sight; and at last it was confounded with notion, which denotes the mental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of whatever may be known. In our use of the word idea, except when we quote from others, we shall employ it only to denote that appearance which absent objects of sense make in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> or imagination (b); and by the word notion we shall denote our apprehension or knowledge of spirits, and all such things as, though they be the objects of science, cannot be perceived by the external senses. Having said this, we proceed to our inquiries, beginning with that into human understanding.\n\nPART I. OF HUMAN UNDERSTANDING.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">Preliminary</a> Observations on the Origin of our Ideas and Notions.\n\nTHAT the mind of man has no innate ideas or notions, but comes into the world ignorant of everything, is a truth which since the days of Locke has been very little disputed. In the first book of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on the Human Understanding, that acute philosopher has demonstrated, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> or first principles of all our knowledge are communicated to us by sensation; and he has compared the mind, previous to the operation of external objects upon the senses, to a tabula rasa or sheet of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>. To repeat his arguments would swell the article to no purpose. There is not a man capable of attending to his own ideas, who\n\n(b) In thus restricting the meaning of the word idea, we have the honour to agree with the great English Lexicographer.\u2014\"He was particularly indignant against the almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> use of the word idea in the sense of notion or opinion, when it is clear that idea can only signify something of which an image may be formed in the mind. We may have an idea or image of a mountain, a tree, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>; but we cannot surely have an idea or image of an argument or proposition. Yet we hear the sages of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> delivering their ideas upon the question under consideration; and the first speakers in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a> entirely coinciding in the idea, which has been so ably stated by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> member; or representing an idea as unconstitutional, and fraught with the most dangerous consequences to a great and free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. This Johnson called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> cant.\" Boswell's Life of Johnson.\nwho can entertain a doubt in what manner he received them. Without the sense of sight, we could never have known colours; nor sound, without hearing; nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a>, softness, smoothness, pain, or bodily pleasure, without touch; nor odours, without smell, &c.\n\nIf evident as these facts are, objections have been started to the inferences drawn from them; and Locke has been accused of advancing principles subversive of all distinction between truth and falsehood, and favourable of course to universal skepticism.\u2014\"The first book of his Essay, which with submission (says Dr. Beattie*) I think the worst, tends to establish this dangerous doctrine, that the human mind, previous to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>, is as susceptible of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> as of another: a doctrine which, if true, would go near to prove that truth and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> are no better than human contrivances; or at least that they have nothing permanent in their nature, but may be as changeable as the inclinations and capacities of men; and that there is no such thing as common sense in the world. Surely this is not the doctrine which Mr. Locke meant to establish.\" We are so thoroughly satisfied, that it is not, that we cannot help wondering how such inferences could, by a man of learning, genius, and candour, be drawn from anything which is to be found in the Essay on the Human Understanding.\n\nBut the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a> thinks Mr. Locke's \"finile of the mind to white paper one of the most unlucky allusions that could have been chosen; because the human soul, when it begins to think, is not extended, nor of a white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, nor incapable of energy, nor wholly unfurnished with ideas, nor as susceptible of one impression or character as of any other;\" and it has been observed by another objector\u2020, that \"on a sheet of white paper you may write that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a> is bitter; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WORMWOOD\">wormwood</a> sweet; fire and frost in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> pleasing and sufferable: that compassion and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> are base; treachery, falsehood, and envy, noble; and that contempt is indifferent to us.\"\n\nAll this is true; but we apprehend it is not to the purpose. Mr. Locke has no where expressed himself in such a manner as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> us to suppose that he believed the soul to be extended or coloured; or, when it begins to think, incapable of energy, and wholly unfurnished with ideas: but he certainly did believe, that it begins not to think the first instant of its existence, and that it acquires all the ideas of which it is ever possessed. We may undoubtedly write upon a piece of white paper that sugar is bitter, and that wormwood is sweet; but how the capacity of paper to receive the symbols of false <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> should make Mr. Locke's comparison improper or dangerous, we cannot comprehend. Mr. Uther indeed says, that it is improper on this account, \"that no human art or industry is able to make those impressions upon the mind: in respect of them, the mind discovers not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSIVE\">passive</a> capacity, but refutes them with the force of fate.\" Does it indeed? does the mind reject the idea of sugar or of bitterness, of contempt or of indifference? May not any man have the idea of sugar and at the same time the idea of bitterness, and compare the one with the other in his mind, as well as the word sugar may be written beside the word bitter, and connected with it on the same piece of paper? In all this we perceive nothing that is impossible or even difficult.\n\nThe mind cannot indeed be made to feel that sugar has the same taste with wormwood; but who ever thought that it could? Not Mr. Locke, we shall be bold to say; nor does his finile give the smallest countenance to such an absurdity. The author of the Essay on the Human Understanding underlined his subject too well to imagine that either truth or falsehood could be communicated to paper, or that paper is capable of comparing ideas. Paper is capable of receiving nothing but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> or figures; and if passively receives whatever lines or figures we may choose to inscribe on it: yet if a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> be carried over it in a circular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, the figure impressed will not be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>; just as, to the mind of one eating sugar, the taste communicated is not that of wormwood.\n\nOn a piece of paper a circle may be described, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> beside it a square: in like manner an agreeable sensation may be communicated to the mind, and immediately afterwards a sensation that is disagreeable. These two sensations, or the ideas which they leave behind them, may be compared together; and it is certainly true that no art or industry can make them appear similar in the mind: but is it not equally true, that no art or industry can make the circle and the square similar on the paper? The paper is susceptible of any sort of plain figures, and the mind is equally susceptible of any sort of ideas or sensations; but figures dissimilar cannot be made to coincide, neither can discordant ideas be made to agree. Again, one may write upon paper, that \"a circle is a square,\" and likewise that \"a circle is not a square;\" and both these propositions may be communicated to the mind by the organs of sight or of hearing. The paper receives the words expressive of the false as well as those expressive of the true proposition; and the mind receives the ideas and relations signified by the one cluster of words as well as those signified by the other: but in the mind the idea of a square is different from that of a circle, and on the paper the figure of a square is different from the figure of a circle. The great difference between the mind and the paper is, that the former is conscious of its ideas, and perceives their agreement or disagreement; whereas the paper is not conscious of the figures drawn upon it, nor perceives any thing about them. But still those figures are what they are; they either agree or disagree on the paper, as well as the ideas either agree or disagree in the mind. It is not in the power of the mind to alter the ideas of the square and the circle, not in the power of the paper to alter the forms of those figures.\n\nIt appears then, that the principles of Mr. Locke, and the comparison by which he illustrates them, have no more tendency to subvert the difference between truth and falsehood, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> and wrong, than the passiveness of paper has to subvert the difference between a straight line and a crooked, a circle and a square; and with a view to establish the doctrine of innate ideas and instinctive principles of knowledge, we might with as much propriety ask, Whether it be possible to imagine that any mode of manufacture could make paper of such a nature, as that a pen drawn over it in a circular direction would leave the figure of a square? as that, \"Whether it be possible to imagine, that any course of education could ever bring a rational creature to believe that two and two are equal to three.\"\nThe mind being thus, as we may say, originally white paper, void of all characters, without ideas or notions of any kind, the first question which we have to consider is, Whence and in what manner it derives the materials of all its knowledge? To this question the only answer which can be given is, That it derives them from observation and experience; from observation, either employed upon external objects of sense, or turned inwardly upon its own operations. Our senses, conversant about particular external objects, convey into the mind several distinct perceptions; such as those of colour, figure, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, bitterness, sweetness, and all those things which are usually called sensible qualities. The notions, ideas, or whatever else they may be called, which are acquired in this manner, may be called sensible knowledge; and the source of that knowledge is termed sensation.\n\nThe other fountain from which experience furnishes the understanding with knowledge, is that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> which we are capable of giving to the operations of our own minds when employed about those ideas which were originally suggested by objects of sense. These operations, when the soul comes to reflect on them, furnish us with a set of notions entirely different from the ideas of sense; such as the notions of perception, thinking, doubting, believing, reasoning, knowing, willing, and all the different energies and passions of our own minds. Of these operations we are always conscious when we are awake; but it requires, as shall be shown afterwards, no inconsiderable effort to set them, as it were, at a distance, to reflect on them and consider what they are; but when we have made this effort, we acquire notions as distinct, and perhaps more important, than those ideas which we receive through the medium of the senses.\n\nSensation and reflection then furnish mankind with the first materials of all their knowledge. The mind seems not to have ideas or notions of any kind which it did not receive by one or other of these ways. By means of the senses it perceives external objects; and by that power which it has of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> its attention upon itself, it discovers the nature and manner of its own operations.\n\nAlthough the knowledge which we acquire from reflection be of equal importance, and perhaps of greater certainty than that which we receive through the medium of the senses, it comes into the mind at a much later period; both because it is impossible that the faculties of the mind should operate without materials, and because it is much more difficult to attend to these operations even while they are going on, than to the objects of sense which solicit our attention. It is for this reason pretty late before children have any notions whatever of the operations of their own minds; and of the greater part of these operations the bulk of mankind have no clear or accurate notions during their whole lives. On the other hand, every human being is so surrounded with bodies, which perpetually and variously affect his senses, that a variety of sensible ideas force an entrance even into the minds of children. In order therefore to trace the procedure of the understanding, and to ascertain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> and limits of human knowledge, it should seem that we must begin with considering the external senses, that we may discover the manner in which we receive knowledge by means of them, the objects of that knowledge, and its certainty. It is to be observed, however, that though we consider the mind as possessed of many powers or faculties, and inquire first into the nature of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> which we conceive to be first exerted, this is done merely for the sake of proceeding in our subject with method and perspicuity. The mind is one simple and undivided being; and in every mental energy it is the whole mind, and not any part or portion of it, that is energetic. On this account, it is impossible to explain even the nature of sensation and perception to him who knows not what is meant by will and understanding; but to every one who is acquainted with the common import of these words, and who has read the short system of Logic inserted in this Work, we hope that our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of perception will be intelligible and convincing.\n\nChap. I. Of Sensation and Perception.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">Sect</a>. I. Of Sensation.\n\nThe Supreme Being, who made us and placed us in this world, has given us such powers of mind as by five organs he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> to be suited to our state and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>. He has given us the power of perceiving many objects around us; but that power is limited in various ways; and particularly in this, that without the organs of the several senses we perceive no external <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>. The senses, as every one knows, are five in number, and each communicates its proper sensation. It is by the eyes alone that we see, by the ears that we hear, by the nose that we smell, and by the tongue and palate that we taste; the sense of feeling or touch is spread over the whole body, for we feel equally by our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> and by our feet, &c. To the powers of perception by the senses it is necessary not only that we have all the organs enumerated, but that we have them also in a sound and natural state. There are many disorders of the eye which cause total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BLINDNESS\">blindness</a>, as well as others which impair without destroying the power of vision. The same thing is true of the organs of all the other senses.\n\nAll this is so well known from experience, that it needs no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>; but it may be worth while to observe, that it is known from experience only*. For any thing that we know to the contrary, our Creator might have endowed us with the power of perception by a thousand intellectual organs of sense, all different from those which we possess; and it is certain that he himself perceives every thing more perfectly than we do without bodily organs. For it is to be observed, that the organs of sense are different from the being which is sentient.\u2014It is not the eye which sees, nor the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a> which hears; these are sentient, only the organs by which we see and hear. A man cannot see the satellites of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> but by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TELESCOPE\">telescope</a>, nor hear a low voice but by means of an ear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRUMPET\">trumpet</a>. Does he from this conclude that it is the telescope which sees those satellites, or the trumpet which hears that voice? Such a conclusion would be evidently absurd. It is no less absurd to conclude that it is the eye which sees, or the ear which hears. The telescope and the trumpet are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> organs of sight and of hearing, of which the eye and the ear are natural organs; but the natural organs see and hear as little as the artificial.\n\nThat this is the case with respect to the eye and the ear,\near, is so obvious, that, as far as we know, it has never been denied. But with respect to the senses of touch, taste, and smell, the truth at first view appears not so evident. A celebrated writer has observed*, that \"after the utmost efforts, we find it beyond our power to conceive the flavour of a rose to exist in the mind: we are necessarily led to conceive that pleasure as existing in the nostrils, along with the impression made by the rose upon that organ (c); and the same will be the result of experiments with respect to every feeling of taste, touch, and smell. Touch (he says), affords the most satisfactory evidence, and philosophy detects the delusion.\" To detect this delusion requires, indeed, no great depth in philosophy; for it is so far from being true that we are necessarily led otherwise than by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a>, of which the laws shall be explained afterwards, to conceive the pleasure or pain of touch as existing at that part of our body upon which the impression is made, that, as every man must have observed, children previous to experience cannot distinguish the precise place of their bodies which is affected by the touch of any external object. Nay, we believe it will be found upon trial, that if a full grown man, with all the experience of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> to guide him, be pricked with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">pin</a> on any part of his body which he has seldom handled, and never seen, he will not readily nor at first put his finger upon the wound, nor even come very near to the wound. This, however, he would certainly and infallibly do were the sense of touch necessarily conceived as existing at the organ. To these observations objections may perhaps be made, which we cannot stay to obviate; but the following, we think, will admit of none. We <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to every man who has experienced that particular sensation of touch which Scaliger dignified with the name of a fifth sense, whether, whilst those sensations were new to him, he was necessarily led to conceive them as existing at any particular organ. If he was not, it follows undeniably that the organs of sensation are different from the being which is sentient; that it is not the eye which sees, the ear which hears, the nostrils which smell, the tongue which tastes, nor any part of the body which feels; and that it is by experience that we learn to associate our several sensations with those organs upon which the impressions are made.\n\nIt is, however, certain that we receive no sensation from external objects, unless when some impression is made upon the organ of sense, either by the immediate application of the object itself, or by some medium which passes between the object and the organ\u2020. In two of our senses, viz. touch and taste, there must be an immediate application of the object to the organ. In the other three the sensation is occasioned by the impression of some medium passing from the object to the organ. The effluvia of bodies drawn into the nostrils with the breath are the medium of smell; the undulations of the air are the medium of hearing; and the rays of light passing from visible objects to the eye are the medium of sight. These are facts known from experience to hold universally both in men and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUTES\">brutes</a>. It is likewise a law of our nature perfectly known to all who know anything of anatomy, that in order to actual sensation the impressions made upon the external organs must be communicated to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a>, and from them to the brain. First, the object, either immediately, or by some medium, makes an impression upon the organ; the organ serves only as a medium, by which the impression is communicated to the nerves; and the nerves serve as a medium to carry it on to the brain. Here the corporeal part ends; at least we can trace it no farther. The rest is all intellectual.\n\nThe proof of these impressions upon the nerves and brain in sensation is this, that from many observations and experiments it is found, that when the organ of any sense is perfectly found, and has the impression made upon it by the object ever so strongly, yet if the nerve which serves that organ be cut or tied hard, there is no sensation; and it is well known that disorders in the brain deprive us of sensation, while both the organ and its nerve are sound.\n\nThere is sufficient reason, therefore, to conclude, that in sensation the object produces some change in nature in the organ; that from the organ the change proceeds to the nerve, and from the nerve to the brain. Hence it is that we have positive sensations, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a> objects, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> nonentities, such as darkness, blackness, and vacancy. For, sensation resulting from changes in the brain, whatever produces any change must of course occasion a new sensation: but it is obvious, that the mere absence of any impression, by the removal of the object which produced it, must as necessarily cause a change in the organ, nerves, and brain, as the presence of a new impression from a new object. To these changes, or that which immediately produces them, we give the name of impressions; because we know not how, in a general manner, to express more properly any change produced by an external cause without specifying the nature of that cause. Whether it be pressure, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a>, or repulsion, or vibration, or something unknown, for which we have no name, still it may be called an impression.\n\nSir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton was perhaps the first who supposed that the rays of light falling upon the bottom of the eye excite vibrations in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TUNICA\">tunica</a> retina; and that those vibrations being propagated along the solid fibres of the optic nerves into the brain, cause the actual sensation of seeing. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> was adopted by Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARTLEY\">Hartley</a>, applied to the other senses, and shown to be\n\n(c) Another eminent writer thinks on this subject very differently, and in our opinion much more justly.\u2014\"Suppose (says Dr Reid) a person who never had this sense (viz. smell) before, to receive it all at once, and to smell a rose; can he perceive any similarity or agreement between the smell and the rose? or indeed between it and any other object whatever? Certainly he cannot. He finds himself affected in a new way, he knows not why, or from what cause. He is conscious that he is not the cause of it himself; but he cannot from the nature of the thing determine whether it be caused by body or spirit; by something near, or by something at a distance. He cannot give it a place any more than he can give a place to melancholy or joy; nor can he conceive it to have any existence but when it is smelled.\" Inquiry into the Human Mind, ch. 2. sect. 2.\nOf Perception be at least as probable as any which has yet been invented to account for the perception of external objects by means of the organs of sense. Be this as it may, experience informs us, that whatever be the nature of those impressions and changes which are made by external objects upon the senses, nerves, and brain, we have without them no actual sensation, and of course perceive nothing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">ab</a> extra. Hence it has been supposed, that the mind is wholly passive in sensation, and that sensation is necessarily produced by those impressions. But this we believe to be a mistake. Every man who has been attentive to his own thoughts and actions, must know instances of impressions having been certainly made upon his organs of sense without producing any sensation, or forgetting to his mind the perception of the particular objects by which the impressions were caused. His whole mind is intensely employed in any particular pursuit, may have his eyes open upon an object which he does not see; or he may not hear the sound of a clock striking within two yards of him: Nay, we will venture to affirm, that there is hardly one reader of this article to whom such absences of sensation have not often occurred. Now, as there is no reason to suppose, that in the case the undulations of the air, caused by the striking of the clock, did not reach his ears, or that in the other rays of light, reflected from the object, did not fall upon his eyes, which were open to receive them; the only reason which can be assigned for his not having, in these instances, had audible and visible sensations, is, that his mind was so engaged in something else as not to pay to the vibrations in his brain that attention, if we may say, without which impressions ab extra can produce no sensation. There are, indeed, some impressions on the organs of sense so violent and so sudden, as to force themselves upon the mind however employed. Such are those made on the ear by thunder, and on the eye by strong light. In these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, sensation is involuntary and unavoidable; whence we conclude, not that in such instances the mind is passive or destitute of energy, but that by the violent agitation given to the brain, it is roused from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REVERIE\">reverie</a>, and compelled to give attention. It appears, therefore, that in sensation the mind exerts some kind of energy; for in nothing but in the sentient being itself can we seek for the cause why, when all external circumstances are the same, organic impressions sometimes produce sensations and sometimes not; and that cause can only be the energy of the mind; what kind of energy, we pretend not to say.\n\nSect. II. Of Perception by the Senses.\n\nHow the correspondence is carried on between the thinking principle within us and the material world without us, has always, as Dr Reid observes, been found a very difficult <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> to those philosophers who consider themselves as obliged to account for every phenomenon in nature. It is, indeed, a problem of which we expect not to see a complete solution. A few steps beyond the vulgar we may certainly go; but the nature of that connexion by which the mind and body are united, will probably remain for ever unknown. One question, however, which has employed much of the attention of philosophers, both ancient and modern, appears to be not wholly unanswerable. It is, Whether by means of our senses we perceive external objects immediately or immediately; or in other words, Whether sensation and perception be one and the same thing, or two things succeeding each other? On this subject, till of late, there appears to have been in the main a great uniformity in the sentiments of philosophers, notwithstanding their variations respecting particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>. Of some of the most eminent of them, we shall give the opinions as we find them collected by one* who is well acquainted with their writings, who is thoroughly qualified to estimate their respective merits, and who cannot be suspected of partiality to that theory which we feel ourselves compelled to adopt.\n\n\"Plato illustrates our manner of perceiving external objects thus: He supposes a dark subterranean cave, in which men <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> bound in such a manner as that Plato; they can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> their eyes only to one part of the cave. Far behind there is a light, of which some rays come over a wall to that part of the cave which is before the eyes of our prisoners. A number of men variously employed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> between them and the light, whose shadows are seen by the prisoners, but not their persons themselves. In this manner did that philosopher conceive that by our senses we perceive not things themselves, but only the shadows of things; and he seems to have borrowed his notions on this subject from the disciples of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGORAS\">Pythagoras</a>.\n\n\"If we make due allowance for Plato's allegorical genius, his sentiments with respect to sensation and perception correspond very well with those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIPATETICS\">Peripatetics</a>. Aristotle, the founder of that school, seems to have thought, that the soul consists of two or three parts, or rather that we have three souls\u2014the vegetable, the animal, and the rational. The animal soul he held to be a certain form of the body, which is inseparable from it, and perishes at death. To this soul the senses belong; and he defines a sense to be that which is capable of receiving the sensible forms, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of objects, without any of the matter of them; as wax receives the form of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a> without any of its matter. Of this doctrine it seems to be a necessary consequence, that bodies are constantly sending forth, in all directions, as many different kinds of forms without matter as they have different sensible qualities. This was accordingly maintained by the followers of Aristotle, though not, as far as we know, taught by himself. They disputed concerning the nature of these forms or species, whether they were real beings or nonentities: but of matter and form we shall have occasion to speak afterwards.\n\n\"After Aristotle had kept possession of the schools for more than a thousand years, his authority, which Cartes had often supplied the place of argument, was called in question by Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a> and others. Des Cartes, however, was the first philosopher who, convinced of the defects of the prevailing system, attempted to form another entirely new: but on the nature of perception by means of the senses he differs little or nothing from those who had preceded him in that department of science. He denies, indeed, and refutes by solid reasoning, the doctrine which maintains that images, species, or forms of external objects, come from the objects themselves, and enter into the mind by the avenues...\"\nOf Percep-\ntion.\n\navenues of the senses. But he takes it for granted, as all the old philosophers had done, that what we immediately perceive must be either in the mind itself, or in the brain, in which the mind is immediately present. The impressions made upon our organs, nerves, and brain, can be nothing, according to his philosophy, but various modifications of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a>, figure, and motion. There can be nothing in the brain like found or colour, taste or smell, heat or cold. These are sensations in the mind, which, by the laws of the union of the soul and body, are raised on occasion of certain traces in the brain; and although he sometimes gives the name of ideas to these traces, he does not think it necessary that they should be perfectly like the things which they represent, any more than that words and signs should resemble the things which they signify.\n\nAccording to this system it would appear, that we perceive not external objects directly by means of our senses; but that these objects, operating either immediately or immediately upon the organs of sense, and they again upon our nerves and brain, excite in the mind certain sensations; whence we infer the existence of external objects from our sensations of which they are the cause. Perception of external objects, therefore, according to Des Cartes, is not one simple original act of the mind, but may be resolved into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of reasoning from effects to causes.\n\nThe doctrines of Malebranche, Locke, and Hartley, respecting perception, differ not essentially from that of Des Cartes. Malebranche, indeed, supposes, that external objects are not themselves the causes of perception; but that the Deity, being always present to our minds more intimately than any other being, does, upon occasion of the impressions made upon our organs of sense, discover to us, as far as he thinks proper, and according to fixed laws, his own ideas of the object: and thus, according to him, we see all things in God, or in the divine ideas. He agrees, however, with Des Cartes and the ancient philosophers, in considering it as a truth which it is impossible to refute, that we perceive not the objects without us, the sun, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, and stars, &c., because it is not likely that the soul falls out of the body, and takes a walk, as it were, through the heavens to contemplate these objects. She sees them not therefore by themselves; and the immediate object of the mind, when it sees the sun, is not the sun itself, but something which is intimately united to the mind, and is that which he calls an idea.\n\nLocke, speaking of the reality of our knowledge, says: \"It is evident the mind knows not things immediately, but only by the intervention of the ideas it has of them. Our knowledge, therefore, according to him, is real only so far as there is a conformity between our ideas and the things which they represent.\"\n\nThe manner of our perceiving external objects he illustrates by the following similitude: \"Methinks the understanding is not much unlike a closet wholly shut from light, with only some little opening left, to let in external visible resemblances or ideas of things without. Would the pictures coming into such a dark room but stay there, and lie so orderly as to be found upon occasion, it would very much resemble the understanding of a man in reference to all objects of sight, and the ideas of them.\" He has elsewhere defined an idea thus: \"Whatsoever the mind perceives in itself, or is the immediate object of perception, thought, or understanding, that I call an idea; and the power to produce any idea in our mind, I call finding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the subject wherein the power is.\" He likewise thinks it \"easy to draw this observation, that the ideas of what he calls primary qualities of bodies, viz. extension, solidity, figure, mobility, &c., are resemblances of these qualities as they really exist in the bodies themselves.\"\n\nThis unguarded expression, which affirms that ideas in the mind are the resemblances of external things, has brought upon Mr Locke much undeserved ridicule. That on this and other occasions he uses the word idea with too great latitude, and that he often confounds ideas with sensations, and even with the causes of sensation, must be admitted by his warmest admirers: but we believe, that by an attentive reader, who peruses his whole work, and compares such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> as are obscure with those which are clearer, his meaning may always be discovered, and with respect to sensation and perception will generally be found just. That by calling the ideas of primary qualities resemblances of the qualities themselves, he meant nothing more than that bodies in all possible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> impress the senses, nerves, and brain, in such a manner as to produce in the mind certain sensations, between which and those impressions there is an inseparable, though unknown, connection, is evident from the account which he gives of the manner of perception. \"Our senses (says he), conversant about particular sensible objects, do convey into the mind several distinct perceptions of things, according to those various ways in which these objects affect them: and thus we come by those ideas we have of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>, white, heat, cold, soft, hard, bitter, sweet, and all those which we call sensible qualities; which when I say the senses convey into the mind, I mean, they from external objects convey into the mind what produces those perceptions.\" And as bodies can act only by impulse, he adds, that \"those perceptions can be produced only by an impression made upon the senses, and some motion thence <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> by our nerves to the brain or seat of perception.\"\n\nDr Hartley was the pupil of Locke and Newton, and has, in a more satisfactory manner than all who had preceded or have since followed him, explained the material part of the process of perception. His principles we shall have occasion, during the course of the article, to develop pretty fully. For our present purpose it is sufficient to say, that all his observations and arguments evidently suppose, that nothing distant from the mind can be perceived in the immediate act of sensation; but that the apparently immediate perception of external objects is an instance of early and deep-rooted association.\n\nIn this sentiment Mr Hume agrees with his predecessor; but he obscures his philosophy, and misleads his reader, by confounding sensations with the impressions from which they proceed. \"Every one (says he) will allow, that there is a considerable difference between the perceptions of the mind, when a man feels the pain of excessive heat, or the pleasure of moderate warmth, and when he afterwards recalls to his memory this sensation, or anticipates it by his imagination.\"\nChap.

His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> was first unfolded by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> of Tasso; and he began to compose verses at ten years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. \"A prodigy of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> (says Metastasio) made such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> on my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, the celebrated Gravina, that he thenceforth considered me as a plant worthy of being cultivated by his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>.\" Metastasio was only fourteen years of age when he composed his tragedy entitled Il Giustino; in which he appears too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> and scrupulous an imitator of the Grecian drama. Our young poet unfortunately lost his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> in 1717; who left him his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a>, \"as being a young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of the most promising abilities.\" Metastasio, at the age of nineteen, being, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this inheritance, superior to those wants which require the exertions of genius, and to which men of abilities are too often subject, gave full scope to his inclination for poetry. He began his dramatic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> with the Didone Abbandonata, which was acted at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a> in 1724; the music was composed by Sarro. He soon acquired such celebrity, that in 1729 he was invited to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> VI.; who appointed him imperial poet, and granted him a pension of 4000 florins. From that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> some of his works were presented at every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> festival; and notwithstanding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> magnificence of these entertainments, they would now be forgotten were it not for the verses which he composed upon the occasion. The courts of Vienna and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MADRID\">Madrid</a> vied with each other in the present which they conferred upon him. From <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARIA\">Maria</a> Theresa he received a snuff-box and a port-folio set with diamonds, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> candelstick with a screen. Ferdinand VI., <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, informed of the great merit of Metastasio by Farinelli, of whom he was a passionate admirer, sent him a present of a casket mounted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, and furnished with the different implements of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>. This favourite of kings and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSES\">muses</a> was of a cheerful temper, and was exceedingly temperate: to this he was probably indebted for the uninterrupted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> which he enjoyed, and for the entire possession of his senses and faculties to the most advanced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of old age. He took his meals, arose, and went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a>, always at stated hours. This exactness and order were scrupulously observed even in the most trifling actions of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. He used to say in jest, that he dreaded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HELL\">hell</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other reason but because it was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> ubi nulius ordo, sed sempiternus horror inhabitat. He had even his stated hours for making verses; to which he scrupulously adhered, without waiting for the moment of poetical enthusiasm. He was equally regular in the duties of the Christian as in the labours of the scholar. His behaviour was that of a true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>: his ambition extended no farther than the attainment of literary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>; and he despised every civil mark of distinction. When Charles VI. offered him the titles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a>, which add no real worth or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> to the possessor, but frequently make him appear in a more ridiculous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, he instantly begged the favour that he would allow him still to continue Metastasio. The empress Maria Theresa afterwards wished to bestow upon him the small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> of St Stephen; but he excused himself on account of his age, which would prevent him from attending at the festivals of the order. He was attacked by a fever on the 2d of April 1782; and he died on the 12th of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, at the age of 84. Before his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> he received the sacrament according to the form of the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>; and Pius VI. who was then at Vienna, sent him his apostolical benediction in articulo mortis. He left about 150,000 florins. He composed a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of tragic operas, and several small dramatic pieces which have been set to music. We have different editions of them in 4to, 8vo, and 12mo; and M. Richelet has published a translation of them into French, in 12 vols, small 12mo.\n\nThe greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of Metastasio's writings <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> confer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMMORTALITY\">immortality</a> on their author. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIALOGUE\">dialogue</a> is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a>,\nMetastasio, simple, and easy; his style is always pure and elegant, and sometimes sublime and pathetic. His subjects are noble, interesting, and excellently adapted for representation. He was perfectly acquainted with the resources of his art, and has subjected the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPERA\">opera</a> to rules. He stripped it of its machinery, and of the marvellous, which was fitted to excite the gaze of astonishment, but which gave no instruction to the understanding, and made no impression on the heart. His descriptions are copied from nature; the situations of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> never fail to raise an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> in the reader, and often excite the tear of pity. His fables are celebrated; his characters are noble and well supported; his plots are excellently conducted, and happily unravelled. \"There are scenes (says Voltaire) worthy of Corneille when he does not declaim, and of Racine when he is not feeble.\" His operas, in point of the pathetic, may be compared with our finest tragedies; and may be read with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, independent of the charms of the music. We must not, however, expect to find in Metastasio that exact regularity, and that fertile simplicity, which constitutes the excellence of some of our tragic poets: But though he sometimes transgresses the unities of time and place, he always preserves the unity of interest. Notwithstanding all these advantages, some critics will not allow him the merit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, which is the first qualification of a poet. They consider him only as a successful imitator of the French tragic writers, from whom a great part of his beauties are borrowed, and place him at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the finest wits in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, but deny that he possessed genius. He was a fond admirer of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>; and this admiration, increasing with the solidity of his understanding, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to the last period of his life. He recommended reading them, as he himself had done, in a chronological order. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> was excellent, and continued unimpaired even in old age. Horace was his favourite author, and he could repeat almost the whole of his verses. Metastasio, who, as we have observed, was the pupil of the celebrated Gravina, added a gentleness of character peculiar to himself to the accuracy of thinking and great erudition of his master. His abilities and fame were respected by the critics in general; and whereas the life of most men of letters is one continued warfare, his days happily glided away in tranquillity and peace.\n\nThe circumstance which occasioned the change of his name is thus related in a late anecdote: \"Gravina's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARBER\">barber</a>, who, like most of his profession, was a great talker, one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> informed him, that in the Place de la Valicella, where he had his shop, a young boy came every evening, and sung extempore verses of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, so harmonious and elegant that all the passersby stopped to listen to them. Gravina, upon this information, added one to the number of the young poet's audience, and found the verses so superior to the idea which he had formed of them from the account of the barber, and so much above the capacity of a child of ten or eleven years of age, that he instantly determined to undertake the cultivation of so promising a plant. His first care was to put the young Trapassi (which was the boy's name) to school; but apprehending that the ordinary methods of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> might check the progress of so uncommon talent, he took him home to his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, and changed his name into Metastasio, which signifies the same thing in Greek. In short, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of education and by instructions suited to his genius, Gravina laid the foundation of that reputation which he predicted, and which Metastasio now enjoys.\" Vies des Hommes Illustres d'Italie, tom. i. p. 187.","sp":293,"ep":294},{"h":"METASTASIS","t":"in medicine, a transposition <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> settlement of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> in some other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a>; and sometimes it signifies such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> of a disease as is succeeded by a solution.","sp":294,"ep":294},{"h":"METATARSUS","t":"in anatomy, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> skeleton containing the middle of the foot.

The parching <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> is never felt; the thick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a> of trees, and thousands of crystal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> which everywhere arise and form themselves into unnumbered rivulets, joined to the refreshing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> breeze, the constant corrective and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a> of noontide heat, qualify the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> and render the year a never-ending May. The houses are constructed in such a manner as to have the best view of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> beauties. Each is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> tower neatly built of hewn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> as to overtop the trees, and to command a view of the sea and neighbouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>. The lower stories are granaries and storehouses; and the habitable apartments are all at the top, to which you ascend by a stone stair, built for the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> on the outside, and surrounding the tower; so that from the apartment the trees are overlooked, and the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> is seen; while the habitations themselves, which are very numerous, peering above the groves, add <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> and variety to the enchanting prospect, and give an air of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> to these woodlands, which might otherwise be supposed the region of Dryads, of Naiads, and of Satyrs.\"\n\nThe most remarkable thing, however, in this island is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> by which the women have here openly usurped those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of sovereignty which in other countries\ncountries are supposed to belong essentially to the men.\n\n\"Contrary (says his lordship) to the usage of all other countries, the eldest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> here inherits; and the sons, like daughters everywhere else, are portioned off with small dowers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a>, which is still worse, turned out penniless to seek their fortune. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> have two daughters, the eldest, at her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>, is entitled to all her mother's possessions, which are by far the greater part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> estate, as the mother, keeping up her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREROGATIVE\">prerogative</a>, never parts with the power over any portion of what she has brought into the family, until she is forced into it by the marriage of her daughter; and the father also is compelled to ruin himself by adding whatever he may have scraped together by his industry. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> daughter inherits nothing, and is condemned to perpetual celibacy. She is styled a calogria, which signifies properly a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> woman or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUN\">nun</a>, and is in effect a menial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> to her sister, being employed by her in any office she may think fit to impose, frequently serving her as waitingmaid, as cook, and often in employments still more degrading. She wears a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> peculiar to her situation, which she can never change; a sort of monastic dress, coarse, and of a dark <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>. One advantage, however, she enjoys over her sister, that whereas the elder, before marriage, is never allowed to go abroad, or to see any man, her nearest relations only excepted, the calogria, except when employed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> toil, is in this respect at perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>. But when the sister is married, the situation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> calogria becomes desperate indeed, and is rendered still more humiliating by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> between her condition and that of her happy mistress. The married sister enjoys every sort of liberty; the whole family fortune is hers, and she spends it as she pleases; her husband is her obsequious servant, her father and mother are dependent upon her, she dresses in a most magnificent manner, covered all over, according to the fashion of the island, with pearls and with pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> sequins; thus continually carrying about her the enviable marks of affluence and superiority, while the wretched calogria follows her as a servant, arrayed in simple homespun brown, and without the most distant hope of ever changing her condition. Such a disparity may seem intolerable, but what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not custom reconcile? Neither are the misfortunes of the family yet at an end. The father and mother, with what little is left them, contrive by their industry to accumulate a second little fortune; and this, if they should have a third daughter, they are obliged to give to her upon her marriage; and the fourth, if there should be one, becomes her calogria; and so on through all the daughters alternately. Whenever the daughter is marriageable, she can by custom compel the father to procure her a husband; and the mother, such is the power of habit, is foolish enough to join her in tempting him into an immediate compliance, though its consequences must be equally fatal and ruinous to both of them. From hence it happens, that nothing is more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> than to see the old father and mother reduced to the utmost indigence, and even begging about the streets, while their unnatural daughters are in affluence; and we ourselves have frequently been shown the eldest daughter parading it through the town in the greatest splendour, while her mother and sister followed her as servants, and made a melancholy part of her attendant train.\n\n\"The sons, as soon as they are of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> a livelihood, are turned out of the family, sometimes with a small present or portion, but more frequently without anything to support them; and thus reduced, they either endeavour to live by their labour, or, which is more usual, go on board some trading vessel as sailors or as servants, remaining abroad till they have got together some competency, and then return home to marry and to be hanged. Some few there are who, taking advantage of the Turkish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> through this whimsical custom, who marry their calogrias, and retain to themselves a competent provision: but these are accounted men of a singular and even criminal disposition, and are hated and despised as conformists to Turkish manners, and deserters of their native customs; so that we may suppose they are few indeed who have the boldness to depart from the manners of their country, to adopt the customs of their detested masters, and to brave the contempt, the derision, and the hatred, of their neighbours and fellow-citizens.\n\n\"Of all these extraordinary particulars I was informed by the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSUL\">consul</a>, a man of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> and of indisputable veracity, who had resided in this island for several years, and who solemnly assured me that every circumstance was true: but indeed our own observation left us without the least room for doubt, and the singular appearance and deportment of the ladies fully evinced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of our friend's relation. In walking through the town, it is easy to perceive, from the whimsical manners of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> passengers, that the women, according to the vulgar phrase, wear the breeches. They frequently stopped us in the streets, examined our dress, interrogated us with a bold and manly air, laughed at our foreign garb and appearance; and showed so little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to that decent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a> which is or ought to be the true characteristic of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>, that there is every reason to suppose they would, in spite of their haughtiness, be the kindest ladies upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, if they were not strictly watched by the Turks, who are here very numerous, and would be ready to punish any transgression of their ungallant laws with arbitrary fines. But <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> and native manners will often baffle the efforts even of tyranny. In all their customs these manly ladies seem to have changed sexes with the men. The woman rides astride, the man sits sideways upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>; nay, I have been assured that the husband's distinguishing appellation is his wife's family name. The women have town and country houses, in the management of which the husband never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DARES\">dares</a> interfere. Their gardens, their servants, are all their own; and the husband, from every circumstance of his behaviour, appears to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other than his wife's first domestic, perpetually bound to her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, and slave to her caprice. Hence it is that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a> obtains in the country, that this island was formerly inhabited by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMAZONS\">Amazons</a>; a tradition, however, founded upon no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> that I know of. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAPPHO\">Sappho</a> indeed, the most renowned female that this island has ever produced, is said to have had manly inclinations; in which, as Lucian informs us, she did but conform with the singular manners of her countrywomen: but I do not find that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> in which\nthe choice to show these inclinations is imitated by the present female inhabitants, who seem perfectly content with the dear prerogative of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> sway, without endeavouring in any other particular to change the course of nature; yet will this circumstance serve to show, that the women of Lesbos had always something peculiar, and even peculiarly masculine, in their manners and propensities. But be this as it may, it is certain that no country whatsoever can afford a more perfect idea of an Amazonian commonwealth, or better serve to render probable those ancient relations which our manners would induce us to esteem incredible, than this island of Metelin. These lordly ladies are for the most part very handsome in spite of their dress, which is singular and disadvantageous. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">Down</a> to the girdle, which as in the old Grecian garb is raised far above what we usually call the waist, they wear nothing but a shift of thin and transparent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAUZE\">gauze</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>, green, or brown, through which everything is visible, their breasts only excepted, which they cover with a sort of handkerchief; and this, as we were informed, the Turks have obliged them to wear, while they look upon it as an encumbrance, and as no inconsiderable portion of Turkish tyranny. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">Long</a> sleeves of the same thin material perfectly show their arms even to the shoulder. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> ornaments are chains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEARL\">pearl</a>, to which they hang small pieces of gold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COIN\">coin</a>. Their eyes are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> and fine; and the nose, which we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> Grecian, usually prevails among them, as it does indeed among the women of all these islands. Their complexions are naturally fine; but they spoil them by paint, of which they make abundant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>; and they disfigure their pretty faces by shaving the hinder part of the eyebrow, and replacing it with a straight line of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> neatly applied with some sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>, the brow being thus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in a straight and narrow line till it joins the hair on each side of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a>. They are well made, of the middle size, and for the most part plump; but they are distinguished by nothing so much and so universally as by a haughty, disdainful, and supercilious air, with which they seem to look down upon all mankind as creatures of an inferior nature, born for their service, and doomed to be their slaves; neither does this peculiarity of countenance in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> diminish their natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, but rather adds to it that sort of bewitching <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> which the French call piquant.\"\n\nHis lordship has been at great pains to investigate the origin of such a singular custom; but is unable to find any other example in history than that of the Lycians, who called themselves by the names of their mothers, and not of their fathers. When asked by their neighbours who they were? they described themselves by their maternal genealogy. If a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> should marry a slave, the children by that marriage were accounted noble; but though the first man among them marry a foreign woman, the children would be accounted ignoble. This custom is mentioned by several ancient authors. A difficulty of no little magnitude occurs, however, in accounting for the derivation of the inhabitants of Lesbos from the Lycians. This is solved in the following manner: In times of the most remote antiquity, the island of Lesbos was peopled by the Pelasgi, who, under their leader Xanthus, the son of Triopas <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARGOS\">Argos</a>, first inhabited Lesbos; previous to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> they had dwelt in a certain part of Metellus Lycia which they had conquered; and in this country we may suppose they had learned the custom in question.","sp":294,"ep":296},{"h":"METELLUS","t":"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SURNAME\">surname</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of the Caecilii at Rome, the most known of whom were \u2014A general who defeated the Achaeans, took Thebes, and invaded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACEDONIA\">Macedonia</a>, &c.\u2014Q.

Lucan treats this doctrine as a kind of officious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a>, contrived to mitigate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of death, by persuading men that they only changed their lodging, and only ceased to live to begin a new life.\n\nReuchlin denies this doctrine; and maintains that the metempsychosis of Pythagoras implied nothing more than a similitude of manners, desires, and studies, formerly existing in some person deceased, and now revived in another alive. Thus when it was said that Euphorbus was revived in Pythagoras, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more was meant than that the martial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> which had shone in Euphorbus at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of the Trojan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, was now, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, revived in Pythagoras, by reason of the great respect he bore the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATHLETE\">athlete</a>. For those people wondering how a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> should be so much taken with men of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>, he palliated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, by saying, that the soul of Euphorbus, i.e., his genius, disposition, and inclinations, were revived in him. And this gave occasion to the report, that Euphorbus's soul, who perished in the Trojan war, had transmigrated into Pythagoras.\n\nFicinus affirms, that what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a> speaks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIGRATION\">migration</a> of a human soul into a brute, is intended allegorically, and is to be understood only of the manners, affections, and habits, degenerated into a beastly nature by vice. Serranus, though he allows some force to this interpretation, yet inclines rather to understand the metempsychosis of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESURRECTION\">resurrection</a>.\n\nPythagoras is said to have borrowed the notion of a metempsychosis from the Egyptians; others say, from the ancient Brahmins.

So extremely are they bigotted to it, that they not only forbear eating any thing that has life, but many of them even refuse to defend themselves from wild beasts.

When there is a metempsyphos without a proempsyphos, the next following, or lower index, must be taken. 2. When there is a proempsyphos without a metempsyphos, the next preceding or superior index is to be taken. 3. When there are both a metempsyphos and a proempsyphos, or when there is neither the one nor the other, the same index is preserved. Thus, in 1600, we had D: in 1700, by reason of the metempsyphos, C was taken: in 1800, there was both a proempsyphos and a metempsyphos; so the same index was retained. In 1900, there will be a metempsyphos again, when B will be taken; which will be preserved in 2000, because there will then be neither the one nor the other. This is as far as we need compute for it: But Clavius has calculated a cycle of 301,800 years; at the end of which period, the same indices return in the same order.\n\nSee **EPACT**.","sp":296,"ep":297},{"h":"METEOR","t":"(by the Greeks called \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03c9\u03be\u03b1, q.d. sublima <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> raised;\" by the Latins impressiones as making signs or impressions in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>), <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> denotes any bodies in the air that are of a transitory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>.

With due deference, however, to some philosophers of name, we are not prepared to assert, that it implies impossibility.

At all events, the same Being who called into existence those sublime and countless masses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> which revolve in space, may, to serve purposes unknown to us, create bodies of dimensions infinitely smaller, and destined to impinge on some planetary orb. The reasoning of an angel may not convince us, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> is greater than the whole, or that the value of two and two is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to five; but a very ordinary logician may prove to our satisfaction, that the contact of particles of matter in portions of space which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> beyond our globe, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> chimerical supposition. Every thing around us proclaims, that matter is subject to incessant change. New forms and new modifications are ever springing into being: and can we doubt, that the same particles, as they may happen to be affected or influenced by various circumstances, may exist in the state of gas, of aqueous vapour, or of a concrete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>?\n\nAgain,\nAgain, it surely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not be seriously maintained, that, from the rarity of a phenomenon, we are warranted to infer its nonexistence. The appearance of a comet is rare, but not a fictitious occurrence. Nay, we may safely advance a step farther, and assert, without fear of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUTATION\">confutation</a>, that the existence of a phenomenon, if otherwise well attested, cannot be disproved by our inability to explain it. How multiplied, in fact, are the subjects, even of our daily and hourly observation, which we cannot satisfactorily expound? We cannot say why a small seed should gradually unfold into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> tree, why <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> should produce <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, why the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> in immediate subserviency to the will, or why a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTUSION\">contusion</a> of the brain should induce stupor, alienation of mind, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. It is one thing to prove a fact, and it is another to account for it.\n\nFrom these premises it follows in course, that we are not entitled to reject the existence of meteoric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, provided it be established by valid testimony. Should the historical evidence, on a fair and disinterested review, be deemed conclusive, we may afterwards examine the theories which have been propounded for the solution of the appearance.\n\nFrom the Scriptures of the Old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a> we are not aware that any passage can be cited in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> corroboration of the descent of stones from the atmosphere. The ingenious and fanciful Mr Edward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a>, indeed, in his \"Remarks concerning stones said to have fallen from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a>, both in these days, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> times,\" adverts to the 11th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a> of the 18th Psalm.\u2014The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> also thundered out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>, and the Highest gave his thunder: hail-stones and coals of fire.\" This last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> has, no doubt, been conjectured to denote real hard bodies, in a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNITION\">ignition</a>; and the term \u1f00\u03b2\u03bf\u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2, employed by the cautious Seventy, rather favours such an interpretation. The same expression, however, occurs in the preceding verse, without admitting this interpretation; and the phrase seems to be only a figurative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of describing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a>. In the sober latitudes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>, and even in colloquial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, we talk of balls of fire and thunderbolts, without any reference to solid matter. Mr King likewise quotes the 11th verse of the 10th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> of Joshua.\u2014\"And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to Beth-horon, that the Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hail-stones, than they whom the children of Israel slew with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>.\" Here, the expression, great stones, is less equivocal than coals of fire; yet the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEXT\">context</a> hardly allows us to doubt, that the great stones were really hail-stones, or rather, perhaps, lumps of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a>, consolidated in the atmosphere, such as occasionally fall in hot countries, and such as alarmed the whole of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> and its neighbourhood in 1788. At any rate, the slaughter of the Canaanites is represented as resulting from the special interposition of divine power; and the consideration of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">miracles</a> is irrelevant to our present purpose.\n\nIf from sacred, we turn to the early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of profane <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, we shall find the annals of public events very copiously interspersed with notices of strange appearances, many of which may be safely ascribed to the ascendancy which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> obtained over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> mind. The skepticism of the learned is, however, sometimes not less injudicious and indiscriminate than the credulity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a>; and he who should resolve every extraordinary event, which is recorded by the writers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> and Rome, into a \"cunningly devised <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a>,\" would not be less reprehensible for want of candour, than the untutored rustic, who yields his assent to every alleged miracle, is to be taxed with want of discernment.\n\nAlthough these general positions can scarcely admit of dispute, it becomes extremely difficult, after a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAPSE\">lapse</a> of many ages, and in the collation of marvellous records, to separate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> from falsehood. In our attempts to prosecute this analytical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>, we may sometimes advance a certain length with perfect security, without being able to trace uniformly the precise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> of demarcation. Thus, in regard to the topic of our present discussion, we know, that in various periods of the world the vulgar have ascribed a celestial origin to stones of a peculiar configuration, as to certain modifications of pyrites, to belemnites, orthoceratites, &c., which the subsequent observations of naturalists have proved to be of mineral formation, and to the heads of arrows and sharpened flints, which have been fashioned by the hand of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, and which, accordingly, we are authorized to exclude from the extra-terrestrial catalogue. But when substances dissimilar from these, and coinciding in any one character or circumstance with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> specimens of atmospheric stone, are reported by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> to have fallen from the clouds, the distance of ages and the lameness of the documents may powerfully affect our appreciation of the reputed evidence.\n\nWhen, therefore, we shortly touch on a few of the many instances which might be quoted from the annals of antiquity, we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> not to vouch for the truth even of these particular instances; but merely to admit their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> which the mention of them may be considered to add to that of subsequent and recent narrations.\n\nThrough the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIST\">mist</a> of fable which envelopes the history of the b\u00e6tuli, we discern some characters which correspond with those of meteorites. Thus, in the \u039b\u03cd\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, a poem falsely ascribed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORPHEUS\">Orpheus</a>, the \u03b5\u1f30\u03b4\u03c9\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2, which M. Falconet properly classes with the b\u00e6tuli, is said to be rough, heavy, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>. Damascius, in an extract of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of Ibdorus, preserved by Photius, relates that the b\u00e6tuli fell on Mount Libanus, in a globe of fire. A fragment of Sanchoniathon, preserved in Eusebius, (Pr\u00e6par. Evangel. i. 10.), moreover informs us, that these stones were fabricated by the god <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-URANUS\">Uranus</a> (or Heaven), one of whose four sons was named B\u00e6tulus. May not this mythological genealogy be regarded as merely emblematical of their descent from the upper regions of the atmosphere? In the same chapter we are told that Attarne found a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">star</a> which had fallen from heaven, and honoured it with consecration in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRE\">Tyre</a>. The stone denominated \"the mother of the gods,\" if we can believe Appian, Herodian, and Marcellinus, fell from heaven. Aristodemus, cited by the Greek scholiast on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PINDAR\">Pindar</a>, affirms that it fell encircled by fire, on a hill, at the feet of the Theban bard. It is said to have been of a black <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, and of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> shape. Herodian (lib. v.) expressly declares, that the Phoenicians had no statue of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, polished by the hand; but only a certain stone, circular below, and terminated.\nterminated acutely above, in the form of a cone, of a black colour, and that, according to report, it fell from heaven, and was regarded as the image of the sun.\n\nAmong various instances which might be selected from Livy, is that of a shower of stones on Mount <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBA\">Alba</a>, in the reign of Tullus Hostilius, or about six hundred and fifty-two years before the birth of Christ. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a> were told, that it had rained stones, they doubted the fact, and deputed commissioners to inquire into the particulars. They were then assured, that stones had really fallen, haud alter quam quem grandinem venti glomeratam in terras agunt. On this occasion, the historian mentions, that similar events were celebrated by a festival of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> days. Manjit follemne, ut quando cumque idem prodigium nuntiarent, feriae per novem dies agerentur.\n\nBut one of the most remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> which occurs in the records of antiquity, is that which is mentioned in the 58th chapter of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> book of Pliny's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">Natural</a> History, of a large stone which fell near Egepolotamos, in Thrace, in the second year of the seventy-eighth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OLYMPIAD\">Olympiad</a>, or, according to our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRONOLOGY\">chronology</a>, about four hundred and sixty-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years before the Christian era. Pliny affirms us, that this extraordinary mass was still shewn in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>; and that it was as large as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CART\">cart</a>, and of a burnt colour. The Greeks pretended that it had fallen from the sun, and that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANAXAGORAS\">Anaxagoras</a> had predicted the day of its arrival on the earth's surface. According to Plutarch, in the life of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LYCURGUS\">Lycurgus</a>, the inhabitants of the Chersonesus held the Thracian stone in great veneration, and exhibited it as a public show. His account of its first appearance is chiefly extracted from the relation of Daimachus of Platea, and may be thus translated. \"During seventy-five successive days before the stone fell, a large fiery body, like a cloud of flame, was observed in the heavens, not fixed to one point, but wandering about with a broken, irregular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>. By its violent agitation, several fiery fragments were forced from it, impelled in various directions, and darted with the velocity and brightness of so many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a> stars. After this body had fallen on the Chersonesus, and the people had assembled to examine it, they could find no inflammable matter, nor the slightest trace of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBUSTION\">combustion</a>, but a real stone, which, though large, by no means corresponded to the dimensions of the flaming globe which they had seen in the sky, but seemed to be only a piece detached from it.\" Daimachus, it is true, may, on this occasion, have given way to his reputed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of the marvellous; and we can easily believe that the seventy-five continuous days are either an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> of the copyist, or an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> exaggeration; yet, from the marked coincidence of some of the circumstances with those more fully detailed in the sequel, there arises the presumption that a meteorite really fell at the place and period above assigned.\n\nFrom this period, till near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of the fifteenth century, any historical notices which we have been enabled to collect, are so vague and scanty, that, in this abridged view of the subject, we may pass them over in silence.\n\nProfessor Bantenschoen, of the central school of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLMAR\">Colmar</a>, first directed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of naturalists to some of the old chronicles, which commemorate with much na\u00efvet\u00e9, and in the true spirit of the times, the fall of the celebrated stone of Ensisheim. The following account accompanied this very singular mass, when it was suspended in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>.\n\n\"In the year of the Lord 1492, on Wednesday, which was Martinmas <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVE\">eve</a>, the 7th of November, there happened a singular miracle: for, between eleven o'clock and noon, there was a loud peal of thunder, and a prolonged confused noise, which was heard to a great distance, and a stone fell from the air, in the jurisdiction of Ensisheim, which weighed 260 pounds, and the confused noise was, moreover, much louder than here. There a child <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> it strike on a field, situated in the upper jurisdiction, towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHINE\">Rhine</a> and Inn, near the district of Giffard, which was sown with wheat, and did it no harm, except that it made a hole there; and then they conveyed it from that spot; and many pieces were broken from it, which the landvogt forbade. They, therefore, caused it to be placed in the church, with the intention of suspending it as a miracle; and many people came hither to see this stone. So there were remarkable conversations about this stone; but the learned said, that they knew not what it was; for it was beyond the ordinary course of nature, that such a large mass should unite the earth from the height of the air; but that it was really a miracle of God; for, before that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, never anything was heard like it, nor seen, nor described. When the people found that stone, it had entered into the earth, to the depth of a man's stature, which every body explained to be the will of God, that it should be found, and the noise of it was heard at Lucerne, at Villing, and in many other places, so loud, that it was believed that houses had been overturned: And as the king (Maximilian) was here, the Monday after St Catherine's day, of the same year, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> excellence ordered the stone which had fallen to be brought to the castle, and after having conferred a long time about it with the noblemen, he said the people of Ensisheim should take it, and order it to be hung up in the church, and not allow any body to take anything from it. However, his excellency took two pieces of it, of which he kept one, and sent the other to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> Sigismund of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-AUSTRIA\">Austria</a>; and they spoke a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> about this stone, which they suspended in the choir, where it still is; and a great many people came to see it.\"\n\nTrithemius, in his Hirsauigenian Annals, employs language to this effect.\u2014\"In the same year, on the 7th day of November, in the village of Suntgaw, near the townlet of Ensisheim, not far from Basle, a city of Germany, a stone, called a thunder-stone, of a prodigious size, for we know from eye-witnesses that it weighed 255 pounds, fell from the heavens. Its fall was so violent, that it broke into two pieces. The most considerable is still exhibited at the door of the church of Ensisheim, suspended by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> chain, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the fact which we have mentioned, and to preserve it in the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a>.\"\u2014We learn also from Paul Lang that there arose a furious storm on the 7th of November 1492, and that while the thunder roared, and the heavens appeared all on fire, a stone of enormous size fell near Ensisheim. \"Its form was that of the Greek delta, with a triangular point. They still show it at Ensisheim as an astonishing phenomenon.\"\n\nIt is worthy of observation, that these chroniclers lived at the period which they assign to the descent of\nthe stone; and that, though their names are hastening to oblivion, Tritheimius yielded to few of his contemporaries in labour and learning; while Lang, a German Benedictine as he was, travelled in search of historical monuments, arraigned the licence of the catholic clergy, and applauded the independence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUTHER\">Luther</a> and Melanchthon.\n\nOf the Ensisheim stone, which has been transported to the national library at Colmar, and which, notwithstanding various dilapidations, still weighs 150 pounds, some interesting specimens may now be seen in the cabinets of the curious. Robert Ferguson, Esq., younger of Raith, has, in the most polite and obliging manner, gratified us with the sight of a small fragment, which belongs to his valuable collection of minerals at Raith <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> in Fifehire, Scotland.\n\nWe are fully aware, that M. Barthold has laboured to convince his readers (Journal de Physique, Ventofe, year 8.) that the far-famed mass of Ensisheim is merely argillo-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERRUGINOUS\">ferruginous</a>, of secondary formation, detached from an adjacent mountain, and conveyed to the spot on which it was found by some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORRENT\">torrent</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a>. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, we might partially acquiesce; did not the artificers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> and concurring records militate against it, and had not the more accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> of Vauquelin detected the same constituent parts as in the other stony and metallic substances denominated meteoric. \"It is certainly composed of silica,\" observes this celebrated chemist, \"of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNESIA\">magnesia</a>, of iron, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NICKEL\">nickel</a>, of sulphur, and of a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of lime.\u2014Particular trials have convinced me of the presence of sulphur and nickel in the grains of malleable iron, and in the pyrites, though in different proportions. This stone, then, in every respect, resembles others which have fallen from the atmosphere.\"\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMENTARY\">Commentary</a> of Surius, a Carthusian monk of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOGNE\">Cologne</a>, mention is made of a shower of large stones in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOMBARDY\">Lombardy</a>, in 1510. These stones were harder than flint, and smelled of sulphur. The heaviest weighed 120 pounds.\u2014The same event is more particularly related by Cardan, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> intitled de Rerum Varietate (lib. xiv. c. 72.) According to this author, near the river Adda, not far from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILAN\">Milan</a>, and at five o'clock in the evening, about 1120 stones fell from the air, one of them weighing 120 pounds and another 60 pounds. Many were presented to the French governor, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPUTY\">deputy</a>. At three o'clock P.M. the sky appeared as if in a general blaze; and the passage, though somewhat ambiguous, would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> us to infer, that the meteor was visible for two hours. Like many of the learned and unlearned of his day, Cardan instantly connects the extraordinary appearance with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> transactions of his district.\n\nWe next pass to an interesting extract from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">memoirs</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Jehangire, written in Persian, by himself, and translated by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLONEL\">Colonel</a> Kirkpatrick,\n\n\"A.H. 1030, or 16th year of the reign.\u2014The following is among the extraordinary occurrences of this period.\n\n\"Early on the 30th of Furverdeen of the present year (1629), and in the eastern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of the heavens, there arose in one of the villages of the purgannah of Jalindher, such a great and tremendous noise, as had nearly, by its dreadful nature, deprived the inhabitants of the place of their senses. During this noise, a luminous body was observed to fall from above, on the earth, suggesting to the beholders the idea that the firmament was raining fire. In a short time, the noise having subsided, and the inhabitants having recovered from their alarm, a courier was dispatched to Mahomed Syeed, the amil of the aforefaid purgannah, to advertise him of this event. The amil, instantly mounting his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, proceeded to the spot. Here he perceived the earth, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of a dozen yards in length and breadth, to be burned to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, that not the least trace of verdure, or a blade of grass remained; nor had the heat yet subsided entirely.\n\n\"Mahammed Syeed hereupon directed the aforefaid space of ground to be dug up; when the deeper it was dug, the greater was the heat of it found to be. At length a lump of iron made its appearance, the heat of which was so violent, that one might have supposed it to have been taken from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FURNACE\">furnace</a>. After some time it became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>: when the amil conveyed it to his own habitation, from whence he afterwards dispatched it in a sealed bag to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>.\n\n\"Here I had this substance weighed in my presence. Its weight was 160 tolahs (A). I committed it to a skilful artisan, with orders to make of it a sabre, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>, and a dagger. The workman reported, that the substance was not malleable, but shattered into pieces under the hammer.\n\n\"Upon this I ordered it to be mixed with other iron. Conformably to my orders, three parts of the iron of lightning (B) were mixed with one part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> iron; and from the mixture were made two sabres, one knife, and one dagger.\"\n\nOur limits will not permit us to give the whole of the extract, nor the remarks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">Right</a> Hon. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> Greville and Colonel Kirkpatrick, which were read before the Royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, on the 27th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a>, 1803. We feel, however, no hesitation in attaching to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCUMENT\">document</a> something very nearly approaching to direct evidence of the fact in question.\n\nThe celebrated Gassendi relates, that, on the 27th of November, 1627, about 10 o'clock A.M., during a very clear sky, he saw a flaming stone, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> diameter of four feet, fall on Mount Vaison, an eminence situated between the small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> of Perne and Guillaumes, in Provence. This stone was surrounded by a luminous circle of different colours, nearly resembling the rainbow, and its fall was accompanied with a noise like the discharge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>. It weighed 59 pounds; and its specific gravity was to that of common marble as 14 to 11. It was of a dark metallic colour, and extremely hard. Though it was not subjected to chemical analysis, and is not now to be found, the circumstances which have been stated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> are sufficiently\n\n(A) A tolah is about 180 grains, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TROY_WEIGHT\"><a class=\"x</a>ref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TROY\">Troy</a> weight.\n(B) This expression is equivalent to our term thunder-bolt.\nsufficiently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> to operate on the conviction of those who are willing to be convinced.\n\nFrom a curious book printed at Paris in 1672, and now become very scarce, entitled Conversations tir\u00e9es de l'Acad\u00e9mie de M. l'Abb\u00e9 Bourdelot, contenant diverses recherches et observations physiques, par le Sieur Legallais, we make the ensuing extract.\n\n\"A member presents a fragment of two stones which fell near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERONA\">Verona</a>, one of which weighed 300, and the other 200 pounds. These stones,\" says he, \"fell during the night, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> was perfectly mild and serene. They seemed to be all on fire, and came from above, but in a slanting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, and with a tremendous noise. This prodigy terribly alarmed 300 or 400 eyewitnesses, who were at a loss what to think of it. These stones fell with such rapidity, that they formed a ditch, in which after the noise had ceased, the spectators ventured to approach them, and examine them more closely. They then sent them to Verona, where they were deposited in the Academy, and that learned body sent fragments of them to different places.\"\n\nThat which accompanied the above intimation was of a yellowish hue, very easily pulverized, and smelled of sulphur.\u2014In the course of examining one of these stones, M. Laugier, professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHARMACY\">pharmacy</a> at Paris, has recently detected the presence of chrome, by means of the caustic alkali.\u2014The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATE\">date</a> of the Verona phenomena, if we have been correctly informed, is 1663.\n\nIn the Bornian collection there is a substance which is designated Ferrum retractorium, granulis nitentibus, matrice virescenti immixtis (Ferrum vires Lin.), cujus fragmenta <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">ab</a> unius <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">ad</a> viginti usque librarum pondus, cortice nigro scoriaco circumdata, ad Plann, prope Tabor, circuli Bechinchens Bohemiae, palum reperturunt.\n\nThe following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> is subjoined. (Quae fragmenta 3. Iulii anni 1753, inter tonitrura, e celo pluteo creduliores quidam affluerunt.) The expression creduliores quidam, it may be alleged, at once destroys the evidence of this memorandum. It deserves, however, to be noted, that, in regard to our present subject, what was formerly accounted the credulity of the vulgar, may now, on several occasions, be confirmed into probability, if not into matter of fact; and that Mr Greville has found the identical fragment to have the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> with other meteoric stones. Hence, we are compelled either to admit its extra-terrestrial origin, or the existence of a substance, originally belonging to the earth, and yet agreeing in character with those deemed atmospheric. The former part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALTERNATIVE\">alternative</a> is perfectly consonant with well-authenticated facts; whereas of the latter, we are not warranted to pronounce, that a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> has hitherto been established, to the satisfaction of any chemist or mineralogist.\n\nBut we have now to turn our attention to a report of M. de la Lande, inserted in the Historical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALMANACK\">Almanack</a> of Breffle, for 1756.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of September, 1753, about one o'clock P.M. when the weather was very hot, and very serene, without the least appearance of a cloud, a very loud noise, like the discharge of two or three cannons, was heard within the circumference of six leagues, but was of very short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>. This noise was loudest in the neighbourhood of Pont-de-Velle; and at Liponas, a village three leagues from the last-mentioned place, it was even accompanied with a hissing, like that of a cracker. On the same evening there were found at Liponas and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">Pin</a>, two blackish masses, of a form nearly circular, but very uneven, which had fallen on ploughed ground, and sunk, by their own weight, to half a foot below the surface. One of them weighed about twenty pounds; and a fragment of one of them weighing 114 lb. was preferred in the cabinet of M. Varenne de Beoff, at Dijon. The basis of these masses resembled a grayish whinstone, and was very refractory; and some ferruginous particles were disseminated in grains, filaments, or minute masses, through the substance of the stone, especially in its fissures. This iron, when subjected to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> heat, became obedient to the magnet. The black coating on the surface, M. de la Lande attributes to fusion, induced by violent heat. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>'s acknowledged respectability and accuracy of observation, combined with the circumstances which he has adduced, circumstances, too, which, if mistated, lay so open to public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>, powerfully plead in favour of his testimony.\n\nOn the 15th of September 1760, according to the abb\u00e9 Bachelay, about half past four o'clock P.M. there appeared near the chateau de Chevabrie, in the neighbourhood of Luc\u00e9, a small town of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAINE\">Maine</a>, a stormy cloud, from which proceeded a loud peal of thunder, like the discharge of cannon, and followed by a noise which was mistaken by several people for the lowing of oxen. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> was heard over a space of about two leagues and a half, but unaccompanied by any perceptible flame. The reapers in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> of Perigu\u00e9, about three leagues from Luc\u00e9, on hearing the same noise, looked up, and saw an opaque body, which described a curve, and fell on soft turf, on the high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> from Mons, near which they were at work. They all quickly ran up to it, and found a sort of stone, nearly half of which was buried in the earth, and the whole so hot that it could not be touched. At first they ran away in a panic; but on returning to the spot some time after, they found the stone precisely in the same situation, and sufficiently cooled to admit of being handled, and narrowly examined. It weighed seven ounces and a half, and was of a triangular form, presenting, as it were, three rounded horns, one of which, at the moment of the fall had entered into the ground, and was of a gray or ash colour, while the rest, which was exposed to the air, was very black. When the abb\u00e9 presented this stone to the academy, that body appointed three of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, namely, Messieurs Lavoisier, Fougeroux, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CADET\">Cadet</a>, to examine and analyse it. This task they performed with more care and accuracy than M. de la Lande had done on the preceding occasion; but their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> was confined to an integral part of the whole, considered as a homogeneous substance, in place of being repeated on each of the constituent parts. The substance was of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> cinereous hue, speckled with an infinite number of small and shining metallic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>, visible through a magnifying glass. That part of the outer surface which remained above ground was incrusted with a thin black coating, which seemed to have undergone fusion, and which gave a few sparks when struck with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a>. The specific gravity of the mass was 3.335.\n\n\u2014Two other stones, nearly of the same characters, the one reported to have fallen at Ajre, in Artois, and\nthe other in the Cotentin, in Normandy, were presented to the academy in the course of the same year by M. Gurlon de Boyaval, honorary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a>-general of the bailiwick of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIRE\">Aire</a>, and the younger M. Morand. According to the academical report, these three stones, when compared, presented no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> to the eye, were of the same colour, and nearly of the same grain, exhibiting metallic and pyritous particles, and covered with a black and ferruginous incrustation. Although the coincidence of facts and circumstances, in three places so remote from one another, did not convince the academy that these stones had been conveyed to the earth by lightning, yet it induced them to invite naturalists to prosecute the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the subject.\n\nOn the 20th of November 1768, a stone fell at Mauerkirchen near the Inn, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAVARIA\">Bavaria</a>, that weighed 38lb. was of a triangular form, and only eight inches in thickness. Its fall was accompanied by a hissing noise, and great darkness in the atmosphere. This meteorite penetrated two feet and a half into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>. Part of it is now in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">museum</a> of the right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> Charles Greville, and a fragment may be seen in Mr Ferguson's collection quoted above.\n\nThe next remarkable case on record occurred on the 20th of August 1789, at Barbaton, near Roquefort, in the Landes of Bordeaux, and is thus related by Citizen Lomet, who was known to several members of the institute, and happened to be at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGEN\">Agen</a> when the meteor appeared.\n\n\"It was a very bright fire-ball, luminous as the sun, of the size of an ordinary balloon, and, after inspiring the inhabitants with consternation, burst and disappeared. A few days after, some peasants brought stones, which they said fell from the meteor; but the philosophers to whom they offered them laughed at their assertions as fabulous. The peasants would have now more reason to laugh at the philosophers.\"\u2014One of these stones broke through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> of a cottage, and killed a herdman and some cattle. Vaquelin, who received a process-verbal of the circumstances, also examined one of the specimens. The fragment procured by Mr Ferguson has visibly all the characters of a genuine meteorite.\n\nA much more remarkable phenomenon, however, of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>, occurred near Agen, on the 24th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 1790. An inhabitant of St Severe communicates the following particulars to M. Darcey the chemist, who was then resident at Paris.\n\n\"Our towns-people were yesterday very much alarmed. About a quarter past nine o'clock, in the evening, there suddenly appeared in the air a fire-ball, dragging a long train, which diffused a very vivid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> over the horizon. This meteor soon disappeared, and seemed to fall at one hundred paces from us. It was quickly followed by an explosion louder than that of cannon or of thunder. Every body dreaded being buried under the ruins of his house, which seemed to give way from the concussion. The same phenomenon was seen, and the report heard, in the neighbouring towns, as Mont de Marfan, Tartas, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAX\">Dax</a>. The weather in other respects was very calm, without a breath of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> or a cloud, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> shone in all her brightness.\"\n\nM. Darcey's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, a clergyman in that part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, sent him a small stone, which was picked up on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> after the explosion, and the history of which he was scrupulously anxious to investigate. Being satisfied with respect to all the particulars, he at length dispatched it to Paris, accompanied with some curious remarks. \"When these stones fell,\" says he, \"they had not their present degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a>. Some of them fell on straw, bits of which stuck to the stones, and incorporated with them. I have seen one in this predicament. It is at present at la Battele; but I cannot persuade the owner to part with it.\" Thole which fell on the houses produced a noise, not like that of stones, but rather of a substance which had not yet acquired compactness.\"\n\nWe subjoin the process-verbal\u2014a simple but authentic document.\n\n\"In the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety, and the 30th day of the month of August, we, the Sieur Jean Duby, mayor, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> Maulion, procurator of the commune of the municipality of La Grange de Juillac, and Jean Darmite, resident in the parish of La Grange de Juillac, certify in truth and verity, that, on Saturday the 24th of July last, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, there passed a great fire, and after it we heard in the air a very loud and extraordinary noise; and, about two minutes after, there fell stones from heaven, but fortunately there fell only a very few, and they fell about ten paces from one another in some places, and in others nearer, and finally, in some other places, farther, and falling, most of them, of the weight of about half a quarter of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> each; some of about half a pound, like that found in our parish of La Grange; and on the borders of the parish of Creon, they were found of a pound weight; and in falling they seemed not to be inflamed, but very hard and black without, and within of the colour of steel; and, thank God, they occasioned no harm to the people, nor the trees, but only to some trees which were broken on the houses; and most of them fell gently, and others fell quickly, with a hissing noise; and some were found which had entered into the earth, but very few. In witness whereof we have written and signed these presents.\n\n(Signed) Duby, Mayor\u2014Darmite.\"\n\nMonseigneur Baudin mentions, that, as M. Carris of Barbotan and he were walking in the court of the castle of Mormes about half past nine o'clock, in the evening of the 24th of July 1790, when the air was perfectly calm, and the sky cloudless, they found themselves suddenly surrounded by a pale clear light, which obscured that of the moon, though the latter was nearly full. On <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> up, they observed, almost in their zenith, a fireball of a larger apparent diameter than that of the moon, dragging a tail, which seemed to be five or six times longer than the diameter of its body, and which gradually tapered to a point, the latter approaching to blood-red, though the rest of the meteor was of a pale <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>. This luminous body proceeded with great velocity from south to north, and in two seconds split into portions of considerable size, like the fragment of a bursting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOMB\">bomb</a>. These fragments became extinguished in the air, and some of them, as they fell, assumed that deep red colour, which had been observed at the point of the tail. Two or three minutes after M. Baudin and his friend heard a dreadful explosion, like the simultaneous firing of several pieces of ordnance; but they were not sensible of any tremulous motion under their feet, though the concus-\nMeteorite.\n\nThe phenomenon of the atmosphere shook the windows in their frames, and threw down <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KITCHEN\">kitchen</a> utensils from their shelves. When these gentlemen removed to the garden, the noise still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, and seemed to be directly over their heads. Some time after it had ceased, they heard a hollow sound rolling in echoes, for fifty miles, along the chain of the Pyrenees, and at the end of about four minutes gradually dying away in distance. At the same time, a strong sulphurous odour was diffused in the atmosphere. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> which occurred between the disruption of the meteor, and the loud report, induced M. Baudin to conjecture, that this fireball must have been at least eight miles from the earth's surface, and that it fell about four miles from Mormes. \"The latter part of my conjecture, lays he, was soon confirmed by an account which we received of a great many stones having fallen from the atmosphere at Juillac and in the neighbourhood of Barbotan.\" It appears, indeed, from the concurring testimony of intelligent persons worthy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>, that the meteor really exploded at a little distance from Juillac, and that its fragments were found lying in an almost circular space, of nearly two miles in diameter. Some of them weighed eighteen or twenty, and a few, it is alleged, even fifty pounds. M. de Carris procured one of 18 lbs. which he transmitted to the Parisian Academy of Sciences. That examined by M. Baudin was small, but heavy in proportion to its size, black on the outside, grayish within, and intermixed with many minute, thinning, metallic particles. These last circumstances perfectly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCORD\">accord</a> with the fragment of a Barbotan stone preserved in Mr Ferguson's collection.\n\nIn one of his letters to Professor St Amand, M. Goyon d'Arzaz remarks, that these stones, though generally smooth on the outside, presented some longitudinal cracks, or fissures, while their interior parts exhibited symptoms of metallic veins, especially of a ferruginous-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a>. When yet red-hot, and scattered in various directions, they formed that magnificent firework, that shower of flame, which enlightened the horizon over a large tract of country; for this extraordinary meteor was seen at Bayonne, Auch, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAU\">Pau</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TARBES\">Tarbes</a>, and even at Bordeaux and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOULOUSE\">Toulouse</a>. At the last mentioned place it excited little attention, on account of its great distance, and its appearing only a little brighter than a shooting star. It, moreover, deserves to be noted, that the meteorites in question were found on a bare moor, of an extremely thin soil, on which no such stones, or indeed stones of any description, had been observed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of man. They who are solicitous of additional information on this part of our subject, may consult Nos. 23 and 24 of the Journal des Sciences Utiles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTPELLIER\">Montpellier</a>, for 1790, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECADE\">Decade</a> Philosophique for February 1796.\n\nWhen all the circumstances of the case are duly considered, we need not be surprised, that they should produce conviction on the minds of many men of science, who, till then, persisted \"an evil heart of unbelief.\" M. de St Amand ingenuously confessed to M. Pi\u00e9let of Geneva, that he had treated this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVEL\">novel</a> topic with unmerited contempt, and that the evidence deduced from the similar characters of the stones should not be rashly rejected. The learned and the unlearned of the district in which the phenomenon is stated to have occurred, attest its existence; the professor of natural history in the central school of Agen renounces his former scepticism; Vauquelin analyses a specimen, and finds it to contain the same chemical substances as other meteorites, and in nearly the same proportions; and shall we be so unreasonable as to withhold our assent, merely because we have not ocular demonstration of the alleged particulars?\n\nOur chronological <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of cases has now brought us to the fall of several meteorites near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIENNA\">Sienna</a>, the particulars of which, as reported by the late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRISTOL\">Bristol</a> and Sir William <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a>, are recorded in the first part of the Philosophical Transactions for 1795 (page 103). Mr King, likewise in the tract which we have already quoted, communicates some interesting circumstances relative to this phenomenon, chiefly extracted from an account of it published by Professor Soldani. While we refer our readers to these details, we cannot omit mentioning that, in regard to aspect and composition, the Sienna stones are perfectly analogous to others already noticed, and very different from any that occur in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUSCANY\">Tuscany</a>. As the meteor from which they were discharged appeared on the morning after a violent eruption of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VESUVIUS\">Vesuvius</a>, they were at first supposed to be volcanic, till cool reflection and examination betrayed the extravagance of such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>. The precise number of stones which were collected on this occasion is not specified, but many of them were small, weighing from a quarter of an ounce to two ounces. A pretty entire specimen occurs in Mr Ferguson's collection.\u2014The date of the Sienna meteor is the 16th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>, 1794.\n\nOn the 13th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> of the following year, about three o'clock in the afternoon, another of these singular stones, weighing 56 pounds, fell near the country house of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Topham, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a>. The captain's report, which is inserted in the Gentleman's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a> for 1796, is distinct and satisfactory; while the chemical examination of the mass, detailed in Mr Howard's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1802, affords a still more decisive proof of its atmospheric origin. M. de Dr\u00e9e, also, found it to correspond exactly in aspect and character, with fragments of meteor stones from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENARES\">Benares</a> and Ville-franche. The original mass is in the possession of Mr Sowerby author of English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">Botany</a>, &c. It is larger than a man's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>.\n\nMr Southey, in his letters from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a>, transcribes the authenticated relation of another instance of the descent of a stone from the clouds on the 19th of February 1796. But we pass to some of the most important details relative to the stone which is affirmed to have fallen near Ville-franche, in the department of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RHONE\">Rhone</a>, on the 12th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>, 1798. When it was transmitted to Professor Sage, member of the National Institute, he considered it at first, as only a pyritous and magnetic ore of iron, although it bore no resemblance to any known <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of ore of that metal, since it contained nickel, silica, magnesia, and native iron, which shone like steel when polished. \"It is of an ash gray colour,\" says M. Sage, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANULATED\">granulated</a> and speckled with gray, thinning, and pyritous metallic points. One of its surfaces is covered with a dingy-black enamel, about the third of a line in thickness. This stone acts very powerfully on the magnetic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a>. When the senator Chaffet transmitted it to me, it...\nwas accompanied by an historical notice of similar import with that which M. Delivre, of Ville-franche, who saw and described the phenomenon on the spot.\n\nAt six o'clock in the evening, a round body, which diffused the most vivid light, was observed in the vicinity of Ville-franche, moving westward, and producing a hissing, like that of a bomb which traverses the air. This luminous body, which was seen at the same time at Lyons and on Mont-Cenis, marked its path by a red track of fire, and exploded, about 200 toises from the earth, with a tremendous report and concussion. One of the flaming fragments fell on the vineyard of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> Crepier, an inhabitant of Sales. On the spot where this portion of the meteor was seen to fall, and in a fresh opening of about 20 inches in depth, and 18 in width, was found a black mass, 15 inches in diameter, and rounded on one side.\n\nAn account of the same meteor was published in the Journal de Physique, for Floreal, year 11, by M. de Dr\u00e9e. From his minute and deliberate investigation, it appears that the fire-ball had scarcely fixed the attention of the inhabitants of the Sales and of the adjacent villages, when its rapid approach, accompanied by a terrible whizzing noise, like that of an irregular hollow body, traversing the air with unusual velocity, inspired the whole commune with alarm, especially when they observed it passing over their heads, at an inconsiderable elevation. It left behind a long train of light, and emitted, with an almost unceasing crackling, small vivid flames, like little stars. Its fall was remarked, at the distance of only 50 paces, by three labourers, one of whom, named Montillard, let fall his coat and bundle of sticks that he might run the faster, while the other two, Chardon and Lapoec, fled with equal precipitation to Sales, where the alarm had become general.\u2014These three witnesses attest the astonishing rapidity of the meteor's motion, and the hissing which proceeded from the spot where it fell. So terrified was Crepier at the explosion, that he locked himself up with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, first in his cellar, and then in his private apartment, not venturing abroad till next morning, when, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of M. Blandel, Chardon, Lapoec, and many others, he repaired to the opening which had been made by the fire-ball. At the bottom of this opening, which was 18 inches deep, including the entire thickness of the mould, they found a large black mass, of an irregularly oval form, having a fanciful resemblance to a calf's head. Though no longer hot, it smelled of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUN\">gun</a>-powder and was cracked in several places. When the observers broke it, and discovered nothing but stone, indifference succeeded to curiosity, and they coolly ascribed its appearance to causes more or less whimsical and supernatural.\n\nThe original weight of this stone was about twenty pounds. Its black vitrified surface gave fire with steel. Its interior was hard, earthy, ash-coloured, of a granular texture, presenting different substances scattered through it, namely, iron in grains, from the smallest size to a line or even more in diameter, somewhat malleable, but harder and whiter than forged iron; white pyrites, both lamellated and granular, and in colour approaching to nickel; some gray globules, which seemed to present the characters of trapp, and a very few and small particles of steatite, inclining to an olive hue. On account of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HETEROGENEOUS\">heterogeneous</a> composition, its specific gravity could not be easily ascertained. One hundred parts of the mass gave, according to Vauquelin, 46 of silica, 38 oxide of iron, 15 magnesia, 2 nickel, and 2 lime. The excess of this result was ascribed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a> of oxygen by the native iron during the process. A small specimen of this mass belongs to Mr Fergulon's collection.\n\nOn the 19th of December 1798, about eight o'clock in the evening, the inhabitants of Benares and its neighbourhood observed in the heavens a very luminous meteor, in the form of a large ball of fire, which exploded with a loud noise, and from which a number of stones were precipitated near Krakhtu, a village about fourteen miles from the city of Benares. Mr Davis, the judge and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a> of the district, affirmed that its brilliancy equalled the brightest moonlight. Both he and Mr Enskine, the assistant collector, were induced to send persons in whom they could confide to the spot where this shower of stones was asserted to have taken place, and thus obtained additional evidence of the phenomenon, and several of the stones, which had penetrated about six inches into fields recently watered. Mr Maclean, a gentleman who resided near Krakhtu, presented Mr Howard with part of a stone, which had been brought to him the morning after its descent, by the watchman who was on duty at his house, and through the roof of whose hut it had passed, and buried itself several inches in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a>, which was of consolidated earth. Before it was broken, it must have weighed upwards of two pounds.\n\nAt the time that this meteor appeared, the sky was perfectly serene; not the slightest vestige of a cloud had been seen since the 11th of the month, nor was any observed for many days after.\n\n\"Of these stones (says Mr Howard,) I have seen eight nearly perfect, besides parts of several others, which had been broken by the possessors, to distribute among their friends. The form of the more perfect ones appeared to be that of an irregular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a>, rounded off at the edges; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> were to be observed on most of them. They were of various sizes, from about three to upwards of four inches in their largest diameter; one of them, measuring four inches and a quarter, weighed two pounds twelve ounces. In appearance they were exactly similar; externally they were covered with a hard black coat, or incrustation, which in some parts had the appearance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VARNISH\">varnish</a> or bitumen; and on most of them were fractures, which, from their being covered with a matter similar to that of the coat, seemed to have been made in the fall, by the stones striking against each other, and to have passed through some medium, probably an intense heat, previous to their reaching the earth. Internally they consisted of a number of small spherical bodies, of a slate colour, imbedded in a whitish gritty substance, interspersed with bright shining speckles, of a metallic or pyritical nature. The spherical bodies were much harder than the rest of the stone: the white gritty part readily crumbled, on being rubbed with a hard body; and, on being broken, a quantity attached itself to the magnet, but more particularly the outside coat or crust, which appeared almost wholly attachable by it.\"\n\nHere we are furnished with another circumstantial and authenticated narrative, by individuals above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>\nrank of suspicion, and who were prompted solely by motives of curiosity, to examine with due deliberation the particulars which they have reported.\n\nThe history of the extraordinary shower of stones which fell near l'<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIGLE\">Aigle</a>, in Normandy, on the 26th of April 1803, first appeared in the ensuing letters <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>, addressed by M. Marais, an inhabitant of the place, to his friend in Paris.\n\n\"At l'Aigle, the 13th Flor\u00e9al, year II.\n\n\"An astonishing miracle has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> occurred in our district. Here it is, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a>, addition, or diminution. It is certain, that it is the truth itself.\n\n\"On Friday last, 6th Flor\u00e9al (26th April), between one and two o'clock in the afternoon, we were roused by a murmuring noise like thunder. On going out we were surprised to see the sky pretty clear, with the exception of some small clouds. We took it for the noise of a carriage, or of fire in the neighbourhood. We were then in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEADOW\">meadow</a>, to examine whence the noise proceeded, when we observed all the inhabitants of the Pont de Pierre at their windows, and in gardens, inquiring concerning a cloud, which passed in the direction of from south to north, and from which the noise issued, although that cloud presented nothing extraordinary in its appearance. But great was our astonishment when we learned, that many and large stones had fallen from it, some of them weighing ten, eleven, and even seventeen pounds, in the space between the house of the Buat family (half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> to the north-north-east of l'Aigle) and Glos, passing by St Nicolas, St Pierre, &c., which struck us at first as a fable, but which was afterwards found to be true.\n\n\"The following is the explanation given of this extraordinary event by all who witnessed it.\n\n\"They heard a noise like that of a cannon, then a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> report still louder than the preceding, followed by a rumbling noise, which lasted about ten minutes, the same which we also heard, accompanied with hiftings, caused by these stones, which were counteracted in their fall by the different currents of air, which is very natural in the case of such a sudden expansion. Nothing more was heard; but it is remarkable, that previously to the explosion, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> fowls were alarmed, and the cows bellowed in an unusual manner.\n\nAll the country-folks were much dismayed, especially the women, who believed that the end of the world was at hand. A labourer at la Sapee fell prostrate on the ground, exclaiming, 'Good God! is it possible that thou canst make me perish thus? <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARDON\">Pardon</a>, I beseech thee, all the faults I have committed,' &c. The most trifling objects, in fact, might create alarm, for it is not improbable, that history offers no example of such a shower of stones as this. The piece which I find was detached from a large one, weighing eleven pounds, which was found between the house of the Buaus and le Fertey. It is said, that a collector of curiosities purchased one of seventeen pounds weight, that he might send it to Paris. Every body in this part of the country is deafened of possessing a whole stone, or a fragment of one, as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of curiosity. The largest were darted with such violence that they entered at least a foot into the earth. They are black on the outside, and grayish, as you see, within, seeming to contain some species of metal and nitre. If you know before us of what ingredients they are composed, you will inform us. One fell near M. Bois de la Ville, who lives near Glos. He was much afraid, and took shelter under a tree. He has found a great number of them of different sizes, in his court-yard, his wheat fields, &c., without reckoning all those which the peasants have found elsewhere. Numberless stories, more or less absurd, have been circulated among the people. You know that our country is fertile in such tales. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUSIN\">Cousin</a> Moutardier sends one of these stones to Mademoiselle H\u00e9bert; and he is not less eager than we are, to know how these substances can be compressed and petrified in the air. Do try to explain the process.\n\n\"The person who gave me the largest stone which I send to you, went to take it at the moment that it fell, but it was so hot that it burned him. Several of his neighbours shared the same fate in attempting to lift it.\n\n\"The elder Buat has just arrived, and desires us to add, that a fire-ball was observed to hover over the meadow. Perhaps it was wild-fire.\"\n\nAt the sitting of the institute, on the 9th of May, Fourcroy read a letter, addressed from l'Aigle to Vauquelin, and which sufficiently corroborates the preceding statements. But we pass to the substance of M. Biot's letter, addressed to the minister of the interior, and published in the Journal des D\u00e9bats, (14th Thermidor, year II.). The writer, who is advantageously known for his scientific attainments, was deputed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> to repair to the spot, and collect all the authentic facts. The contents of his letter have been since expanded into the form of a memoir, which manifests the caution and good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> which guided his inquiries, and which, we are surprised to learn, has not appeared in an English translation.\n\nM. Biot left Paris on the 25th of June, and in place of proceeding directly to l'Aigle, went first to Alen\u00e7on, which lies fifteen leagues to the west-south-west of it. He was informed on his way, that a globe of fire had been observed moving towards the north, and that its appearance was followed by a violent explosion. From Alen\u00e7on he journeyed through various villages to l'Aigle, being directed in his progress by the accounts of the inhabitants, who had all heard the explosion on the day and at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> specified. Almost all the inhabitants of twenty hamlets, scattered over an extent of upwards of two leagues <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> affirmed that they were eye-witnesses of a dreadful shower of stones which was darted from the meteor. The following is his summary of the whole evidence.\n\n\"On Tuesday, 6th Flor\u00e9al, year II., about one o'clock, P.M. the weather being serene, there was observed from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAEN\">Caen</a>, Pont d'Audemer, and the environs of Alen\u00e7on, Falaise, and Verneuil, a fiery globe, of a very brilliant splendor, and which moved in the atmosphere with great rapidity. Some moments after, there was heard at l'Aigle, and in the environs of that town, in the extent of more than thirty leagues in every direction, a violent explosion, which lasted five or six minutes. At first there were three or four reports, like those of cannon, followed by a kind of discharge which resembled the firing of musketry; after which there was heard a dreadful rumbling like\nthe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEATING\">beating</a> of a drum. The air was calm, and the sky serene, except a few clouds, such as are frequently observed.\n\n\"This noise proceeded from a small cloud which had a rectangular form, the largest side being in a direction from east to west. It appeared motionless all the time that the phenomenon lasted; but the vapors of which it was composed, were projected momentarily from different sides, by the effect of the successive explosions. This cloud was about half a league to the north-north-west of the town of l'Aigle. It was at a great elevation in the atmosphere, for the inhabitants of two hamlets, a league distant from each other, saw it at the same time above their heads. In the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTON\">canton</a> over which this cloud was suspended, there was heard a hissing noise like that of a stone discharged from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SLING\">sling</a>, and a great many mineral masses exactly similar to those distinguished by the name of meteorites were seen to fall.\n\n\"The district in which these masses were projected, forms an elliptical extent of about two leagues and a half in length, and nearly one in breadth, the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMENSION\">dimension</a> being in a direction from south-east to north-west, forming a declination of about 22 degrees. This direction, which the meteor must have followed, is exactly that of the magnetic meridian, which is a remarkable result. The greatest of these stones fell at the south-eastern extremity of the large axis of the ellipse, the middle-sized in the centre, and the smaller at the other extremity. Hence it appears that the largest fell first, as might naturally be supposed. The largest of all those that fell weighs seventeen pounds and a half. The smallest which I have seen weighs about two gros (a thousandth part of the last). The number of all those which fell is certainly above two or three thousand.\"\n\nAs we cannot make room for an analysis of M. Biot's more extended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a>, we shall be contented to select only two facts.\n\nThe cur\u00e9 of St Michael declared, that he observed one of the stones fall, with a hissing noise, at the feet of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIECE\">niece</a>, in the court yard of his parsonage, and that it rebounded upwards of a foot from the pavement. He instantly requested his niece to fetch it to him; but as she was too much alarmed, a woman who happened also to be on the spot, took it up; and it was found in every respect to resemble the others.\n\nAs one Piche, a wire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANUFACTURER\">manufacturer</a> belonging to the village of Arm\u00e9es, was working with his men in the open air, a stone grazed his arm, and fell at his feet; but it was so hot, that, on attempting to take it up, he instantly let it fall again.\n\nHe who compares the various accounts of the l'Aigle meteor, with a critical eye, may detect some apparent contradictions, which, however, on reflection, are found to be strictly conformable to truth. Thus, according to some, the meteor had a rapid motion, others believed it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a>; some saw a very luminous ball of fire, others only an ordinary cloud. Spectators, in fact, viewed it in different positions with respect to its direction. They who happened to be in its line of march, would see it stationary, for the same reason, that we fancy a ship under full sail to be motionless, when we are placed in its wake, or when we view it from the harbour to which it is approaching in a straight line.\n\nThey, on the other hand, who had a side view of the meteor, would reckon its progress the more rapid, in proportion as their position approached to a right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> with its line of passage. They, again, who saw it from behind, as the inhabitants of l'Aigle, would perceive only the cloud of vapour, which it left in its train, and which, in the dark, would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> like a blazing tail, in the same manner as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> of a volcano appears black during the day and red at night. Lastly, they who were placed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of the meteor, would reckon it stationary, but brilliant and cloudless.\n\nIt deserves to be remarked, that the l'Aigle stones were very friable for some days after their descent, that they gradually acquired hardness, and that after they had lost the sulphurous odour on their surface, they still retained it in their substances, as was found by breaking them. Professor Sage submitted them to several comparative trials with those of Ville-franche; and, though the l'Aigle specimens present some globules of the size of a small coriander seed, of a darker gray than the mats, and not attractable by the magnet, yet, in respect of granular texture and general aspect, the coincidence was so striking as to lead one to suppose that they were all parts of the same mats.\n\nThe l'Aigle stones, according to Fourcroy, are generally irregular, polygonal, often cuboid, sometimes subcuneiform, and exceedingly various in their diameter and weight. All are covered with a black gravelly crust, consisting of a fused matter, and filled with small agglutinated grains of iron. The greater part of them are broken at the corners, either by their shock against each other, or by falling on hard bodies. The internal parts resemble those of all the stones analyzed by Messrs. Howard and Vauquelin, being gray, a little varied in their shades, granulated, and as it were fleshy, split in many parts, and filled with brilliant metallic points, exactly of the same aspect as those of other stones of a like description. The proportions of their constituent materials are stated as nearly, 54 siliceous, 36 oxidated iron, 9 magnesia, 3 nickel, 2 sulphur, and 1 lime, the five per cent. of increase arising from the oxidation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a> produced by the analysis.\n\nOf the two specimens which M. Biot presented to the celebrated Patrin, one was less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a>, and of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> gray than the other, and likewise presented small patches of a rusty colour. When immersed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, it gave a hissing sound, like the humming of a fly, which is held by one wing. As it began to dry, it was observed to be marked by curvilinear and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> layers. The more compact specimens, when moistened, presented no such appearances, but assumed the aspect of a gray porphyry, with a base of trap, mottled with small white spots, and speckled with metallic points.\n\nTwo fine specimens of the l'Aigle stone, one of them nearly entire, may be seen in Mr. Ferguson's collection, which we have already repeatedly quoted.\n\nPreviously to the explosion of the 26th of April 1803, no meteorites had been found by the inhabitants of the l'Aigle district, nor in the mineralogical collections of the department; nor the slightest mention of them made in the geological documents of this portion of Normandy: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a>, foundries, and forges, had produced nothing similar, in the form of dross or ore, nor had the country exhibited any trace of volcanoes.\nThe meteor at once appears, and a multitude of stones of the peculiar character noted above are seen scattered on a determined space of ground, in a manner, and accompanied with circumstances, which could not formerly have escaped observation. Let us likewise reflect, that the young and the old, simple peasants dwelling at a distance from one another, sagacious and rational workmen, respectable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICS\">ecclesiastics</a>, young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> devoid of timidity, individuals, in short, of various manners, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFESSIONS\">professions</a>, and opinions, united by no common ties, all agree in attesting a fact, which contributed neither directly nor indirectly to promote their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, and they all assign the manifestation of this fact to the same day and hour. They, moreover, point to existing vestiges of the descent of solid substances, and they declare, in terms unsusceptible of misconception or ambiguity, that they saw the masses in question roll down on roofs, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> branches of trees, rebound from the pavement, and produce smoke where they fell. These recitals, and these vestiges, are limited to a tract of territory which has been accurately defined; while beyond the precincts of this tract, not a single particle of a meteorite has been found, nor a single individual who pretends that he saw stone fall.\n\nHaving now, we presume, advanced ample and satisfactory evidence of the existence of meteorites, we shall forbear to enlarge this article by dwelling on instances of inferior notoriety to those which we have recounted, and shall merely note the dates of subsequent examples.\n\nOn the 4th of July 1803, a fire-ball struck the White Bull Inn at East-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTON\">Norton</a>, and left behind it several meteoric fragments.\u2014On the 13th of December of the same year, a similar phenomenon occurred at the village of St Nicholas, in Bavaria.\u2014At Poffil, near Glasgow in Scotland, a meteor-stone fell, with a loud and hissing noise, on the 5th April 1804.\u2014The next instance which we have to mention occurred near Apt, in the department of Vaucluse, on the 6th of October of the same year; and the last which has come to our knowledge happened at half past five o'clock, in the evening of the 15th March 1806, near Aigues in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUEDOC\">Languedoc</a>.\n\nIt seems reasonable, however, to suppose, that the fall of meteoric substances takes place more frequently than is commonly supposed, since several foreign collections of fossils contain specimens of reputed celestial origin, and exhibiting the genuine atmospheric physiognomy. It is likewise worthy of remark, that many relations of the phenomenon may have sunk into oblivion, from the contempt with which they were heard by the learned, and that, on a fair computation of chances, meteors may have sometimes exploded on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> tracts of land, and still more frequently over the pathless expanse of the waters.\n\nThat some of the relations to which we have alluded are vague and unsatisfactory, cannot be denied, but the circumstantial testimony conveyed by others is more pointed and positive; and the whole mass of historical proof, especially when combined with the argument deduced from the identity of the physical and chemical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of the stones, appears to us to be altogether irresistible.\n\nIn the course of our inquiry into this novel and interesting subject, we have ascertained a variety of circumstances which render it highly probable, if not indubitable, that those detached masses of native iron, whose history has so often staggered and perplexed the geologist, are only modifications of meteoric depositions. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARTARS\">Tartars</a>, for example, ascribe the descent of the Siberian mass described by Chladni, Pallas, Patrin, &c., to a period that is lost in the remoteness of antiquity; and while <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a> thus favours our hypothesis, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> which is obviously observable in point of texture and chemical characters with those of other solid bodies, whose fall is no longer questioned, strengthens tradition. According to the discoveries of Proult and Klaproth, native iron, reputed meteoric, differs from that which occurs in a fossil state by the presence of nickel. The former of these celebrated analysts obtained 50 grains of sulphate of nickel from 100 of the South American mass, and his results are corroborated by Mr Howard and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> de Bournon.\n\nOf the two pieces of Siberian iron possessed by Mr Greville, one, which was transmitted by Dr Pallas, weighs several pounds; and another presents a cellular and ramified texture, analogous to that of some very light and porous volcanic scoriae. When attentively examined, there may be perceived in it not only empty cells, but also impressions or cavities of greater or less depth, and in some of which there remains a transparent substance, of a yellowish green colour. The iron itself is very malleable; and may be easily cut with a knife, or flattened under the hammer. The specific gravity is 6.487, which is obviously inferior to that of unforged iron that has undergone fusion, and may be partly owing to the oxidization of the surface of the iron, and partly to the many minute cavities in its substance, which are often rendered visible by fracture, and which have their surface also oxidized. The fracture is shining and silvery, like that of white cast iron; but its grain is much smoother and finer; and it is much more malleable when cold. The heavier specimen is more solid and compact, exhibiting no cavities or pores, though its surface is ramified and cellular. So blended and incorporated is its compact part with the yellowish-green substance mentioned above, that if the whole of the latter could be subtracted, the remainder would consist of iron in the metallic state, and would display the same cellular appearance as the preceding specimen, or as the superficial portion of that now described. This stony part of the composition usually assumes the appearance of small nodules, generally of an irregular shape, but sometimes nearly globular, with a smooth, shining, and glassy surface. This substance, which is always more or less transparent, is hard enough to cut glass, but makes no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTZ\">quartz</a>. It becomes electric by friction, is very refractory, and varies in specific gravity from 3.263 to 3.300. Of all substances hitherto known, it approaches most to the peridot, or Wernerian chrysoelite, which yielded to Klaproth nearly the same results which this substance did to Howard. In the mass of iron, it is liable to decomposition, changing to an opaque white, and crumbling into a gritty dry powder, when lightly pressed or squeezed between the fingers.\u2014\"I cannot help observing (says the count de Bournon), that there appears to exist a very interesting analogy between these transparent nodules and the globules I described as making part of the stones said...\"\nto have fallen on the earth. This analogy, though not a very strong one, may lead us to suppose, that the two substances are similar in their nature, but that the globules are less pure, and contain a greater quantity of iron.\"\n\nThe native iron from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOHEMIA\">Bohemia</a> is compact, like the large specimen from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a>, in Mr Greville's collection, and like it contains nodules, but not so numerous. They are besides quite opake, and very much resemble the globules in atmospheric stones. This iron contains nearly five per cent. of nickel. Between five and six per cent. of the same metal seems to exist in a piece of native iron brought from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENEGAL\">Senegal</a>.\n\nThough our limits will not permit us to dwell with minuteness on the physical and chemical characters of meteorites, we shall shortly state those which the count de Bourmont found to appertain to the specimens from Benares, and which may serve as no unfair standard of the aspect and composition of the others.\n\nLike all of the same origin which were subjected to the count's examination, the Benares stones are covered over the whole extent of their surface, with a thin crust, of a deep black colour, sprinkled over with small apertures, which make it feel somewhat like flaxseed or silt skin. Their fracture exhibits a grayish ash colour, and a granulated texture, like that of coarse grit-stone. By help of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENS\">lens</a>, they are perceived to be composed of four different substances. One of these occurs in great abundance, in the form of small bodies, some of which are perfectly globular, others rather elongated or elliptical, and all of various sizes, from that of a small pin's head to that of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEA\">pea</a>, or nearly so. These small globules are usually gray, sometimes inclining much to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>, and always opake; they are easily broken in any direction, have a conchoidal fracture, and a fine, smooth, compact grain, with a slight degree of lustre, approaching to enamel; lastly, they can destroy the polish of glass without being able to cut it, and sparkle faintly when struck with steel. Another of these substances is martial pyrites, of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDETERMINATE\">indeterminate</a> form, and reddish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> colour, slightly verging to the nickel tint, or to that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> pyrites; of a somewhat loosely granulated texture, and irregularly distinguished in the mass, being black when reduced to powder, and not attractible by the magnet. The third of these substances consists of small particles of iron, in a perfectly metallic state, so that they may be easily flattened or extended under the hammer. Though in a much smaller proportion than the pyrites just mentioned, they impart the magnetic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> to the stone. When a piece of the latter was pulverized, and the particles of iron separated from it as accurately as possible, by means of a magnet, they appeared to compose about 200 parts of the weight of the stone. These three substances are united by means of a fourth, which is nearly of an earthly consistency, and of a whitish gray colour.\u2014The black crust, or outward coating, though of very inconsiderable thickness, emits bright sparks when struck with steel, may be broken by the hammer, and seems to possess the same properties with the black oxide of iron, though, like the substance of the stone, it is occasionally intermixed with small particles of iron in the metallic state. These are easily distinguished, by passing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FILE\">file</a> over the crust, which reveals their lustre. The specific gravity of the Benares stones is 3.52.\n\nNone of them, when breathed on, emit the argillaceous meteorite odour.\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of various experiments, M. Sage infers that meteorites are composed of native iron, sulphuret of nickel, quartz or silica, alumina, and magnesia; that the proportions of iron and nickel vary; that the quartz seems to form at least the half of the stone, the alumina and magnesia the fifth, and the sulphur the 30th part. These general results pretty nearly accord with the more special reports of Howard and Vauquelin, except that the latter makes no mention of alumina, the existence of which in atmospheric stones is by no means distinctly ascertained.\n\nWe shall only beg leave to add, on this part of our subject, that Laugier, an ingenious chemist, by employing the caustic alkali, has detected a small portion of chrome. The results of his experiments, which are stated in the 58th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Annales de Chimie, are:\n\n1st. That the five stones from Verona, Barbotan, Ensillicium, l'Aigle, and the neighbourhood of Apt, besides the principles already recognized, contain about one per cent. of chrome.\n\n2dly. That it is very probable, that all meteorites contain this principle, since they all resemble one another in their physical and chemical properties, and have all, apparently, the same origin;\n\nand, 3dly. That in many cases, the perfection of chemical analysis requires, that the same substance should be treated both by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALKALIES\">alkalies</a>, since <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> has shown, that a principle which eluded the former method, has been revealed by the latter.\n\nHaving now, as we apprehend, sufficiently established the existence and nature of meteorites, we hope our readers will excuse us from enlarging on the various causes which have been assigned for their origin, as these seem to lie beyond the reach of our present state of knowledge. After a candid and patient review of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> theories, we conceive that they are at best gratuitous, and that most of them are open to many and formidable objections.\n\nThe terrestrial hypotheses, we believe, begin already to be generally abandoned, as untenable. Until the phenomenon of exploding meteors had been distinctly observed and recorded, Lenoir and others could maintain, with some degree of plausibility, that lightning might tear up the ground, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> soil into a compact mass. But the appearances of a thunder storm and of a fire-ball are now ascertained to differ in various important respects. Spectators worthy of credit have seen the latter terminate in the fall of solid bodies; and the composition of these solid bodies has been found to differ from that of all the known fossil substances on the surface of the globe. It is in vain, then, to allege, that they are formed on the ground by common lightning, which has often produced very extraordinary effects, but which never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> thousands of stones in fine calm weather. The supposition, that such stones have been projected from some of our volcanoes, is hardly less conceivable. The ashes which accompany a violent eruption of Etna or Vesuvius have, from their levity, been carried to a very considerable distance; but we are totally unacquainted with any projectile force which could dart solid masses many hundred miles, through such a dense medium as the atmosphere. The compact lavas of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> are never found\nfound remote from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of their formation, and none of them present the characters and aspect of the stones which we have described. M. Bory de St Vincent, indeed, in his *Voyage dans les quatre Principales \u00celes des Mers d'Afrique*, very pompously expounds a doctrine, which, in our opinion, carries its confusion along with it. According to this writer, meteorites were projected from immense depths, in an early stage of the earth's existence, when igneous mountains were ended with propelling forces sufficient to drive masses of matter into the regions of space, where they were constrained to obey, for ages, the combined laws of impulse and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVITATION\">gravitation</a>, until, in the progress of time, their spiral revolutions at length terminated on the surface of their native earth. Before we can adopt such an extravagant hypothesis, we must be convinced, that at one period of the history of our globe, the agency of subterranean fire was adequate to communicate planetary motion to splinters of rock, without heaving up the rocks themselves, and that the rotatory movement, though once established, must gradually diminish and cease. The demonstration of these positions is surely not less arduous than the explanation of the phenomenon which they are intended to solve.\n\nOf those who contend for the *atmospherical* formation of meteorites, scarcely any two agree in regard to the manner by which such formation is effected. Patrin, who is solicitous to extend and illustrate his darling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of volcanoes, labours at great length to maintain the existence of a regular circulation of gaseous fluids between the primitive schistose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a> of the globe, and its surrounding atmosphere, and, from this fancied circulation, which he flatters himself he has demonstrated, he deduces, quite at his ease, the occasional ignition and concretion of portions of these fluids in the higher regions of the air. This ingenious mineralogist and geologist is so extremely tenacious of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> that we shall not attempt to disturb his self complacency; but he will excuse us if we refuse our assent to results which rest on imaginary foundations. The celebrated Mulchenbroeck, in one part of his writings, attributes the descent of stones from the air to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, an opinion which later observations have disproved. In other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>, however, he seems to incline to a modification of the atmospherical hypotheses, and endeavours to trace the origin of shooting stars to an accumulation of the volatile matters which are suspended in the air. It is extremely probable, that shooting stars and fiery meteors have an intimate relation to one another, if they are not identical appearances; but it is certain that the former move at a much greater distance from our earth than fireballs, and only occasion a transient luminous appearance in their passage through the upper regions of the atmosphere. Perhaps they are analogous to those telegraphic sparks of light which were observed by M. Schr\u00f6ter. Mulchenbroeck, however, adopts the vulgar notion of their falling to the earth, and seems to confound their residue with *tremella nufloc*. M. Salverte has given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> to the theory of formation from vapours, by having recourse to the agency of hydrogen gas. According to him, in consequence of the decomposition of water, which is constantly going on at the surface of the earth, immense quantities of hydrogen gas are continually rising into the atmosphere, and ascending to its higher regions. As this gas is capable of dissolving metals, it carries along with it a portion of iron and nickel. During thunder storms this gas is kindled by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a>; the metals are depoited, reduced, melted, and vitrified; in other words, meteors are produced and stones formed. This hypothesis is scarcely more satisfactory than the others. It does not account for the presence of magnesia and silica, nor does it explain why the stones are always composed of the same materials. Besides, the existence of hydrogen gas in the atmosphere has not been proved, far less that it forms a separate atmosphere, which is contrary to all experience; and it is well known, that a little hydrogen, mixed with a large portion of atmospheric air, cannot be fired by electricity. In general, we may observe, that if the origin of meteorites be really atmospherical, the matters of which they are composed must have existed in one of two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, namely, in very attenuated particles or concretions of the matters themselves volatilized and held in solution in the air, or only in the elements of these matters. In the first case, when abandoned by their menstruum to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> tendencies, they would unite by aggregation only; in the second by chemical combination. Now, we can hardly suppose that disengagement of light and violent detonation should result from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> of aggregation, whereas they are strictly symptomatic of the affinity of composition. This, and various other considerations which might be stated, if we could make room for them, induce us to regard the doctrine of combination as the most plausible. M. Izarn, who has published a treatise on *Atmospheric Lithology*, has entered into a tedious and somewhat obscure exposition of his own theory, founded on this principle. We shall give the summary, as nearly as we can, in his own words.\n\n\"Gaseous substances, arranged in spherical masses in the upper regions of the air, being admitted, the various agitations of the atmosphere should naturally waft some of these masses from their inflating medium into one capable of combining with them. If the combination begins, the disengagement of light is explained. In proportion as the combination advances, the specific gravities are changed; and, consequently, a change of place will commence, and that in the quarter which presents least resistance, or where the medium is most rarefied, in course rather towards the south than the north. Hence, most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FIRE_BALLS\">fire-balls</a> are observed to move from north to south, or from north-east to south-west. Motion being once impressed, the mass traverses other media, capable of supplying new principles, which still increasing the weight, determine the curve; and when at length the principles which are at work, and which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> in all directions, have attained the requisite proportion for extinguishing the elements in the birth of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a>, the grand operation is announced by the explosion, and the product takes its place among the solids.\"\u2014That the stones in question are produced by chemical combination in the higher regions of the atmosphere, and that they are thus formed from their own elements, are suppositions fully as probable as any that have been advanced on the subject; but whether the union of their parts be effected in the manner detailed by M. Izarn, we are unable to determine, both because we are uncertain if we perfectly comprehend\nhis meaning, and because our range of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATA\">data</a> is as yet too circumscribed, to warrant any specific or decisive conclusions.\n\nA much bolder theory has been suggested, and its possibility demonstrated by the celebrated French astronomer, La Place, who shews, that meteorites may be the products of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> volcanoes. As this romantic view of the subject has obtained the suffrages of some men of science, and has excited the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> of others, we shall present the reasoning on which it is founded in the popular and perspicuous language of Dr Hutton of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOLWICH\">Woolwich</a>.\n\n\"As the attraction of gravitation extends through the whole planetary system, a body placed at the surface of the moon is affected chiefly by two forces, one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> it toward the centre of the earth, and another drawing it toward that of the moon. The latter of these forces, however, near the moon's surface, is incomparably the greater. But, as we recede from the moon, and approach toward the earth, this force decreases, while the other augments; till at last a point of attraction is found between the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a>, where these forces are exactly equal, so that a body placed there must remain at rest; but if it be removed still nearer to the earth, then this planet would have the superior attraction, and the body must fall towards it. If a body then be projected from the moon towards the earth, with a force sufficient to carry it beyond the point of equal attraction, it must necessarily fall on the earth. Such then is the idea of the manner in which the bodies must be made to pass from the moon to the earth, if that can be done, the possibility of which is now necessary to be considered.\n\n\"Now supposing a mass to be projected from the moon, in a direct line towards the earth, by a volcano, or by the production of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a> by subterranean heat; and supposing for the present these two planets to remain at rest; then it has been demonstrated, on the Newtonian estimation of the moon's mass, that a force projecting the body with a velocity of 12,000 feet in a second, would be sufficient to carry it beyond the point of equal attraction. But this estimate of the moon's mass is now allowed to be much above the truth; and on M. la Place's calculation, it appears that a force of little more than half the above power would be sufficient to produce the effect, that is, a force capable of projecting a body with a velocity of less than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> and a half per second. But we have known cannon balls projected by the force of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a>, with a velocity of 2500 feet per second or upwards, that is, about half a mile. It follows, therefore, that a projectile force, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> a velocity about three times that of a cannon ball, would be sufficient to throw the body from the moon beyond the point of equal attraction, and cause it to reach the earth. Now there can be little doubt that a force equal to that is exerted by volcanoes on the earth, as well as by the production of steam by subterranean heat, when we consider the huge masses of rock, so many times larger than cannon balls, thrown on such occasions to heights also so much greater. We may easily imagine, too, such cause of motion to exist in the moon as well as in the earth, and that in a superior degree, if we may judge from the supposed symptoms of volcanoes recently observed in the moon by the powerful tubes of Dr Herschel; and still more, if we consider that all projections from the earth suffer an enormous resistance and diminution, by the dense atmosphere of this planet; while it has been rendered probable, from optical considerations, that the moon has little or no atmosphere at all, to give any such resistance to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROJECTILES\">projectiles</a>.\n\n\"Thus then we are fully authorized in concluding, that the case of possibility is completely made out; that a known power exists in nature, capable of producing the foregoing effect, of detaching a mass of matter from the moon, and transferring it to the earth in the form of a flaming meteor, or burning stone; at the same time we are utterly ignorant of any other process in nature by which the same phenomenon can be produced. Having thus discovered a way in which it is possible to produce those appearances, we shall now endeavour to show, from all the concomitant circumstances, that these accord exceedingly well with the natural effects of the supposed cause, and thence give it a very high degree of probability.\n\n\"This important desideratum will perhaps be best attained, by examining the consequences of a substance supposed to be projected by a volcano from the moon into the sphere of the earth's superior attraction; and then comparing those with the known and visible phenomena of the blazing meteors or burning stones that fall through the air on the earth. And if in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> a striking coincidence or resemblance shall always or mostly be found, it will be difficult for the human mind to resist the persuasion that the assumed cause involves a degree of probability but little short of certainty itself. Now the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> phenomena attending these blazing meteors or burning stones, are these:\n\n1. That they appear or blaze out suddenly.\n2. That they move with a surprising rapid motion, nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a>, but a little inclined downwards.\n3. That they move in several different directions with respect to the points of the compass.\n4. That in their flight they yield a loud whizzing sound.\n5. That they commonly burst with a violent explosion and report.\n6. That they fall on the earth with great force in a sloping direction.\n7. That they are very hot at first, remain hot a considerable time, and exhibit visible tokens of fusion on their surface.\n8. That the fallen stony masses have all the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> appearance and contexture, as well as internally the same nature and composition.\n9. That they are totally different from all our terrestrial bodies, both natural and artificial.\n\n\"Now these phenomena will naturally compare with the circumstances of a substance projected by a lunar volcano, and in the order in which they are here enumerated. And first, with respect to the leading circumstance, that of a sudden blazing meteoric appearance, which is not that of a small bright spark, first seen at an immense distance, and then gradually increasing with the diminution of its distance. And this circumstance appears very naturally to result from the assumed cause. For, the body being projected from a lunar volcano, may well be supposed in an ignited state, like inflamed matter thrown up by our terrestrial volcanoes, which passing through the comparatively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VACUUM\">vacuum</a>, in the space between the moon and the earth's sensible atmosphere, it will probably enter the superior parts of this atmosphere with but little diminution of its original...\"\nnal heat; from which circumstance, united with that of its violent motion, this being 10 or 12 times that of a cannon ball, and through a part of the atmosphere probably consisting chiefly of the inflammable gas rising from the earth to the top of the atmosphere, the body may well be supposed to be suddenly inflamed, as the natural effect of these circumstances; indeed it would be surprising if it did not. From whence it appears that the sudden inflammation of the body, on entering the earth's atmosphere, is exactly what might be expected to happen.\n\n\"2. To trace the body through the earth's atmosphere; we are to observe that it enters the top of it with the great velocity acquired by descending from the point of equal attraction, which is such as would carry the body to the earth's surface in a very few additional seconds of time if it met with no obstruction. But as it enters deeper in the atmosphere, it meets with still more and more resistance from the increasing density of the air, by which the great velocity of six miles per second must soon be greatly reduced to one that will be uniform, and only a small part of its former great velocity. This remaining part of its motion will be various in different bodies, being more or less as the body is larger or smaller, and as it is more or less specifically heavy; but, for a particular instance, if the body were a globe of 12 inches diameter, and of the same gravity as the atmospheric stones, the motion would decrease so as to be little more than a quarter of a mile per second of perpendicular descent. Now while the body is thus descending, the earth itself is affected by a twofold motion, both the diurnal and the annual one, with both of which the descent of the body is to be compounded. The earth's motion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a> at the equator is about 17 miles in a minute, or two-sevenths of a mile in a second; but in the middle latitudes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> little more than half of that, or little above half a quarter of a mile in a second; and if we compound this motion with that of the descending body, as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>, this may cause the body to appear to descend obliquely, though but a little, the motion being nearer the perpendicular than the horizontal direction. But the other motion of the earth, or that in its annual course, is about 20 miles in a second, which is 80 times greater than the perpendicular descent in the instance above-mentioned; so that, if this motion be compounded with the descending one of the body, it must necessarily give it the appearance of a very rapid motion, in a direction nearly parallel to the horizon, but a little declining downwards. A circumstance which exactly agrees with the appearances of these meteoric bodies, as stated in the second article of the enumerated phenomena.\n\n\"3. Again, with regard to the apparent direction of the body; this will evidently be various, being that compounded of the body's descent and the direction of the earth's annual motion at the time of the fall, which is itself various in the different seasons of the year, according to the direction of the several points of the ecliptic to the earth's meridian or axis. Usually, however, from the great excess of the earth's motion above that of the falling body, the direction of this must appear to be nearly opposite to that of the former. And in fact this exactly agrees with a remark made by Dr Halley, in his account of the meteors in his paper above given, where he says that the direction of the meteor's motion was exactly opposite to that of the earth in her orbit. And if this shall generally be found to be the case, it will prove a powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of this theory of the lunar substances. Unfortunately, however, the observations on this point are very few, and mostly inaccurate; the angle or direction of the fallen stones has not been recorded; and that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> meteor commonly mistaken, all the various observers giving it a different course, some even directly the reverse of others. In future, it will be very advisable that the observers of fallen stones, observe and record the direction or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> of the perforation made by the body in the earth, which will give us perhaps the course of the path nearer than any other observation.\n\n\"4. In the flight of these meteoric stones, it is commonly observed, that they yield a loud whizzing sound. Indeed it would be surprising if they did not. For if the like sound be given by the smooth and regularly formed cannon ball, and heard at a considerable distance, how exceedingly great must be that of a body so much larger, which is of an irregular form and surface too, and striking the air with 50 or 100 times the velocity.\n\n\"5. That they commonly burst and fly in pieces in their rapid flight, is a circumstance exceedingly likely to happen, both from the violent state of fusion on their surface, and from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> rapidity of their motion through the air. If a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> stone, from its quick rotation, be sometimes burst and fly in pieces, and if the same thing happen to cannon balls when made of stone and discharged with considerable velocity, merely by the friction and resistance of the air; how much more is the same to be expected to happen to the atmospheric stones, moving with more than 50 times the velocity, and when their surface may well be supposed to be partly loosened or dissolved by the extremity of the heat there.\n\n\"6. That the stones strike the ground with a great force, and penetrate to a considerable depth, as is usually observed, is a circumstance only to be expected from the extreme rapidity of their motion, and their great weight, when we consider that a cannon ball, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a> shell, will often <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> itself many inches, or even some feet in the earth.\n\n\"7. That these stones, when soon sought after and found, are hot, and exhibit the marks of recent fusion, are also the natural consequences of the extreme degree of inflammation in which their surface had been put during their flight through the air.\n\n\"8. That these stony masses have all the same external appearance and contexture, as well as internally the same nature and composition, are circumstances that strongly point out an identity of origin, whatever may be the cause to which they owe so generally uniform a conformation. And when it is considered,\n\n\"9. That in those respects they differ totally from all terrestrial compositions hitherto known or discovered, they lead the mind strongly to ascribe them to some other origin than the earth we inhabit; and none so likely as coming from our neighbouring planet.\n\n\"Upon the whole then (continues Dr Hutton), it appears...\"\nappears highly probable, that the flaming meteors, and the burning stones, that fall on the earth, are one and the same thing. It also appears impossible, or in the extreme degree improbable, to ascribe these either to a formation in the superior parts of the atmosphere, or to the eruptions of terrestrial volcanoes, or to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> by lightning striking the earth. But, on the other hand, that it is possible for such masses to be projected from the moon so as to reach the earth; and that all the phenomena of these meteors or falling stones, having a surprising conformity with the circumstances of masses that may be expelled from the moon by natural causes, unite in forming a body of strong evidence, that this is in all probability and actually the case.\n\nM. Poisson, an ingenious French mathematician, has shown by an algebraical calculation, the possibility of a projectile reaching our planet from the moon. His calculation, however, which may be found in the work of Izarn, quoted above, (p. 238. et seq.) proceeds on the supposition that our satellite has no atmosphere, or next to none. There are, no doubt, appearances which seem to favour this supposition, but they do not amount to positive proof of the fact. Even could the latter be established, the combustion of a volcano, without the presence of atmospheric air, would remain to be explained. But, granting this difficulty too to be surmounted, there are other circumstances which we cannot easily reconcile to the lunar hypothesis. The occasional arrival of fragments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAVA\">lava</a> on the earth's surface, would argue, on a fair computation of chances, such a copious discharge of volcanic matters, that the moon, by this time, would consist of hardly any thing else. Again, if we may be allowed to reason from analogy, the volcanic productions of the moon should exhibit varieties of aspect and composition like those with which we are acquainted, and not a definite and precise number of the same ingredients. We may also remark, that the soft and incoherent state of several of the recent specimens of meteorites can ill accord with their supposed pallage through any considerable portion of space; and that the l'Aigle phenomenon, which is so distinctly recorded, evidently suggests the notion of instantaneous formation in the atmosphere. And, though this view of the subject may be regarded by some as inexplicable, we cannot conceive that it is more so than the doctrine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRYSTALLIZATION\">crystallization</a>, or than many of the results of chemical combination, whose existence it is impossible to deny. These and other arguments may, we apprehend, be fairly urged against any theory which attempts to explain the history of meteors by the agency of lunar volcanoes.\n\nThe hypothesis of Dr Chladni, which likewise boasts of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a>, though still more extravagant than the preceding, deserves to be stated. As earthy, metallic, and other particles form the principal component parts of our planet, among which iron is the prevailing part, other planetary bodies, he affirms, may consist of similar, or, perhaps, the same component parts, though combined and modified in a very different manner. There may also be dense matters accumulated in smaller masses, without being in immediate connexion with the larger planetary bodies, dispersed throughout infinite space, and which, being impelled either by some projecting power or attraction, continue to move until they approach the earth, or some other body; when, being overcome by attractive force, they immediately fall down. By their exceeding great velocity, still increased by the attraction of the earth and the violent friction in the atmosphere, a strong electricity and heat must necessarily be excited, by which means they are reduced to a flaming and melted condition, and great quantities of vapour and different kinds of gases are thus disengaged, which distend the liquid mass to a monstrous size, till, by a still farther expansion of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> fluids, they must at length explode. That portions of comical matter are allowed to revolve in space, and to terminate their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> on the surface of a planet, is a position too gratuitous and vague, to be readily admitted, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> of which involves no principle of atheism or impiety, as some of Dr Chladni's antagonists have very unhandsomely infamated. If worlds disappear and others <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> into existence, a sportive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> may be permitted to indulge in the innocent supposition, that fragments of their materials are detached from their fractured masses, and obey those laws of attraction which seem to extend their influence to the remotest corners of the universe.\n\nSuch of our readers as are solicitous of obtaining more ample information on the subject of this article, may consult Izarn's Lithologie Atmospherique; Biot's Relation d'un Voyage fait dans le departement de l'<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORNE\">Orne</a>, pour constater la realite d'un Meteor observe a l'Aigle; Boettiger's Observations on the Accounts given by ancient authors of Stones said to have fallen, from the Clouds; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FULDA\">Fulda</a>'s Memoir on Fire-balls; Cavallo's Elements of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">Natural <a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a>; Klaproth on Meteoric Stones; Solandt's Account of the Tufcan Meteor; Chladni's Treatise on the Siberian Masses of Iron; Mr Edward King's Remarks concerning Stones said to have fallen, from the Clouds; and several of the more recent transactions of learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a> and periodical scientific communications, as those of the Royal Society of London, of the Institute at Paris, the Journal de Physique, Annales de Chimie, Bibliotheque Britannique, Decade Philosophique, Journal des Mines, Philosophical Magazine, Nicholson's Journal, &c. &c.","sp":297,"ep":312},{"h":"METEOROLOGICAL","t":"something belonging to meteors.\n\nMeteorological Journal, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> recording the daily state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, exhibited by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAROMETER\">barometer</a>, thermometer, hygrometer, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANEMOMETER\">anemometer</a>, and other meteorological instruments.

In as far as it describes the phenomena produced by such changes, meteorology is a department of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">natural <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>; but in its attempts to account for the appearances, it is almost entirely dependent on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">Natural <a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">Chemistry</a>.\n\nThe connection of Meteorology with Chemistry is sufficiently evident to those who take only a superficial view of the subject, though it has only of late attracted the notice of philosophers. That the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> is sometimes hotter and sometimes colder than usual; that it is at one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> much rarefied, and at another greatly condensed; now uncommonly dry, and now furnished with moisture\u2014are circumstances that daily meet the senses of the most casual observer, as they are circumstances that powerfully, and often unpleasantly, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARREST\">arrest</a> his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. That these changes are the result of decompositions and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> that are continually going on in the atmosphere, and of new modifications of its component principles, is manifest to him who is acquainted merely with the first elements of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> chemistry.\n\nIndeed to modern chemistry this science is indebted for the progress it has made within the last 50 years; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> which may be considered as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> epoch of meteorology. In fact, this science is still in its infancy; but from the ardour with which it is now cultivated, from the abilities of the philosophers who are engaged in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>, and from the progress that is daily making in the kindred sciences, we may reasonably look forward to a period, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> great distance, when it shall please the great Author of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> to unveil many of those wonders which are now involved in darkness and obscurity, and permit us to control the jarring elements, as he has allowed us to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> dominion over the beasts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, the fowls of the air, and the fishes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>.\n\nA late ingenious writer on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> has suggested some useful hints for the improvement of meteorology, which we shall here extract. \"With this view, our first step must be that recommended by Mr Kirwan and others, to establish corresponding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a> in different parts of the world; these societies must be furnished with similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a>, equally adjusted, and graduated in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>, for making observations on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>. In our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be necessary to procure registers, carefully kept, from the different parts of the sea <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, and from those parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> situated in the interior. The various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAROMETER\">barometer</a>, thermometer, hygrometer, and electroscope, should be carefully noted; with the variations and the degrees of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, as well as the diurnal and nocturnal aspect of the heavens discriminately marked; the appearance of the sky; and in familiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, such as might be understood by the respective and distant observers; for instance, whether the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> is totally or partially obscured by vapour;\u2014whether the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a> are mottled, or fleaky;\u2014whether they assume the appearance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> streaks, or appear in radii apparently from a centre\u2014or in masses of dense vapour\u2014or loose and fleecy\u2014or those familiarly known by the name of mare-tail clouds\u2014with any other new or accustomed phenomena. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> terms fair, cloudy, or wet, are insufficient for forming a judgement of the weather; as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> fair is generally at present expressed only in opposition to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>, without distinguishing whether the atmosphere is obscure, dull, or bright. The appearance of the stratum of air on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EARTH_S\">earth's</a> surface, that is, the space between the clouds and the earth, should be always accurately described. Is there a blue haze, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIST\">mist</a>, and dense fog? or is the air transparent? which is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> when distant objects appear more than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> distinct and near to the eye of the observer: the temperature of the ocean at full tide should be frequently ascertained, as it will be found to have considerable influence in these respects on an insular country. By the remarks of observers, stationed in various parts of our coasts, we should soon be enabled to discover when vapour is wafted in from the sea, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> by the aqueous and vegetable surface of our island. During a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-west wind, which is frequently attended with storms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIL\">hail</a> and rain, and usually experienced in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, an observer stationed on the coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SLIGO\">Sligo</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, or Denbighshire in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>, might ascertain whether the disposition of the atmosphere to storm and cloud came in with the air from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATLANTIC_OCEAN\">Atlantic ocean</a>, or was generated by the vapours of our own island. It would be desirable also again, that the temperature and blue hazy appearance of the atmosphere during the north-east winds, so common in May and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>, should be noticed by observers on the north-east coast, in the counties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINCOLN\">Lincoln</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSEX\">Essex</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KENT\">Kent</a>; and by others, on the opposite western coasts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEMBROKE\">Pembroke</a>, Devon, and Cornwall, so as to determine what changes in temperature this wind undergoes in its passage over the island; and whether or not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of haze increases or diminishes by its progress from either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>; and whether the vapour is more or less disposed to produce storms?\n\nBy such comparative observations on the coast, conjoined with those made by others in the central parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, we might rapidly proceed in meteorological science, or, as it is commonly called, a knowledge of the weather. The observations made in the interior of the country would enable us at all times to trace the origin and progress of storms; in situations where tillage or pasturage is most attended to, the effects of spring frosts and blights should be particularly noticed, as well as the first appearance of the aphid and coccus, the caterpillar and larvae of other insects, on fruit trees, and particularly those peculiar to the hop plantations. The first opening of the vernal foliage on trees...\ntrees and hedges in the spring, should likewise be remarked, and compared with the starting up grass on the highly manured pastures in the neighbourhood of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, and on those also affixed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a>, as well as the natural herbage on the commons and wastes. Some attention should be paid to the effects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a> storms, in destroying the aphis and other destructive insects, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEAT\">peat</a> of fruit and hop plantations; and the first appearance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILDEW\">mildew</a> or rust on wheat should be particularly observed, and remarks made to ascertain, whether or not the moisture, which occasions the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> in its commencement was attended with wind and rain, or a clove damp state of the air. The different kinds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, where the crops, from the disease, suffered most, should be noticed, and the situation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> for ventilation, with the height of the fences, size of inclosures, and vicinity to coppices, trees, or hedge-rows.\n\nThe importance of the study of meteorology requires little elucidation. In climates where the succession of seasons is nearly stated and regular, where the periods of parching drought or deluging torrents, of the tempestuous hurricane or the refreshing breeze, are fixed and ascertained, mankind has little to do, but expect the dreaded changes, and provide against their devastations; but in countries like our own, where all the vicissitudes of seasons may take place in the course of a few hours, it is of the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> to investigate the nature of the change, and the circumstances that precede or accompany it. To the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a>, the mariner, the traveller, the physician, meteorology is in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> a study of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>; to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> it is a study of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> and delight; and to the observer of nature it affords objects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a> and sublimity not to be found in any other department of his favourite science. Surely nothing can contribute more to elevate the mind of man, to raise it \"from nature up to nature's God,\" than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> of the sweeping whirlwind, the dazzling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a>, or the awful thunder.\n\nOur limits will not admit of our entering into a historical detail of the progress of meteorology; but it may be proper in this place to enumerate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> writers on this science both in our own country and on the continent.\n\nIn this country, we may reckon Dr Kirwan, (in his \"Estimate of the Temperature of different Climates,\"\n\nhis \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on the Variations of the Atmosphere,\" and Introduction in the \"Irish Transactions\"), Mr John Dalton (chiefly in the \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANCHESTER\">Manchester</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a>\"), Col. Capper (in his \"Observations on the Winds and Monsoons\"), Mr Writers on Williams (in his \"Climate of Great Britain\"), and meteorologist Luke Howard (in the Philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a>), as the principal cultivators of meteorological knowledge; and on the continent, the names of Cotte (\"Traite de Meteorologie,\" and Journal de Physique), Saussure (\"Essai sur l'Hygrometrie,\" and Voyage aux Alpes\"), De Luc (a) (\"Recherches sur les Modifications de l'Atmosphere,\" Idees sur la Meteorologie,\" and other works), and Lamarck (See Journ. de Phys. pafifim) stand most conspicuous in this branch of natural science.\n\nIn considering the subject of meteorology, we may properly divide it into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> general heads: 1. of the changes which take place in the gravity of the air; 2. of the changes of the temperature of the air; 3. of the changes produced by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> and rain; 4. of the changes produced by winds; 5. of atmospherical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a>; 6. of meteors or those visible phenomena accompanied with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, which take place in the atmosphere or near the surface of the earth; and 7. the application of the principles of meteorology to the useful purposes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. Of these heads, the fifth has been already fully considered under Electricity, and much of the sixth has been exhausted under Meteorolite. The remaining circumstances will form the subjects of the following chapters.\n\nCHAP. I. Of the Changes which take place in the Gravity of the Air.\n\nMany of the facts relating to this part of our subject have been already anticipated under the article Barometer, and several circumstances <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> to be considered more properly under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PNEUMATICS\">Pneumatics</a> than in this place. We shall here confine ourselves to a general view of the changes in the gravity of the atmosphere, as indicated by the barometer, in various situations on or near the surface of the earth, and briefly examine the conclusions that may be drawn from them.\n\nThe most general fact indicated by the barometer is, that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> shows us the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> of air <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of the sea,\n\n(A) In again mentioning the name of a philosopher so respectable as M. de Luc, we embrace the first opportunity of doing him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, and of vindicating his character against an unfortunate misconception of the late Professor Robison, a mistake which we have inadvertently contributed to disseminate, by quoting Dr Robison's statement in our account of Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a>, where M. de Luc is accused of having arrogated to himself Dr Black's discovery of latent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>.\n\nM. de Luc's vindication of himself (as printed in the 12th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> Review) is before the public. We owe it to candour and justice to acknowledge our conviction that Dr Robison was too hasty in his assertion, and that M. de Luc, so far from arrogating to himself the doctrine of latent heat, has, in various parts of his numerous writings, expressly mentioned Dr Black as the author of that doctrine. This will appear from the following citations. In his \"Introduction \u00e0 la Physique terrestre,\" p. 102, M. de Luc thus expresses himself.\n\n\"Ne connoissant point le feu latent, dans la vapeur \u00e0 toute temp\u00e9rature, dont la premi\u00e8re d\u00e9couverte est due au Dr Black, &c. Again, p. 232 of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>. \"Ce qui d\u00e9veloppe l'id\u00e9e de chaleur latente par laquelle le Dr Black avoue d\u00e9gager ce ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne,\"\u2014and at p. 385, \"Le Dr Black ayant d\u00e9couvert qu'une certaine quantit\u00e9 de chaleur dispara\u00eet quand la vapeur de l'eau bouillante se forme, nomma ce ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne chaleur latente dans la vapeur.\"\n\nWe trust that these quotations, with M. de Luc's own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTIFICATION\">justification</a> of himself above referred to, will be sufficient to exculpate him from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of literary felony so warmly brought against him by Professor Robison; and we have no doubt the Professor himself, were he still alive, would under such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> retract his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCUSATION\">accusation</a>.\nGravity of air whose base is equal to the diameter of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> in the tube, and whose height is equal to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the atmosphere above the place of observation. As the height of this column must vary in different situations, and must, ceteris paribus, be greatest, at the level of the sea, the mercury in the tube will, under the same circumstances, stand highest in such a situation.\n\nThe medium height of the barometer at the level of the sea is 30 inches, as has been found by observations in the British channel, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a> sea, at the temperatures of 54\u00b0 and 60\u00b0; on the coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERU\">Peru</a> at the temperature of 84\u00b0, and in latitude 89\u00b0.\n\nAs we ascend above the surface of the earth, the medium height of the mercury diminishes; and some late observations made in balloons at a considerable distance above the tops of the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, have shewn that in the higher regions of the air, the column of mercury is very considerably shortened. This fact, as we have seen (see Barometer), has been usefully applied to the measuring of heights and depths that cannot be ascertained by the usual geometrical methods.\n\nAs the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> gravity of the atmosphere is constantly varying, even in the same place, the column of air pressing on the surface of the mercury without the tube, must press with more or less force, in proportion as these changes are greater; and hence the barometer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> out these variations, falling when the atmosphere is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a>, and rising when it is heavier than usual.\n\nFor an account of the observations that were made on the rise and fall of the barometer by the earlier philosophers, and the attempts which were made by them to explain these phenomena, see Barometer.\n\nIt will be of advantage here to consider the variations of the barometer, as they take place in different situations, in order, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> possible, to point out the cause by which these variations are produced, as this cause must have considerable influence on the changes of the weather.\n\nIt is found, that between the tropics the variations of the barometer are exceedingly small, and it is remarkable, that in that part of the world it does not descend above half as much for every 200 feet of elevation as it does beyond the tropics*. In the torrid zone, too, the barometer is elevated about \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of a line twice every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>; and this elevation happens at the same time with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a> of the sea\u2020.\n\nAs the latitude advances towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLES\">poles</a>, the range of the barometer gradually increases, till at last it amounts to two or three inches. This gradual increase will appear from the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>.\n\n| Latitude | Places     | Range of the Barometer |\n|----------|------------|------------------------|\n| 6\u00b0       | Peru       | Greatest: 0.20         |\n| 22\u00b0      | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CALCUTTA\">Calcutta</a>   | 0.77                   |\n| 40\u00b0      | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a>     | 1.00                   |\n| 51\u00b0      | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOVER\">Dover</a>      | 2.47                   |\n| 53\u00b0      | Middlewick | 3.00                   |\n| 53\u00b0      | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVERPOOL\">Liverpool</a>  | 2.89                   |\n| 59\u00b0      | Pittsburgh | 3.43                   |\n\nThere is, however, some exception to this general rule, as in North <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> the range of the barometer is much less than in the corresponding European latitudes.\n\nThe range of the barometer is greater at the level of the sea than on mountains, and in the same degree of latitude the extent of the range is in the inverse ratio of the height of the place above the level of the sea.\n\nIt appears probable that the barometer has a tendency to rise during the day from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> to evening, and that this tendency is greatest between 2 and 9 P.M., the greatest elevation being at this last period. The elevation at 2 differs from that at 9 by \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), while that at 2 differs from the morning elevation only by \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\); and that in certain climates the greatest elevation takes place at 2 o'clock*.\n\nThe range of the barometer is greater in winter than in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, as appears from some observations made at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KENDAL\">Kendal</a> during five years; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> range from October to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> being 7.982, and that from April to September being only 5.447\u2020.\n\nWhen the atmosphere is serene and settled the mercury is generally high; and in calm weather, when it is inclined to rain, the mercury is low. On the approach of high winds it sinks, as it does with a southerly wind, but rises very high on the approach of easterly and northerly winds. It is found, however, that at Calcutta the mercury is highest with north-westerly and northerly, and lowest with south-easterly winds.\n\nThe mercury suddenly falls on the approach of tempests, and during their continuance undergoes great oscillations.\n\nTo these general facts that have been observed on the rise and fall of the barometer, we shall annex the following axioms by M. Cotte:\n\n1. The greatest changes of the barometer commonly take place during clear weather, with a north wind, and the small risings during cloudy, rainy, or windy weather, with a south, or nearly south wind.\n\n2. The state of the mercury changes more in the winter than in the summer months; so that its greatest rising and falling takes place in winter; but its mean elevation is greater in summer than in winter.\n\n3. The changes of the state of the barometer are nearly null at the equator, and become greater the more one removes from it towards the poles.\n\n4. They are more considerable in valleys than on mountains.\n\n5. The more variable the wind, the more changeable the state of the barometer.\n\n6. It is lower at midnight and noon than at other periods of the day; its greatest daily height is towards evening.\n\n7. Between 10 at night and 2 in the morning, and also in the day, the rising and falling of the mercury are less; the contrary is the case between 6 and 10 in the morning and evening.\n\n8. Between 2 and 6 in the morning and evening it rises as often as it falls; but in such a manner that it oftener rises about that time in the winter months, and falls oftener in the summer months.\n\n9. The oscillations are less in summer, greater in winter, and very great at the equinoxes.\n\n10. They\nThey are greater also in the daytime than during the night.\n\n11. The higher the sun rises above the horizon, the less are the oscillations; they increase as he approaches the western side of the horizon, and are exceedingly great when he comes opposite to the eastern part of the horizon.\n\n12. They are, to a certain degree, independent of the changes of temperature.\n\n13. The mercury generally rises between the new and the full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, and falls between the latter and the new moon.\n\n14. It rises more in the apogee than the perigee; it usually rises between the northern lunifice and the southern, and falls between the southern lunifice and the northern.\n\n15. In general, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of the variations of the mercury with the positions of the moon gives nothing certain; the results of No. 13. and 14. are the most constant.\n\n16. In the neighbourhood of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> the barometer never continues 24 hours without changing.\n\n17. The barometers in the western districts rise and fall sooner than those in the more eastern.\n\n18. When the sun passes the meridian, the mercury, if falling, continues to fall, and its fall is often hastened.\n\n19. When the mercury at the same period is rising, it falls, remains <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a>, or rises more slowly.\n\n20. When the mercury, under the same circumstances, is stationary, it falls, unless before or after it becomes stationary, it has been in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of rising.\n\n21. The above changes commonly take place between 11 in the morning and 1 in the afternoon, but oftener before than after noon.\n\n22. Before high tides there is almost always a great fall of the mercury; this takes place oftener at the full than the new moon.\n\nSuch is a general view of the variations in the gravity of the air, as far as they have been observed by the barometer; and we shall now endeavour to give some plausible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of them.\n\nIt is evident that the density of the atmosphere is least at the equator, and greatest at the poles; for at the equator the centrifugal force, the distance from the centre of the earth, and the heat (all of which tend to diminish the density of the air), are at their maximum, while at the poles they are at their minimum.\n\nThe mean height of the barometer at the level of the sea, all over the globe, is 30 inches; the weight of the atmosphere, therefore, is the same all over the globe. This weight depends on the density and height of the air; where the density is greatest, its height must be least; and on the contrary, where its density is least, its height must be greatest. The height of the atmosphere, therefore, must be greatest at the equator, and least at the poles; and it must decrease gradually between the equator and the poles, so that its upper surface will resemble two inclined planes, meeting above the equator their highest part.*\n\nDuring summer, when the sun is in our hemisphere, the mean heat between the equator and the pole does not differ so much as in winter. Hence the rarity of the atmosphere at the pole, and consequently its height, will be increased. The upper surface of the atmosphere, therefore, in the northern hemisphere, will be less inclined; while that of the southern hemisphere, from contrary causes, will be much more inclined. The reverse will take place during our winter.\n\nThe density of the atmosphere depends in a great measure on the pressure of the superincumbent column, and therefore decreases according to the height, as the pressure of the superincumbent column constantly decreases. But the density of the atmosphere in the torrid zone will not decrease so fast as in the temperate and frigid zones, because its column is larger, and because there is a greater proportion of air in the higher part of this column. This accounts for the observation of Mr. Caffon, that the barometer sinks only half as much for every 200 feet of elevation in the torrid as in the temperate zones. The density of the atmosphere at the equator, therefore, though at the surface of the earth it is least, must at a certain height equal, and at a still greater must exceed, the density of the atmosphere in the temperate zones and at the poles.\n\nWe shall presently endeavour to prove, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of air is constantly ascending at the equator, and mercury is that part of it at least reaches and continues in the highest in er parts of the atmosphere. From the fluidity of air, northern it is evident that it cannot accumulate above the equa-titudes, but must roll <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCLINED_PLANE\">inclined <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> which the upper surface of the atmosphere assumes towards the poles. As the surface of the atmosphere of the northern hemisphere is more inclined during our winter than that of the southern hemisphere, a greater quantity of the equatorial current of air must flow over upon the northern than upon the southern hemisphere; so that the quantity of our atmosphere will be greater during winter than that of the southern hemisphere; but during summer the reverse will take place. Hence the greatest mercurial heights take place during winter, and the range of the barometer is less in summer than in winter.\n\nThe density of the atmosphere is in a great measure regulated by the heat of the place; wherever the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> is greatest, there the density of the atmosphere will be greatest, and its column thickest. High countries, and ranges of lofty mountains, the tops of which are covered with snow the greatest part of the year, must be much colder than other places situated in the same degree of latitude, and consequently the column of air over them much shorter. The current of superior air will linger and accumulate over these places in its passage towards the poles, and thus occasion an irregularity in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, which will produce a similar irregularity in the barometer. Such accumulations will be formed over the north-western parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, and over North America; hence the barometer usually stands higher, and varies less there, than in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. Accumulations also are formed upon the Pyrenees, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALPS\">Alps</a>, the mountains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURKEY\">Turkey</a> in Europe, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARTARY\">Tartary</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIBET\">Tibet</a>. When these accumulations have gone on for some time, the density of the air becomes too great to be balanced by the surrounding atmosphere; it rushes down on the neighbouring countries, and produces cold winds which raise the barometer. Hence the rise of the barometer which generally attends north-east winds in Europe, as they proceed from accumulations in the north-west of Asia, or about the pole; hence, too, the north-west wind from the mountains of Tibet raises the barometer at Calcutta.\n\n* Irisf. Trans. vol. ii. p. 43; &c.\nWe shall presently endeavour to show, that considerable quantities of air are occasionally destroyed in the north polar regions. When this happens, the atmosphere to the south rushes in to supply the deficiency. Hence south-west winds take place, and the barometer falls.\n\nAs the mean heat of our hemisphere differs in different years, the density of the atmosphere, and consequently the quantity of equatorial air which flows towards the poles, must also be variable. Does this range correspond to the mean annual heat; that is to say, is the range greatest when the heat is least, and least when the heat is greatest? In some years greater accumulations than usual take place in the mountainous parts of the south of Europe and Asia, owing, perhaps, to earlier falls of snow, or to the rays of the sun having been excluded by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> fogs. When this takes place, the atmosphere in the polar regions will be proportionally lighter. Hence the prevalence of southerly winds during some winters more than others.\n\nAs the heat in the torrid zone never differs much, the density, and consequently the height, of the atmosphere, will not vary much. Hence the range of the barometer within the tropics is comparatively small; and it increases gradually as we approach the poles, because the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of the temperature, and consequently of the density, of the atmosphere, increases with the latitude.\n\nThe diurnal elevation of the barometer in the torrid zone corresponding to the tides, observed by Mr Caffon and others, must be owing to the influence of the moon on the atmosphere. This influence, notwithstanding the ingenious attempts of D'Alembert and several other philosophers, seems altogether inadequate to account for the various phenomena of the winds. It is not so easy to account for the tendency which the barometer has to rise as the day advances. Perhaps it may be accounted for by the additional quantity of vapour added to the atmosphere, which, by increasing the quantity of the atmosphere, may possibly be adequate to produce the effect.\n\nThe falls of the barometer which precede, and the oscillations which accompany, violent storms and hurricanes, show us that these phenomena are produced by very great rarefactions, or perhaps deflections of air, in particular parts of the atmosphere. The falls of the barometer, too, that accompany winds proceed from the same cause. The observation made by Mr Copeland, that a high barometer is accompanied by a temperature above the mean, will be easily accounted for by every one acquainted with Dr Black's theory of latent heat. The higher the mercury stands, the denser the atmosphere must be; and the denser it becomes, the more latent heat it must give out. It is well known that air evolves heat when condensed artificially. The falling of the barometer, which generally precedes rain, remains still to be accounted for; but we know too little about the causes by which rain is produced, to be able to account for it in a satisfactory manner.\n\nIt has been for some time suspected that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of the barometer is affected by the changes of the moon. The theory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> influence has been discussed on the continent chiefly by Lamarck and Cotte, (see Journal de Physique, p. 179); and in this country by Mr Luke Howard. Mr Howard's suspicions of this influence on the barometer were first conceived, in consequence of the printed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARTS\">charts</a>, of which he made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> in keeping a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> of the barometer, having the phases of the moon marked on them, and of his observing a remarkable coincidence between these and certain states of the mercury. This coincidence consists in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPRESSION\">depression</a> of the barometrical line on the approach of the new and full moon, and its elevation on that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>. In above 30 out of the 50 lunar weeks in the year 1798, the barometer was found to have changed its general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> once in each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>, in such a manner as to be either rising or at its maximum, for the week preceding and following, about the time of each quarter; and to be either falling or at its minimum, for the two weeks, about the new and full. It is remarkable, that the point of greatest depression during the year, viz. to 28.67, was found about 12 hours after the new moon on the 8th of November; and that at its greatest and extraordinary elevation to 30.89, on the 7th of February, at the time of the last quarter. Moreover, this coincidence appeared to take place most regularly in fair and moderate weather; and, in general, when the barometer fell, during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> between the new or full moon and the quarters, an evident perturbation in the atmosphere accompanied it; which may be inferred February 15 to 23, when the barometer, after an uncommon rise, continued to fall rapidly after the new moon, with severe cold, which ended suddenly in stormy and wet weather; again, June 14 to 20, when two weeks of fair weather ended in a thunderstorm. In the greater part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> the usual coincidence disappeared, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSE\">converse</a> took place; the barometer being low at the quarter and high at the full, amidst continual alternations of rain, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FROST\">frost</a>, and snow, and, for part of the time, high winds. On the two days preceding the last quarter, the barometer rose rapidly, and rain followed.\n\nOn the whole, Mr Howard thought there appeared sufficient ground, on the evidence of the year 1798, to suppose that the gravity of our atmosphere, as indicated by the barometer, may be subject to certain periodical changes, effected by a cause more steady and regular than either change of temperature, currents, or solution and precipitation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, to which he believes the whole variation has been heretofore attributed.\n\nThe mean of the register at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> appeared to be 29.89, whence it appears that the depression at the new and full moon either amounted to more, on the whole, than the elevations at the quarters, or that they fell out nearer to the time. He was quite satisfied, in passing through this register, that if he had allowed himself to choose the higher rotations about the quarters, and the lower about the new and full, with a latitude of 24 or 36 hours, it would have made the results as much more favourable to his conclusions as in her former case.\n\nNow, to omit the consideration of other proofs for the present, it appeared to him evident, that the atmosphere is subject to a periodical change of gravity, whereby the barometer, on a mean of ten years, is depressed at least one-tenth of an inch while the moon is passing from the quarters to the full and new; and elevated, in the same proportion, during the return to the quarter. To what causes shall we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> this periodical change, other than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> of the sun and moon for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> composing the atmosphere?\n\nThe atmosphere is a gravitating fluid, differing, in a physical\nThough there is a considerable difference in every part of the world between the temperature of the atmosphere in summer and in winter; though in the same season the temperature of almost every day, and even every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, differs from that which precedes and follows it; though the heat varies continually in the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> and seemingly capricious manner\u2014still there is a certain mean temperature in every climate, which the atmosphere has always a tendency to observe, and which it neither exceeds nor comes short of beyond a certain number of degrees. What this temperature is, may be known by taking the mean of tables of observations kept for a number of years; and our knowledge of it must be the more accurate the greater the number of observations is.\n\nThe mean annual temperature is greatest at the equator (or at least a degree or two on the north side of it), and it diminishes gradually towards the poles, where it is least. This diminution takes place in arithmetical progression, or, to speak more properly, the annual temperatures of all the latitudes are arithmetical means between the mean annual temperature of the equator and that of the pole. This was first ascertained by Mr Meyer; and Dr Kirwan improving on Meyer's hint, has calculated in the following table the mean annual temperature of every latitude between the equator and the pole. It must be remarked, however, that this table is calculated only for a particular part of the earth's surface, viz. that part of the Atlantic ocean which lies between the 80\u00b0 of northern, and the 45\u00b0 of southern latitude, extending westward as far as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GULF\">Gulf</a> stream, and to within a few leagues of the coast of America, and for all that part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PACIFIC_OCEAN\">Pacific ocean</a> that reaches from 45\u00b0 of north latitude to 45\u00b0 of south latitude, and extending between the 20th and 275th degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> east from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>. This part of the ocean is called by Dr Kirwan the standard, and was best suited to his purpose, as the rest of the ocean is subject to irregularities, which will be noticed presently (d).\n\n| Lat. | Temper. | Lat. | Temper. | Lat. | Temper. | Lat. | Temper. | Lat. | Temper. | Lat. | Temper. |\n|------|---------|------|---------|------|---------|------|---------|------|---------|------|---------|\n| 90   | 31      | 77   | 33.7    | 64   | 41.2    | 51   | 52.4    | 38   | 63.9    | 25   | 74.5    |\n| 89   | 31.24   | 76   | 34.1    | 63   | 41.9    | 50   | 52.9    | 37   | 64.8    | 24   | 75.4    |\n| 88   | 31.10   | 75   | 34.5    | 62   | 42.7    | 49   | 53.8    | 36   | 65.7    | 23   | 75.9    |\n| 87   | 31.14   | 74   | 35.0    | 61   | 43.5    | 48   | 54.7    | 35   | 66.6    | 22   | 76.5    |\n| 86   | 31.2    | 73   | 35.5    | 60   | 44.3    | 47   | 55.6    | 34   | 67.4    | 21   | 77.2    |\n| 85   | 31.4    | 72   | 36.0    | 59   | 45.9    | 46   | 56.4    | 33   | 68.3    | 20   | 77.8    |\n| 84   | 31.5    | 71   | 36.6    | 58   | 45.8    | 45   | 57.5    | 32   | 69.1    | 19   | 78.3    |\n| 83   | 31.7    | 70   | 37.2    | 57   | 46.7    | 44   | 58.4    | 31   | 69.9    | 18   | 78.9    |\n| 82   | 32.0    | 69   | 37.8    | 56   | 47.5    | 43   | 59.4    | 30   | 70.7    | 17   | 79.4    |\n| 81   | 32.2    | 68   | 38.4    | 55   | 48.4    | 42   | 60.3    | 29   | 71.5    | 16   | 80.4    |\n| 80   | 32.6    | 67   | 39.1    | 54   | 49.2    | 41   | 61.2    | 28   | 72.3    | 15   | 80.8    |\n| 79   | 32.9    | 66   | 39.7    | 53   | 50.2    | 40   | 62.0    | 27   | 72.8    | 14   | 81.3    |\n| 78   | 33.2    | 65   | 40.4    | 52   | 51.1    | 39   | 63.0    | 26   | 73.8    | 13   | 81.7    |\n\n(d) In calculating this table, Dr Kirwan proceeded on the following principle. Let the mean annual heat at the equator be $m$ and at the pole $m-n$; put $\\phi$ for any other latitude; the mean annual temperature of that latitude will be $m-n\\times\\sin.\\phi$. If, therefore, the temperature of any two latitudes be known, the value of $m$ and $n$ may be found. Now, the temperature of north latitude 45\u00b0 has been found by the best observations to be 62.1\u00b0, and\nDr Kirwan has also calculated in the following table the mean monthly temperature of the same standard (K).\n\n| Latitude | 80\u00b0 | 79\u00b0 | 78\u00b0 | 77\u00b0 | 76\u00b0 | 75\u00b0 | 74\u00b0 | 73\u00b0 | 72\u00b0 | 71\u00b0 | 70\u00b0 | 69\u00b0 | 68\u00b0 | 67\u00b0 | 66\u00b0 | 65\u00b0 | 64\u00b0 | 63\u00b0 | 62\u00b0 |\n|----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| Jan.     | 22.5| 23. | 23.5| 24. | 24.5| 25. | 25.5| 26. | 26.5| 27. | 27.5| 28. | 28. | 28. | 29. | 30. | 31. |\n| Feb.     | 23. | 23.5| 24. | 24.5| 25. | 25.5| 26. | 26.5| 27. | 27.5| 28. | 28.5| 29. | 30. | 31. | 32. | 33. |\n| March    | 27. | 27.5| 28. | 28.5| 29. | 29.5| 30. | 30.5| 31. | 31.5| 32. | 32.5| 33. | 33.5| 34. | 35. | 36. | 37. |\n| April    | 32.6| 32.9| 33.7| 34.1| 34.5| 35. | 35.5| 36. | 36.5| 37.2| 37.8| 38.4| 39.1| 39.7| 40.4| 41.2| 41.9| 42.7|\n| May      | 36.5| 36.5| 37. | 37.5| 38. | 38.5| 39. | 39.5| 40. | 40.5| 41. | 41.5| 42. | 42.5| 43. | 44. | 45. | 46. |\n| June     | 51. | 51.5| 52. | 52. | 52.5| 53. | 53.5| 54. | 54. | 54.5| 54.5| 55. | 55.5| 55.5| 55.5| 55.5| 56. |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a>     | 50. | 50.5| 51. | 51. | 51.5| 52. | 52.5| 53. | 53.5| 54. | 54.5| 54.5| 55. | 55.5| 55.5| 55.5| 55.5| 56. |\n| Aug.     | 39.5| 40. | 41. | 41.5| 42. | 42.5| 43. | 43.5| 44. | 44.5| 45. | 45.5| 46. | 46. | 47. | 48. | 48.5| 49. |\n| Sept.    | 33.5| 34. | 34.5| 35. | 35.5| 36. | 36.5| 37. | 38. | 38.5| 39. | 39.5| 40. | 40. | 41. | 42. | 43. | 44. |\n| Oct.     | 28.5| 29. | 29.5| 30. | 30.5| 31. | 31.5| 32. | 32.5| 33. | 33.5| 34. | 34. | 35. | 36. | 37. | 37.5| 38. |\n| Nov.     | 23. | 23.5| 24. | 24.5| 25. | 25.5| 26. | 26.5| 27. | 27.5| 28. | 28.5| 29. | 30. | 31. | 32. | 32.5| 33. |\n| Dec.     | 22.5| 23. | 23.5| 24. | 24.5| 25. | 25.5| 26. | 26.5| 27. | 27.5| 28. | 28. | 29. | 30. | 30.5| 31. | 32. |\n\nand that of latitude 50\u00b0, 52.9\u00b0. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of the sine of 40\u00b0 is nearly 0.419, and the square of the sine of 50\u00b0 is nearly 0.586.

From this last equation the value of \\( n \\) is found to be nearly 53; and \\( m \\) is nearly equal to 84. The mean temperature of the equator, therefore, is 84\u00b0, and that of the pole 31\u00b0. To find the mean temperature for every other latitude we have only to find 88 arithmetical means between 84 and 31.\n\n(E.) In calculating the table of mean monthly temperature, Dr Kirwan proceeded on the following principles. The mean temperature of April seems to approach very nearly to the mean temperature of the whole year, and as far as heat depends on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the solar rays, the mean heat of each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> may be considered as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a>...\nIt appears from the above table that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> is the coldest month in every latitude; that July is the warmest month in all latitudes above 48\u00b0; that in lower latitudes August is generally the warmest month; that the difference between the hottest and coldest months increases according to the distance of the place from the equator. All habitable latitudes are found to enjoy a medium heat of 60\u00b0 for at least 2 months, which is a very favourable circumstance, as probably no corn could be produced under a lower medium temperature. The temperatures within 10\u00b0 of the poles differ very little, nor do they differ much within 10\u00b0 of the equator. Hence it was unnecessary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> these latitudes in the table. The temperatures of different years vary but little near the equator, but this difference increases more and more as the latitudes approach the poles.\n\nIt is well known that the temperature of the atmosphere gradually diminishes according to the height of the place above the level of the sea. It was found by Dr Hutton of Edinburgh, that a thermometer kept on the top of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARTHUR\">Arthur</a>'s seat, a height of about 800 feet, usually stood 3\u00b0 lower than one kept at the foot of this hill; and Bouguer observed that on the top of Pinchincha, a height of about 15,564 feet, a thermometer stood 54\u00b0 lower than it did at the level of the sea in the same latitude.\n\nWe are indebted to Dr Kirwan for a very ingenious method of determining the rate of the diminution in the temperature in particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, having the temperature of the surface of the earth given. The temperature of the atmosphere constantly diminishing as we rise above the level of the sea, we must at a certain height arrive at a point where a perpetual congelation takes place. This point must vary in height according to the latitude, being highest at the equator, and coming gradually nearer the earth as we approach the poles; it must vary also with the season, being highest in summer, and lowest in winter. The cold on the top of Pinchincha was found by M. Bouguer to extend from 7\u00b0 below the freezing point every morning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> before sunrise; hence he concluded that between the tropics the medium height of the term of congelation (where it freezes at some part of the day all the year round) should be fixed at 15,577 feet above the level of the sea; but in latitude 28\u00b0, and during the summer, at 13,440 feet. If we take the difference between the temperature at the equator, and the freezing point, this difference will bear the same proportion to the term of congelation at the equator, that the difference between the medium temperature at any other latitude and the freezing point bears to the term of congelation at that latitude. Suppose the medium heat at the equator to be 84\u00b0, the difference between which and 32\u00b0 is 52\u00b0; and suppose the medium heat of latitude 28\u00b0 to be 72\u00b0, the difference between which and 32\u00b0 is 40\u00b0. Then by the following proportion, \\( \\frac{52}{15577} = \\frac{40}{13440} : \\frac{12}{72} \\), gives us the term of congelation at 28\u00b0. In this way Dr Kirwan proceeded in calculating the following table.\n\n| Lat. | 23\u00b0 | 22\u00b0 | 21\u00b0 | 20\u00b0 | 19\u00b0 | 18\u00b0 | 17\u00b0 | 16\u00b0 | 15\u00b0 | 14\u00b0 | 13\u00b0 | 12\u00b0 | 11\u00b0 | 10\u00b0 |\n|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| Jan. | 68  | 69  | 71  | 72  | 72.5| 73  | 73.5| 74  | 74.5| 75  | 76  | 76.5| 77  | 77.5|\n| Feb. | 72  | 72.5| 74  | 75  | 76  | 76.5| 77  | 77.5| 78  | 78.5| 79  | 79.5| 79.5| 79.5|\n| March| 75  | 75.5| 76  | 77  | 77.5| 78  | 78.5| 79  | 79.5| 80  | 80.5| 81  | 81.5| 81.8|\n| April| 78.5| 79  | 79.5| 80  | 80.5| 81  | 81.5| 82  | 82.5| 83  | 83.5| 84  | 84.5| 84.8|\n| May  | 78.5| 79  | 79.5| 80  | 80.5| 81  | 81.5| 82  | 82.5| 83  | 83.5| 84  | 84.5| 84.8|\n| June | 79  | 79.5| 80  | 80.5| 81  | 81.5| 82  | 82.5| 83  | 83.5| 84  | 84.5| 84.8| 84.8|\n| July | 79  | 79.5| 80  | 80.5| 81  | 81.5| 82  | 82.5| 83  | 83.5| 84  | 84.5| 84.8| 84.8|\n| Aug. | 79  | 79.5| 80  | 80.5| 81  | 81.5| 82  | 82.5| 83  | 83.5| 84  | 84.5| 84.8| 84.8|\n| Sept.| 78.5| 79  | 79.5| 80  | 81  | 81.5| 82  | 82.5| 83  | 83.5| 84  | 84.5| 84.8| 84.8|\n| Oct. | 75  | 75.5| 77  | 78  | 79  | 80  | 81  | 81.5| 82  | 82.5| 83  | 83.5| 84  | 84.8|\n| Nov. | 74  | 74.5| 75  | 75.5| 76  | 77  | 78  | 78.5| 79  | 79.5| 80  | 80.5| 80.8| 81  |\n| Dec. | 71  | 71.5| 72  | 72.5| 73  | 74  | 75  | 75.5| 76  | 76.5| 77  | 77.5| 78  | 78.5|\n\nAs the fine of the sun\u2019s mean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a> in April : the mean heat of April = the fine of the sun\u2019s mean altitude in May : mean heat of May.\n\nIn the same manner the mean heat of June, July, and August may be found; but for the temperature of the succeeding months we must take into consideration another circumstance, since the above rule would make the temperature of these months too low, as it does not take in the heat derived from the earth, which is nearly equal to the mean annual temperature. The real mean heats of these months must be considered as an arithmetical mean between the astronomical and terrestrial heats. Thus, for latitude 51\u00b0, the astronomical heat of September being 44.6\u00b0, and the mean annual heat 52.4\u00b0, the real heat of September ought to be \\( \\frac{44.6 + 52.4}{2} = 48.5 \\). Dr Kirwan, however, after going through a tedious calculation, found the results to correspond so little with actual observation, that he drew up the table partly from calculating from principles, and partly from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of several sea journals.\nThis last height of 120 feet M. Bouguer called the lower term of congelation. He also distinguished another term of congelation above which no visible vapour rises, and this he called the upper term of congelation. This line is considered by Kirwan as much less variable during the summer months than the lower line, and it has therefore been adopted by him to determine the rate of diminution in the temperature as we ascend into the atmosphere. He has calculated its height for every degree of north latitude in the following table.\n\n| N. Lat. | Feet | N. Lat. | Feet | N. Lat. | Feet | N.

Part II.\n\n(f) Dr Kirwan has given us the following rule for ascertaining the temperature at any required height, supposing we know the temperature of the surface of the earth.\n\nFor the temperature observed at the surface of the earth, put \\( m \\); for the given height \\( h \\), and \\( t \\) for the height of the upper term of congelation at the given latitude; then\n\n\\[\n\\frac{m - 32}{t} = \\text{the diminution of temperature for every 100 feet of elevation; or it is the common difference of the terms of the progression required.}\n\\]\n\nLet this common difference thus found be denoted by \\( c \\); then \\( c \\times \\frac{h}{100} \\) gives us the whole diminution of temperature from the surface of the earth to the given height. Let this diminution be denoted by \\( d \\), then \\( m - d \\) is obviously the\nM E T E O R O L O G Y.\n\n7. Moisture has a peculiar influence on it, if followed by a wind which disperses it.\n\n8. The greatest heat, and the greatest cold, take place about six weeks after the northern or southern solstice.\n\n9. The thermometer changes more in summer than in winter.\n\n10. The coldest period of the day is before sunrise.\n\n11. The greatest heat in the sun and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a> seldom takes place on the same day.\n\n12. The heat decreases with far more rapidity from September and October, than it increased from July to September.\n\n13. It is not true, that a very cold winter is the prognostic of a very hot summer.\n\nCHAP. III. Of the Changes which take place in the Air with respect to Evaporation and Rain.\n\nThere seems no reason to doubt that water exists in Qualities of the atmosphere in an intermediate state between that of vapour, a fluid and that of absolute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a>. This is the state of vapour, of the qualities of which it is proper that we should here take a general view.\n\nWe are indebted to the experiments of Saussure and de Luc for much of our knowledge of the qualities of vapour. It is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> invisible fluid like common air, but lighter; being to common air, according to Saussure, as 10 to 14, or, according to Kirwan, as 10 to 12; it cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> beyond a certain maximum of density, otherwise the particles of water which compose it unite together, and form small, hollow, visible vehicles, called vesicular vapour; which is of the same specific gravity with atmospheric air. It is of this vapour that clouds and fogs are composed. This maximum increases with the temperature; and at the heat of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> water is so great, that steam can resist the whole pressure of the air, and exist in the atmosphere in any quantity.\n\nAfter what has been stated under Chemistry with respect to the nature and properties of vapour, we have nothing here to add on that subject, except to give the result of observations that have been made on the state of vapour in the atmosphere.\n\nIt is found that the evaporation of water into the air Evaporation is confined entirely to the surface, and hence it is always proportional to the surface exposed to the action of the air. Accordingly, observation shows that in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> countries, and in marshy situations, in the neighbourhood of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, &c., the evaporation is much greater than in inland countries, and dry situations.\n\nIt is found that evaporation is greatest in hot weather; Proportionally to the temperature of the air, whence it must depend, in some degree, on the temperature of the air.\n\nthe temperature required. An example will make this rule sufficiently obvious. In latitude 56\u00b0 the heat below being 54\u00b0; required the temperature of the air at the height of 803 feet?\n\nHere \\( m = 54, t = 5533, \\frac{m - 32}{t} = \\frac{22}{54.33} = 0.404 = c \\), and \\( c \\times \\frac{h}{100} = 0.404 \\times 8.03 = 3.24 = d \\), and \\( m - d = 54 - 3.24 = 50.75 \\). Hence we see that the temperature of the air at the height of 803 feet above the surface is 50\u00b0.75.\nEvaporation and Rain.\n\nThis was ascertained by Mr Dalton from actual experiments, the result of which was, that the quantity evaporated per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> from a given surface of water at a given temperature, is to the quantity evaporated from the surface at $212^\\circ$, as the force of vapour at the given temperature is to the force of vapour at $212^\\circ$. By means of the table expressing the force of vapour at various temperatures given under Chemistry, p. 468, we may discover by the above rule the quantity of water at a given temperature lost by evaporation.\n\nThere are several circumstances that affect the quantity of vapour rising from water, even at the same temperature. Thus, we find that evaporation is least in calm weather, increases when there is wind, and is greater in proportion as the wind is stronger. This evidently arises from the agitation of the water, by which a new surface is perpetually exposed to the action of the air.\n\nWe shall here insert a table by Mr Dalton, expressing the quantity of vapour raised in various atmospheric temperatures, from a circular surface six inches in diameter.\n\n| Temperature | Force of vapour in inches | Evaporating force in grains |\n|-------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|\n| $212^\\circ$ |                          |                            |\n| 30          | .129                     | .52                        |\n| 120         | .67                      | .82                        |\n| 154         | .85                      |                            |\n| 189         | .54                      |                            |\n| 20          | .134                     | .56                        |\n| 21          | .71                      | .88                        |\n| 22          | .91                      |                            |\n| 23          | .73                      |                            |\n| 24          | .94                      |                            |\n| 25          | .79                      |                            |\n| 26          | .97                      |                            |\n| 27          | .82                      |                            |\n| 28          | .86                      |                            |\n| 29          | .90                      |                            |\n| 30          | .93                      |                            |\n| 31          | .99                      |                            |\n| 32          | .93                      |                            |\n| 33          | .97                      |                            |\n| 34          | .91                      |                            |\n| 35          | .95                      |                            |\n| 36          | .98                      |                            |\n| 37          | .92                      |                            |\n| 38          | .95                      |                            |\n| 39          | .98                      |                            |\n| 40          | .92                      |                            |\n| 41          | .95                      |                            |\n| 42          | .98                      |                            |\n| 43          | .92                      |                            |\n| 44          | .95                      |                            |\n| 45          | .98                      |                            |\n| 46          | .92                      |                            |\n| 47          | .95                      |                            |\n| 48          | .98                      |                            |\n| 49          | .92                      |                            |\n| 50          | .95                      |                            |\n| 51          | .98                      |                            |\n| 52          | .92                      |                            |","sp":312,"ep":323},{"h":"METEOROMANCY","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINATION\">divination</a> by meteors, principally by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a>.

The Popish Methodists were those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLEMICAL\">polemical</a> doc-\nII. The Protestant Methodists form a very considerable body in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> was founded in the year 1729 by one Mr Morgan and Mr John Wesley. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of November that year, the latter being then fellow of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINCOLN\">Lincoln</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a>, began to spend some evenings in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> the Greek New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>, along with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> Wesley student, Mr Morgan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONER\">commoner</a> of Christ <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, and Mr Kirkham of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MERTON\">Merton</a> college. Next year two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> three of the pupils of Mr John Wesley, and one pupil of Mr Charles Wesley, obtained leave to attend these meetings. Two years after they were joined by Mr Ingham of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a>'s college, Mr Broughton of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXETER\">Exeter</a>, and Mr James Hervey; and in 1735 they were joined by the celebrated Mr Whitefield, then in his 18th year.\n\nAt this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> it is said that the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of England was tending fast to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDELITY\">infidelity</a>. \"It is come (says Bishop <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTLER\">Butler</a>), I know not how, to be taken for granted by many persons, that Christianity is not so much as a subject of inquiry, but that it is now at length discovered to be fictitious; and accordingly they treat it as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> in the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> there were an agreement among all people of discernment, and nothing remained but to set it up as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> subject of mirth and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a>, as it were by way of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPRISALS\">reprisals</a>, for its having so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> interrupted the pleasures of the world.\" The Methodists are said, with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, to have been very instrumental in stemming this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORRENT\">torrent</a>. They obtained their name from the exact regularity of their lives; which gave occasion to a young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> of Christ church to say, \"Here is a new set of Methodists sprung up;\" alluding to a sect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> physicians which went by that name. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> regularity, however, soon brought a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> against them, perhaps not altogether without foundation, of being too scrupulous, and carrying their sanctity to too great a height. In particular it was urged, that they laid too much stress upon the rubrics and canons of the church, inflicted too much on observing the rules of the university, and took the scriptures in too literal a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>; and to the name of Methodists two others were quickly added, viz. those of Sacramentarians and the Godly Club.\n\nThe principal person in this club while in its infancy appears to have been Mr Morgan, and next to him Mr John Wesley. They visited the sick, and instituted a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> for the relief of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>; and the better to accomplish their benevolent designs, Mr Wesley abridged himself of all his superfluities, and even of some of the necessaries of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>; and by proposing the scheme to some gentlemen, they quickly increased their funds to \u00a350 per annum. This, which one should have thought would have been attended with praise instead of censure, quickly drew upon them a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a>; some of the seniors of the university began to interfere, and it was reported \"that the college censors were going to blow up the Godly Club.\"\n\nThey found themselves, however, patronised and encouraged by some men eminent for their learning and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>; so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, though they had suffered a severe loss in 1730 in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Mr Morgan, who had indeed been the founder of it. In the month of October 1735, John and Charles Wesley Methodists, Mr Ingham, and Mr D'lamotte set out for a merchant in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, embarked for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEORGIA\">Georgia</a> along with Mr Oglethorpe, afterwards General Oglethorpe. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of this voyage was to preach the gospel to the Indians. By this time, however, it appears that Mr Wesley had embraced such notions as may without the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a> be accounted fanatical. Thus in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> Samuel, he conjures him to banish from his school \"the classics with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POISON\">poison</a>, and to introduce instead of them such Christian authors as would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> together with him in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> up his flock in the knowledge and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of God.\"\n\nDuring the voyage such a profusion of worship was observed, as we cannot help thinking favoured more of a Pharisaical than Christian behaviour; an account of which, as a similar strictness would certainly be inculcated upon the disciples, and consequently must give a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> idea of the principles of the early Methodists, we shall here transcribe from Mr Wesley's life. \"From four in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> till five, each of us used private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a>; from five to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> we read the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIBLE\">Bible</a> together, carefully comparing it (that we might not lean to our own understandings) with the writings of the earliest ages; at seven we breakfasted; at eight were the public prayers; from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> to twelve learned the languages and instructed the children; at twelve we met to give an account to one another what we had done since our last meeting, and what we designed to do before our next; at one we dined; the time from dinner to four we spent in reading to those of whom each of us had taken charge, or in speaking to them separately as need required; at four were the evening prayers, when either the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> lesson was explained (as it always was in the morning), or the children were catechised and instructed before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONGREGATION\">congregation</a>; from five to six we again used private prayer; from six to seven I read in our cabin to two or three of the passengers, of whom there were about 80 English on board, and each of my brethren to a few more in theirs; at seven I joined with the Germans in their public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, while Mr Ingham was reading between decks to as many as desired to hear; at eight we met again, to instruct and exhort one another; between nine and ten we went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a>, when neither the roaring of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> nor the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the ship could take away the refreshing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> which God gave us.\"\n\nAs they proceeded in their passage, this austerity instead of being diminished was increased. Mr Wesley discontinued the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of wine and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>; confining himself to vegetables, chiefly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a> and biscuit. He ate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a>; and his bed having been made wet by the sea, he lay upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a>, and slept soundly till morning. In his Journal he says, \"I believe I shall not find it needful to go to bed, as it is called, any more;\" but whether this was really done or not, we cannot say.\n\nThe missionaries, after their arrival, were at first very favourably received, but in a short time lost the affections of the people entirely. This was owing to the behaviour of Mr Wesley himself, who appeared not only capricious but frequently defective. He particularly gave offence by insisting upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAPTISM\">baptism</a> of children by immersion; and his excessive austerity with regard to himself\nMethodists himself did not tend to give his hearers any favourable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> either of the superior sanctity or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> of their teacher. At last, on account of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> with Mr Caufton the storekeeper and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVANNAH\">Savannah</a> which ended in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a>, he was obliged to return to England.\n\nThus the cause of Methodism seemed to be entirely lost in Georgia. But Mr Wesley was soon succeeded by a more popular and successful champion, viz. Mr George Whitefield; who having spent his time during the voyage in converting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> with whom he sailed, arrived at Savannah in Georgia on the 7th of May 1738. Here he was received by Mr Delamotte, was joined by several of Mr Wesley's hearers, and became intimate with some other ministers. Mr Ingham had made some progress in converting a few runaway Creek Indians, who had a settlement about four miles from Savannah; but being obliged to return to England in a few months, this design was frustrated, and the Indians in a few years separated. During the short time that Mr Whitefield resided at Savannah, he became extremely popular; and indeed the influence of his success in the way of making converts are very surprising. However, he was obliged to return to England in the autumn of that year, that he might receive priestly orders. On his return to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> in October 1739, he landed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILADELPHIA\">Philadelphia</a>, and instantly began his spiritual labours as in other places; being attended with astonishing success not only there but wherever he went. Passing through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGINIA\">Virginia</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARYLAND\">Maryland</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> and South Carolina, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of converts continually increased; but on his arrival at Savannah, he found the colony almost deserted. He now resumed the scheme he had formerly projected of building an Orphan-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>; and for this he made the first collection at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLESTOWN\">Charlestown</a> in South Carolina, amounting to about \u00a320 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a>. His zeal in the cause of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, or of the colony, were not, however, sufficient to procure him the favour of those in power. On his return to Philadelphia, after a short stay at Savannah, the churches were denied him; but he was made ample amends by the success which attended his field preachings and private efforts. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">Religious</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a> were everywhere set up, and many were converted with symptoms of enthusiasm, different according to their various tempers and constitutions. During this excursion, he was so successful in his collection for the Orphan-house, that on his return to Savannah he brought along with him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> to the value of \u00a3500 sterling.\n\nThe success in Georgia was now greater than ever; but the many charities which it was necessary to supply, rendered it necessary in a short time for him to undertake another journey to Charlestown. Here his principles met with the greatest opposition. He had lost the favour of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSARY\">commissary</a> by his field-preaching, and was denied the sacrament. The opposition, however, was altogether fruitless; the number of converts increased wherever he went, and he now undertook a voyage to New England. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> also the established clergy were his enemies; but the usual success attended his other endeavours, and procured \u00a3500 more for the use of the orphans in Georgia.\n\nFrom the year 1741 to 1743 America was deprived of Mr Whitefield's preaching, he having spent that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> in England; but in 1744 he again set out for Methodists' western continent. The remarkable success which had hitherto attended his labours now stirred up many opponents; and these had met with the greater success, as none of the Methodist preachers whom he had left were possessed of such abilities either to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> the favour of those who heard them, or to defend their doctrines against objections. Mr Whitefield's success, however, was the same as before: he even found means to inspire the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> class with such sentiments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a>, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLONEL\">Colonel</a> Pepperell could not undertake his expedition against Louisbourg without first consulting Mr Whitefield; and great numbers of New-Englanders went volunteers, confident of victory, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the discourses of their teacher.\n\nFrom the continent of America Mr Whitefield took a voyage to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BERMUDAS\">Bermudas</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>; and here, as everywhere else, he met with the most surprising success. Here also collections were made for the Orphan-house in Savannah, which were transmitted to that place.\n\nSupposing it to be better for his cause to visit different countries, than to take up a permanent residence in one, Mr Whitefield left Bermudas in a few months, and did not return to America till 1751, when the Orphan-house was found to be in a very flourishing situation. After a short stay, he set sail again for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>. Here he remained two years, and then set out on another visit to America, landing at Charlestown on the 27th of May 1754. His presence constantly revived the spirits and cause of his party, and added to their numbers wherever he went. Next year he returned to England; but after labouring in the usual manner, and meeting with the usual success there till the year 1763, he set sail again for America, and arrived at Virginia in the latter end of August. He now visited all the colonies, and found that great progress had been made in converting the Indians. On his arrival at Georgia, matters were found in a very flourishing situation, and he received the thanks of the governor and principal people for the great benefit he had been to the colony; which shows, that the stories which had been so industriously propagated, concerning the avarice of him and other Methodist preachers, were, partly at least, unfounded. In 1765 he returned to England; and in 1766 made his seventh and last voyage to America, landing at Charlestown on the 30th of November the same year. He was still attended with the same success; and indeed it is impossible to read, without admiration, an account of the efforts made by himself and Mr Wesley, to propagate their tenets in the different parts of the world.\n\nFor a very considerable time Mr Whitefield was the only Methodist who paid any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to America; and in that country he was more popular than even in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. Towards the end of his life, several Methodists having emigrated from Britain, formed distinct societies in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEW_YORK\">New <a c</a>lass=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a> and Philadelphia. These quickly increased in number; and, about the time that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> with Britain began, their numbers amounted to about 3000 in Virginia, Maryland, New York, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENNSYLVANIA\">Pennsylvania</a>. They would probably have increased much more, had it not been for the imprudence of some of their preachers, who intro-\nintroduced politics into their discourses, and thus rendered themselves obnoxious to the people among whom they lived. Among those who hurt the cause in this manner was Mr Wesley himself, who, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> a piece entitled A Calm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">Address</a> to the American Colonies, would in all probability have ruined it, had not a gentleman, with whom he was connected, destroyed or sent back to England the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> as soon as it arrived in America, so that its existence was scarce known in that continent. At the conclusion of the war, Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COKE\">Coke</a>, who in 1776 had left a curacy in England in order to join Mr Wesley, paid a visit to his friends in America; though it had been imagined that a total separation had taken place between the American and European Methodists. This breach was, however, made up by a manoeuvre of Mr Wesley; for no sooner had the Americans obtained their independence, than he, who had hitherto branded them with the name of rebels, sent a congratulatory letter on their freedom from the \"State and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIERARCHY\">Hierarchy</a>,\" and exhorting them to \"stand fast in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> with which God had so strangely made them free.\" To show his zeal in their service still farther, he gave ordination, by laying on of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, to several preachers who were to embark for America, and consecrated Dr Coke one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a> of the Methodist Episcopal church in that country. He extracted also from the liturgy of the English church one for the American Methodists, taking particular care to expunge every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> that had a particular respect to the regal authority.\n\nSuch proceedings in one who had formerly professed such extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to the English church, could not but require an apology; and this was accordingly made in a pastoral letter transmitted to the American societies, and addressed \"To Dr Coke, Mr Atbury, and our brethren in North America.\" In this letter he makes the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of his conduct. \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a>'s account of the primitive church convinced me, many years ago, that bishops and presbyters are the same order, and consequently have the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to ordain. For many years I have been importuned, from time to time, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> this right, by ordaining <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of our travelling preachers. But I have still refused, not only for the sake of peace, but because I was determined, as little as possible, to violate the established order of the national church to which I belonged. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> is widely different between England and North America. Here there are bishops who have a legal jurisdiction; in America there are none, neither any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> ministers: so that for some hundred miles together, there is none either to baptize, or to administer the Lord's supper. Here, therefore, my scruples are at an end; and I conceive myself at full liberty, as I violate no order, and invade no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>'s right, by appointing and sending labourers into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a>. It has indeed been proposed to define the English bishops to ordain part of our preachers for America; but to this I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>. 1. I desired the bishop of London to ordain only one, but could not prevail. 2. If they consented, we know the looseness of their proceedings; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> admits of no delay. 3. If they would ordain them now, they would likewise expect to govern them; and how grievously would that entangle us. 4. As our American brethren are now to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TALLY\">tally</a> disentangled, both from the state and the English hierarchy, we dare not entangle them again either with the one or the other. They are now at full liberty simply to follow the scripture and the primitive church; and we judge it best, that they should stand fast in that liberty wherewith God has so strangely made them free.\"\n\nDr Coke, on the consecration of Mr Atbury to the office of a bishop, made another apology. \"The church of England (says he), of which the society of Methodists in general have till lately professed themselves a part, did for many years groan in America under grievances of the heaviest kind. Subjected to a hierarchy which weighs everything in the scale of politics, its most important interests were repeatedly sacrificed to the supposed advantages of England. The churches were in general filled with the parasites and bottle-companions of the rich and great. The humble and most unfortunate entreaties of the oppressed flocks, yea the representations of a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> itself, were contemned and despised. Everything sacred must bow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> at the feet of a party; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLINESS\">holiness</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> of mankind be sacrificed to their views; and the drunkard, the fornicator, and the extortioner, triumphed over bleeding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZION\">Zion</a>, because they were faithful abettors of the ruling powers. The memorable revolution has struck off these intolerable fetters, and broken the anti-christian union which before subsisted between church and state. And had there been no other advantage arising from that glorious epoch, this itself, I believe, would have made ample compensation for all the calamities of the war; one happy consequence of which was the expulsion of most of those hirelings, who \"ate the fat, and clothed themselves with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>, but strengthened not the diseased,\" &c. The parochial churches in general being hereby vacant, our people were deprived of the sacraments through the greatest part of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, and continue so still. What method can we take in so critical a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNCTURE\">juncture</a>? God has given us sufficient resources in ourselves; and, after mature deliberation, we believe that we are called to draw them forth.\n\n\"But what right have you to ordain?\" The same right as most of the churches in Christendom; our ordination, in its lowest view, being equal to any of the presbyterian, as originating with three presbyters of the church of England. \"But what right have you to exercise the episcopal office?\" To me the most manifest and clear. God has been pleased to raise me, by Mr Wesley, in America and Europe, a numerous society well known by the name of Methodists. The whole body have invariably esteemed this man as their chief pastor under Christ. He has constantly appointed all their religious officers from the highest to the lowest, by himself or his delegate. And we are fully persuaded there is no church office which he judges expedient for the welfare of the people intrusted to his charge, but, as essential to his station, he has power to ordain. \"But, do not you <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> the succession?\" The uninterrupted succession of bishops is a point that has long been given up by the most able Protestant defenders of episcopacy. Bishop Hoadley himself, in his celebrated controversy with Dr Calamy, allows it to be unnecessary. His words are, \"To the 13th question I answer, that I think not an uninterrupted line of succession...\"\nMethodists, cession of regularly ordained bishops necessary.' He also grants the authenticity of the anecdote given us by St Jerome, which informs us, that the church of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a> had no regular succession from the time of St Mark the evangelist, the first bishop of that church, to the time of Dionysius, a space of 200 years; but the college of presbyters, on the death of a bishop, elected another in his stead. We are also informed, from the epistle of St Clement to the Corinthians, written soon after the death of St Paul, a writer whose works are next in precedence to the canons of scripture, and probably written by immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSPIRATION\">inspiration</a>, that the church of Corinth was then governed only by a college of presbyters. And from the epistle of Polycarp to the church of Philippi, written in 116, we also find that the Christian Philippians were then governed only by a college of presbyters. So that the primitive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> were so far from esteeming the regular succession as essential to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of a Christian church, that, in some instances, episcopacy itself was wholly omitted.\n\nSuch was the defence urged by Mr Wesley for this extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">assumption</a> of episcopal powers: a conduct, however, of which he afterwards repented, as tending to make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> separation between his followers and the church of England. Yet it does not appear that this had any bad effect on the minds of his American brethren; for Dr Coke, on his arrival on the western continent, found the societies numerous and flourishing. His first efforts were directed against the slave trade; and not only the abolition of that traffic, but the release of all those who were actually slaves at the time, seem to have been his favourite objects. By interfering in this matter, however, perhaps with too much zeal, he involved himself in danger. Some riots took place, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> offered the mob 50 guineas if they would give the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a> 100 lashes. This piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> would have been inflicted, had it not been for the intervention of a sturdy colonel; and the Doctor had not only the satisfaction of escaping the intended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>, but of seeing his doctrine so far attended to, that some slaves were emancipated.\n\nMr Hanlon, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of Mr Wesley, observes, that \"the colonists, in the infancy of Methodism, conducted themselves with more propriety than the English. There was little or no persecution, nor anything like a riot, except in one or two instances which have been mentioned as the consequence of the anti-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a> laws; and even these were productive of no mischief. Not a creature was materially injured; no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> were broken, nor any lives lost; which was not the case in this country. Here many thousands of innocent people were subjected to the grossest indignities, and several were eventually sacrificed to the fury of their persecutors.\n\n\"While we commend the Americans for their behaviour in opposition to the brutality of English mobs, it may be proper to inquire into the sources of this distinction. Something of this may have arisen from similarity of sentiment. The Americans, from the first beginnings of colonization, had been accustomed to the doctrines of the old puritans and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NONCONFORMISTS\">nonconformists</a>, which in many respects have a near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> to the Methodist tenets. The origin of Methodism in America was seldom, if ever, attended, either under the discourses of Mr Whitefield's or Mr Wesley's preachers, with those ridiculous effects with which it was accompanied in these kingdoms. Most of the preachers, who went over to the continent, having laboured for some years in Europe previous to their having crossed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, had exhausted their wildfire; so that their discourses were more scriptural and rational than those of the primitive Methodists. Another reason may be found in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> of the Americans. As a people, they are better cultivated than the body of the English; they are chiefly composed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> and respectable yeomanry; and there is but a small proportion of that class, so superabundant here, which we distinguish by the name of mob.\n\n\"The only exception we have heard, to their exemption from the extravagancies which in this country marked the infancy of Methodism, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> they have introduced in Maryland and Virginia. Frequently, at the conclusion of a sermon, the whole congregation begin to pray and to praise God aloud. The uproar which this must create may easily be conceived. Some are told, are great admirers of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of enthusiasm, in which every man is his own minister, and one sings and another prays, with the most discordant devotion. But we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not dignify such indecency with such a name. Its proper appellation is fanaticism. We hope, that, for the future, religion will never appear in this country under so odious a form; and greatly is it to be lamented, that, among the friends of Christianity, any such affinities should arise, to furnish infidels with occasions of triumph.\"\n\nOur author informs us, that the occupation of the Methodist preachers in America was very laborious. In the course of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> they frequently rode 20 or 30 miles, preaching twice or thrice, and sometimes to considerable congregations. Notwithstanding this labour, however, few or none of them ever thought of returning to Britain. Several reasons may be assigned for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> they took in this laborious exercise. \"Their excursions (says Mr Hanlon) through immense forests abounding in trees of all sorts and sizes, were often highly romantic. Innumerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> and falls of water; vistas opening to the view, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> with the uncultivated wild; deer now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a> across the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>, and now scurrying through the woods, while the eye was frequently relieved by the appearance of orchards and plantations, and the houses of gentlemen and farmers peeping through the trees; formed a scenery so various and picturesque, as to produce a variety of reflection, and present, we will not say to a philosophic eye, but to the mind of every reasonable creature, the most sublime and agreeable images.\n\n\"Their worship partook of the general simplicity. It was frequently conducted in the open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. The woods resounded to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> of the preacher, or to the singing of his numerous congregations; while their horses, fastened to the trees, formed a singular addition to the solemnity. It was indeed a striking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a>; and might naturally impress the mind with a retrospect of the antediluvian days, when the hills and valleys re-echoed the patriarchal devotions, and a Seth or an Enoch, in the shadow of a projecting rock, or beneath the foliage...\"\nMethodists of some venerable oak, delivered his primeval lectures, and was a \"preacher of righteousness to the people.\"\n\nThe American <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITALITY\">hospitality</a> is supposed by Mr Hanson to have been another reason for the affluence of the Methodist teachers, as well as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> of being well employed, and the satisfaction resulting from considerations of public utility. As many of the preachers were men of fervent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>, this reflection would have its full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>; and the instruction of the ignorant and the reformation of the profligate would be considered as the best recompense of their labours. Spreading themselves through the continent, they took in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-NOVA_SCOTIA\">Nova Scotia</a>, Georgia, with the principal places in both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAROLINAS\">Carolinas</a>, Virginia, Maryland, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DELAWARE\">Delaware</a>, Pennsylvania, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEW_JERSEY\">New <a cla</a>ss=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERSEY\">Jersey</a>, and New York; numbering upwards of 43,000 members of their society, exclusive of about 80 itinerants, and a considerable number of local preachers, who took no circuits, but assisted occasionally in the neighbourhood of their respective residence.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> and expensive buildings which the colonists have erected for public worship, almost exceed credibility; and several colleges are founded for the instruction of youth. How far the proposed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of uniting genuine religion and extensive learning will be carried into execution, time only can discover. It must materially depend on the character of the presidents and tutors, and the provision that shall be made for their support. Men of real erudition will never be procured at low salaries; and it is in vain to attempt establishments of this sort without a liberal provision for the professors in every branch of science. Two of these places are called Cokebury and Wesley Colleges. How they are endowed, or whether they propose to obtain authority to confer degrees, we are not informed. But perhaps they are rather <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a> than colleges; which indeed is a circumstance to be wished, as good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GRAMMAR\">grammar</a> schools are of the utmost service to the progress of literature.\n\nThe great success which attended the Methodist preachers in America naturally determined Mr Wesley to try the West <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> islands. The Moravians had already attempted to establish their principles in some of these islands; and in 1786 some preachers were sent from the Methodists in England to the West Indies. In many of these they met with success. Societies were formed in Barbadoes, St Vincent's, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMINICA\">Dominica</a>, St Christopher's, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEVIS\">Nevis</a>, Antigua, St Eustatius, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TORTOLA\">Tortola</a>, and St Croix, amounting in all to near 5000 persons. At this time the whole number of Methodists in America and the West Indies amounted to about 48,302. These societies consisted both of whites and blacks; on the continent they were mostly whites, but in the islands <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NEGROES\">negroes</a>. \"But it is to be observed (says Mr Hanson) that the subjection of the negroes, and the obedience in which they are trained, must inculcate a docility peculiarly favourable to the purposes of a mission.\" Some of the missionaries went also to St Vincent's, where they met with some success, and have established some schools, in which their children are carefully instructed in the principles of religion.\n\n\"In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1789 (says our author), Dr Coke paid a visit to Jamaica, and gave them several sermons. As he made but a short stay, it could hardly be considered as a fair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>. Should a mission be established here, as well as in the other islands, which will probably be the case, it is hoped it will be the means of correcting one vice at least, and that is duelling; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> relic of Gothic barbarity, by which all the islands have for many years been distinguished. Perhaps too it will give some check to the spirit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> and dissipation; and teach the planters, if it be found impracticable to emancipate their slaves, at least to treat them with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>.\"\n\nIt has been debated among the leading men of the Methodistical profession, whether the cause might not be served by sending missionaries to the East Indies and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>; but these projects were dropped, as there was no invitation, nor any prospect of success if it had been adopted. A mission has been formed to the new settlement called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KENTUCKY\">Kentucky</a>, on the confines of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> territories, near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MISSISSIPPI\">Mississippi</a>. The danger of the missionaries at the time they undertook this service was certainly very great; yet such was their zeal for the cause, that they voluntarily offered themselves; but we are not yet informed what success they have met with.\n\nWhile Methodism was thus making rapid progress in America, its teachers were equally indefatigable in Britain. A most remarkable particular, however, occurs with regard to Mr Wesley himself; for though he had gone to Georgia, as has been already related, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> the Indians to Christianity, yet on his return to England in 1738, he took it into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> that he, their teacher, was not yet converted: the reason was, that he had not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> of assurance. This, however, was not long wanting. He arrived in England on the first day of February, and was blest with the assurance on the sixth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> following. This was immediately announced to the public; and the consequence, if we may believe him, was, that God then began to work by his ministry, which he had not done before. Being joined by one Kinchin, a fellow of Corpus, they travelled to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANCHESTER\">Manchester</a>, Holms Chapel, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEWCASTLE\">Newcastle</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFFORDSHIRE\">Staffordshire</a>, and other places, where they preached, exhorted, and conversed on religious subjects, in public houses, stables, &c., sometimes meeting with success and sometimes not. During this peregrination Mr Wesley certainly displayed a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>, which he must undoubtedly suppose to have been communicated to his hearers, and to have caused them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> on many occasions in a very ridiculous manner. An instance follows:\n\n\"The next day (says he), March 11th, we dined at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRMINGHAM\">Birmingham</a>, and, soon after we left it, were reproved for our negligence there (in letting those who attended us go without either exhortation or instruction) by a severe shower of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIL\">hail</a>!\" About the latter end of March or beginning of April he and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a> began to pray extempore, leaving off entirely the forms of the church of England, to which he had formerly been so devoted. The doctrine of instantaneous conversion, which his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> had suggested to him as a work performed on himself, was greedily received by some of his hearers; and all the converts to the new doctrine confirmed themselves, and contributed greatly to persuade others, by declarations of their experiences, as they called them: how-\nMethodists, ever, though a knowledge of the saving assurance had been given on March 6th, he does not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATE\">date</a> his conversion sooner than May 24th of the same year.\n\nThis new doctrine of an instantaneous, and in fact miraculous impulse, though greatly relished by the enthusiastic part of the society, was very much disliked by others, particularly Mr Charles Wesley his brother, who warned him of the mischief he was doing; though he himself was soon converted, and, what is very astonishing, two days before John Wesley himself. The particulars related of these miraculous conversions are truly disgraceful, and could not but bring into contempt the society which consisted of such enthusiasts. \"Many (says Mr Hanson) are represented as falling suddenly to the ground, in horror and agony not to be conceived, and rising again with equal expressions of peace and consolation.\"\n\nTheir conversions were usually attended with these violent symptoms; and, for several years, few meetings occurred where Mr Wesley presided, without one or more instances of the same kind. It was not possible that such translations should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> without notice. The confusion that too often prevailed, the emotions of the persons affected, and the exultations of the rest, which were feverishly animated upon, gave great and general offence. Many insisted, that it must either be occasioned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the rooms, and the agitation of the animal spirits under discourses of the most alarming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>; or that it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> artifice and hypocrisy.\n\nIn the meantime, two of the sons of a Mrs Hutton in London, happening to become converts to the new doctrine, this lady was so much offended, that she wrote to Mr Samuel Wesley, informing him, that she was of opinion his brother John had lost his senses; and requesting, that the next time he came to his house, he, Mr Samuel, would either confine or convert him. All that could be done, however, to prevent the progress of the new doctrine was insufficient; and the first Methodist society was formed in London on the first of May 1738, when about 50 agreed to meet together once a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>, for free conversation, begun and ended with singing and prayer.\n\nAll this time, however, it seems that the conversion of Mr Wesley was far from being so complete as that of many of his hearers. He had preached and converted others, while he himself was absolutely unconverted. The knowledge of the true saving faith was only revealed to him on the 6th of March, and he did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> its power till the 24th of May; and even after this, his doubts and fears were still so great, that on the 13th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> he undertook a voyage to Germany, where, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Zinzendorff, his faith seems to have been thoroughly confirmed.\n\nOn Mr Wesley's return, September 16th, 1738, he applied himself with the greatest fidelity and success to the propagation of his doctrine. Multitudes of converts were made in various parts of the kingdom; and the reproaches poured upon him by his opponents, seemed to have rendered his zeal more fervent if possible than before. It is remarkable, however, that some of his old friends were now so much offended with his conduct or his principles, that they absolutely refused to keep company with him. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> plan seems to have been, to make an union of Methodists, clergymen, and disseminate his principles by their means. But in this he succeeded so ill, that in a letter written in 1742, he wished for a clerical assistant, were he only in deacons orders: but adds, \"I know of none such, who is willing to call in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a> with us; and I scarce expect I shall, because I know how fast they are riveted in the service of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVIL\">devil</a> and the world before they leave the university.\"\u2014Finding at last that nothing could be done with them, he was obliged to have recourse to lay preachers; and easily selected those who appeared to have the greatest talents for prayer and exhortation in the private meetings appointed for that purpose. Thus he at once raised himself to be the head of a sect; as the lay preachers willingly yielded obedience to him who had the advantages of superior learning and abilities, and was besides in orders as a clergyman; and this obedience he did not fail on every occasion to exact.\n\nIf his doctrine had formerly given offence to the established clergy, the appointment of lay preachers was reckoned much worse; and their being appointed without any form of ordination whatever, which almost all of them were, subjected them to contempt and reproach, which their want of learning, and very often of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> abilities, did not contribute to remove. Thus finding the churches flat against him and his followers, he was obliged to preach in the fields, and made his first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSAY\">essay</a> in this way on the second of April 1739, in the neighbourhood of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRISTOL\">Bristol</a>; Mr Whitesfield having set him an example the day before.\n\nThe success of those ignorant and itinerant preachers, with their absurd and uncharitable discourses and behaviour, so provoked their adversaries, that a persecution was soon commenced against them. Mr Wesley himself was calumniated in the harshest manner, being sometimes said to be a Jesuit, sometimes an illiterate enthusiast, as the people took it into their heads. Many pretended to answer him in writing, without being able to do so: the consequence was, that their deficiency of argument was supplied by invective, and the most scandalous performances made their appearance. Some of the English clergy so far forgot themselves as to infligate the mob against them, and the most cruel outrages were committed upon them in various places. For some time the persecuted party adhered to the doctrines of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSIVE\">passive</a> obedience and nonresistance, which their inhuman adversaries did not fail to take the advantage of.\u2014The less they were opposed, the more insolent they became. The Methodists were frequently in danger of their lives. Men, women with child, and even children, were knocked down and abused with the same undistinguishing fury. Houses were stripped of their furniture, vast quantities of furniture carried off, featherbeds cut in pieces and strewn over the streets, several reputable people were forced into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, &c. To the disgrace of magistracy also it was found, that when application was made to the justices of the peace, redress was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> denied; nor was a stop put to these shameful proceedings without a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> mandate for the purpose.\n\nFrom the year 1738 to 1747 Mr Wesley and his itinerants were employed in various parts of England.\nMethodists. In 1747 he went over to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUBLIN\">Dublin</a>, where a society had been formed by one Mr Williams a clergyman.\u2014Here they proved so successful, notwithstanding the number of Papists, and the violence of their other opponents, that in 1750 they had erected meeting-houses in every part of the kingdom, and had formed 29 circuits, which employed 67 itinerants, besides a considerable number of local preachers. An invitation was given to Mr Wesley, in 1751, to visit Scotland, by an officer in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> at Muirfieldburgh. He accordingly took a journey thither the same year; but left the place, after preaching in it once or twice. In 1753 he returned to Scotland, and visited Glasgow. Societies were at length formed in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, as well as at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUNDEE\">Dundee</a>, Aberdeen, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERNESS\">Inverness</a>, and a few other places: but his success was by no means equal to what it had been in other parts; for in 1790 the number of circuits in Scotland was no more than eight, which were supplied by 20 itinerants.\n\nMr Whitefield, the other great labourer in the vineyard, was equally indefatigable, and probably more successful than Mr Wesley. Before entering into orders, he had formed a society of religious persons at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLOUCESTER\">Gloucester</a>; here he preached his first sermon on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">Necessity</a> and Benefit of Religious Society; here he became extremely popular, as well as at Bristol and London, while preparing to set sail for Georgia for the first time; and in all places to which he came, large collections were made for the poor. He maintained the same doctrine with Mr Wesley as to the new birth; which likewise gave offence to the clergy when delivered by him, as it had done with Mr Wesley. In the various intervals of his voyages to America, he employed himself with the very same affluence in Britain and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, which we have already taken notice of in the western continent. His success was everywhere prodigious. In 1741 he was invited to Scotland, and preached his first sermon there at Dunfermline. From thence he went to Edinburgh, and preached in several of the established churches, but differed with Messrs Ralph and Ebenezer Erskine; so that he, as well as Mr Wesley, proved unsuccessful in forming a coalition with any other religious party. In the private way, however, his success was very considerable, at Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee, and other places. In 1742 he paid a second visit to Scotland, and a third one in 1748. In 1751 he visited Ireland for the first time; and preached to great multitudes, without being molested, even in places where others had been mobbed. From thence he returned to Scotland the same year, and speaks in very favourable terms of the attention the people there paid to their Bibles. In 1752 and 1753 he again visited the same kingdom, and the last time distinguished himself by preaching against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-PLAYHOUSE\">playhouse</a> in Glasgow. In 1756 he returned; and by his animated discourses at Edinburgh against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POPERY\">Popery</a> and arbitrary power, was owned to have contributed very much to the increase of courage and loyalty in this country. Next year he again visited the Scottish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> during the time that the General Assembly sat, and his sermons were attended by several of the members. At Glasgow he made a large collection for the poor of that city, and from thence took a voyage to Ireland. He was received with the usual Methodist affection by the lower classes of Protestants; but the Popish rabble, exasperated at his success, almost murdered him with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>. After passing through a great part of Ireland, visiting England and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>, he paid another visit to Scotland, where four clergymen now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENT\">lent</a> him their pulpits. His last visit was in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> of 1758, when his congregations were as large as ever; and it is to his endeavours principally that we are to ascribe the great number of Methodist societies now existing in Scotland.\n\nWith regard to the religious principles of the Methodists, we cannot enter into any particular detail; neither indeed are there any doctrines peculiar to all included under that name, except the single one of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDEMPTION\">redemption</a>. In March 1741, Mr Whitefield being returned to England, entirely separated from Mr Wesley, and his friends, \"because he did not hold the &c. decrees.\"\u2014Here was the first breach, which warm men persuaded Mr Whitefield to make, merely for a difference of opinion. Those indeed who believed universal redemption, had no desire at all to separate; but those who held particular redemption, would not hear of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a>, being determined to have no fellowship with men that \"were in such dangerous errors.\" So there were now two sorts of Methodists so called; those for particular, and those for general, redemption.\n\nNot many years passed, before William Cudworth and James Relly separated from Mr Whitefield.\u2014These were properly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTINOMIANS\">Antinomians</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> avowed enemies to the law of God, which they never preached or professed to preach, but termed all legalists who did. With them, preaching the law was an abomination. They had nothing to do with the law. They would preach Christ, as they called it; but without one word either of holiness or good works. Yet these were still denominated Methodists, although differing from Mr Whitefield both in judgement and practice, abundantly more than Mr Whitefield did from Mr Wesley.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, Mr Venn and Mr Romaine began to be spoken of: and not long after Mr Madan and Mr Berridge, with a few other clergymen, who, although they had no connexion with each other, yet preaching <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SALVATION\">salvation</a> by faith, and endeavouring to live accordingly, to be Bible Christians, were soon included in the general name of Methodists. And so indeed were all others who preached salvation by faith, and appeared more serious than their neighbours. Some of these were quite regular in their manner of preaching: some were quite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>, (though not by choice; but necessity was laid upon them, they must preach irregularly, or not at all): and others were between both; regular in most, though not in all particulars.\n\nIn 1762, George <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELL\">Bell</a> and a few other persons began to speak great words. In the latter end of the year they foretold that the world would be at an end on the 28th of February. Mr Wesley, with whom they were then connected, withstood them both in public and private. This they would not endure: so, in January and February 1763, they separated from him, under the care of Mr Maxfield, one of Mr Wesley's preachers. But still Mr Maxfield and his adhe rents,\nMethodists rents, even the wildest enthusiasts among them, go under the general name of Methodists, and so bring a scandal upon those with whom they have no connexion.\n\nAt present, those who remain with Mr Wesley are mostly Church of England men. They love her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>, her homilies, her liturgy, her discipline, and unwillingly vary from it in any instance. Mean time, all who preach among them declare, we are all by nature children of wrath, but by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> we are saved through faith: saved from both the guilt and from the power of sin. They endeavour to live according to what they preach, to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> Bible Christians; and they meet together at convenient times, to encourage one another therein. They tenderly love many that are Calvinists, though they do not love their opinions. Yea, they love the Antinomians themselves; but it is with a love of compassion only, for they hate their doctrines with a perfect hatred; they abhor them as they do <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HELL\">hell</a> fire: being convinced nothing can so effectually destroy all faith, all holiness, and all good works.\n\nWe shall conclude this article with the words of Mr Hanson, which must certainly be accounted just, whatever objections may be made to some parts of the principles or behaviour of the Methodists. \"If they possess not much knowledge, which, however, we do not know to be the case, it is at least certain, they are not deficient in zeal: and without any passionate desire to imitate their example, we may at least commend their endeavours for the general good. Every good man will contemplate with pleasure the operation of the spirit of reformation, whether foreign or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a>; and will rejoice in every attempt to propagate Christianity in the barbarous parts of the world. An attempt which, if in any tolerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> successful, will do infinitely more for their civilization and happiness, than all the united energies of those boasted benefactors of mankind, the philosophic infidels.\"\n\nThe minutes of the last conference of the Methodists held at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEEDS\">Leeds</a> in August, 1806, represent the numbers of that society to be as follows:\n\n| Location                  | Number       |\n|---------------------------|--------------|\n| Great Britain             | 110,803      |\n| Ireland                   | 23,773       |\n| Gibraltar                 | 40           |\n| Nova Scotia, New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUNSWICK\">Brunswick</a>, and Newfoundland | 1,418       |\n| West Indies, whites 1775, coloured people | 13,165       |\n| United States, whites 95,628, coloured people | 14,940       |\n|                           | 24,316       |\n| Total                     | 119,945      |\n\nMethodists (Methodici), in the history of medicine, a sect of ancient physicians, who reduced the whole art of healing to a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> principles or appearances.

He early discovered a fondness for polite literature and the sciences; and went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORLEANS\">Orleans</a> with the son of Barneveldt, whom he accompanied in his travels. In 1610 he was made professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a>, and afterwards Greek professor. In the following year, the magistrates of the United Provinces proved how <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> was of his abilities, by fixing on him to write the history of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. Meurinus married in the year 1612. His wife, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNA\">Anna</a> Catherina Bilberbeccia, descended from a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and noble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> in Angermund a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Pomerania, possessed many amiable qualities, and rendered his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> remarkably happy, while he discharged the duties of his professorship with an assiduity equal to his abilities. At the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> the republic of letters did not lose the advantages to be derived from his labours; for during the fourteen years of his residence at Leyden, the works which he published were more numerous than those which had been presented to the world by the whole body of professors from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> foundation of the university in 1575.\n\nMeurinus's writings had now spread his reputation in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>; nor was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> of his diligence and talents as a professor less known. In so high a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, indeed, did he stand among his literary contemporaries, that Christian IV, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a> conferred on him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of historiographer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a>, and invited him to undertake the professorship of history and politics in the academy of Sora, which was founded by King Frederick II., although the revival of its honours and dignities may be dated from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, when it seemed to be again founded under the auspices of Christian IV. Meurinus and his family left Leyden in the year 1635. On his arrival at Sora, he was received with the most friendly tokens of regard by his majesty and the Danish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>, and more particularly by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">Chancellor</a> Rolenkrantz, on whom he has bestowed very ample praises in one of his letters. Here he resided, equally beloved and admired, for above twelve years. His pupils were not very numerous, but his exertions never relaxed. Those hours likewise which were not devoted to the duties of his professorship, he employed in reviling the works of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> and in philological disquisitions.\n\nHis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> did not suffer by the intenseness of application, till in the year 1638 he had a violent attack of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, from which disorder he had suffered severely. In a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to Voissius he thus describes his melancholy condition: \"The state of my health during the whole of the last winter has been truly deplorable. My sufferings from the stone have been really\nMeurifus really dreadful. I have voided so many, that the repeated discharges brought on a wound which emitted blood for above four months. I was next attacked by a tertian fever, which increased constantly, and produced an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> latitude of body, a dejection of spirits, and a total loss of appetite. But, thank <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>, I have now in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> recovered my strength, and gotten the better of these complaints.\" He recovered from this attack; but in the following year the disorder returned with redoubled violence, and brought on a consumption which terminated his existence on the 20th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of September 1639. He left behind him a son who was named after him, and one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a>.\n\nSo mild were the dispositions of Meurifus, that in all his writings he constantly avoided literary disputes. He was sometimes unavoidably drawn into them; but constantly endeavoured to promote a reconciliation rather than widen any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a>, by his replies to the attacks of his adversaries. In his friendships he was firm and affectionate. Of his domestic life, whatever is known has been gathered from his letters. The same easy tranquillity seems to have attended him in every situation. In his family he was particularly fortunate. In his son, to whom he gave his own name, he seemed to behold his own youth renewed. The same application, the same eagerness in the pursuit of knowledge, marked the conduct of this promising young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>; who did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> survive his father, but died soon after he had recommended himself to the notice of the learned world by his publications. They were only three in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>; but displayed so much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> learning, that they have been assigned to the father, John Meurifus, by l'Abb\u00e9 Beughem and others. This mistake was occasioned as much by the multiplicity of their names, as by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of their works, and their manner of treating philological subjects.\n\nHis works may be divided into four classes, of which each might form a separate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they were ever to be republished. Meurifus himself indeed, in one of his letters to Voelius, proposes such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>. From that epistle, and from another which the younger Meurifus sent to G. J. Voelius, who strongly advised him to republish the whole of his father's writings, and from the collections of his posthumous works which have appeared from Struvinus, Grochupius, Moller, and some others, a catalogue of his works might be formed. Some assistance <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> also be derived from the indexes published in their respective works, by Hankins, Desfelius, Wettenuis, and Bartholomius. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> which Meurifus recommends for publishing his works, is to insert in the first volume all that he has written relative to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>; in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, his historical pieces; in the third, his miscellaneous dissertations; and in the fourth, the various authors which he published, with his notes and corrections.\n\nA scandalous and indecent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, which is entitled \"Meurifus elegantiae Latini sermonis,\" and has \"Aloisia Sigae Satyrae Sotadicae\" annexed to it, is very falsely attributed to Meurifus; nor indeed are the Satires with more reason assigned to Aloisia Sigae, who was a Spanish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> eminent for her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>. The real author of these infamous productions was Westrenius, an advocate at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPENHAGEN\">Copenhagen</a>, who probably assumed the name of Meurifus, in order to shield himself from the disgrace which would naturally have attended the writer of such a performance.","sp":352,"ep":353},{"h":"MEVANIA","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">Ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">Geography</a>, a town of the Cispennine Umbria; seated at the confluence of the Tina and Clitumnus, on the Via Flaminia, famous for its herds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> cattle brought up there for sacrifice; the white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> said to be owing to the waters of the Clitumnus (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a>).

They were expelled, as we are told, from their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> (supposed by Clavigero to have been Tollan, to the northward of Mexico) in the year 472; and for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> led a wandering <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. In whatever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> they determined to reside for any considerable time, they erected houses and cultivated the ground. Thus their migrations were extremely slow, and it was not till 104 years after they set out that they reached a place about 50 miles to the eastward of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Mexico, where they settled for 20 years, giving to their new place of residence the name of Tollanzinco. From thence they proceeded about 40 miles farther to the west, where they built a city called, from the name of their country, Tollan, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TULA\">Tula</a>.\n\nAfter the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> settlement of the Toltecan, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> was changed into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a>. Their first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> began his reign in 667, and their monarchy lasted 384 years, during which time they reckon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> eight princes. We are not, however, to imagine that each of their kings lived <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> enough to make up this space. It was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> among them that the name of the king should be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for 52 years, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> longer, from the time he ascended the throne. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> he died within that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, the government was carried on in his name by a regency; if he survived, he was obliged to resign his authority. During the four centuries that the Toltec monarchy continued, they had increased very considerably in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, and had built many cities; but when in the height of prosperity, almost the whole nation was destroyed by a famine occasioned by drought; and a pestilence, probably the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the former. According to Torquemada (says our author), at a certain festival-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> made by the Toltecan, the sad-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVIL\">devil</a> appeared to them of a gigantic size, with immense arms, and in the midst of the entertainment he embraced and suffocated them; that then he appeared in the form of a child with a putrid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>,\nMexico and brought the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a>; and, finally, at the persuasion of the same devil, they abandoned the country of Tula.\"\n\nThey were succeeded by the Chichemecas, a much more barbarous people, who came from an unknown country called Amaquemecan, where they had for a long time resided; but of which no traces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a> can be found among any of the American nations known to Europeans; so that Clavigero supposes it must have been very far to the northward.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> which the Chichemecas had for leaving their own country is not known. They were eighteen months on their journey, and took possession of the defoliate country of the Toltecas about a hundred years after the former had left it. They were much more uncivilized than the Toltecs; but, however, had a regular form of monarchical government, and in other respects were less disgusting in their manners than some of the neighbouring nations. The last king who reigned in Amaquemecan before the departure of the Chichemecas, had left his dominions between his two sons Auchcauhli and Xolotl, and the latter conducted the new colony. Having proceeded from the ruins of Tula towards Chempolla and Tepepolio, Xolotl sent his son to survey the country. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> crossed the borders of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> which surround the vale of Mexico; then ascending to the top of a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> one, he viewed the whole country, and took possession of it in the name of his father, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a> four arrows to the four winds.\n\nXolotl being informed by his son of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the country, chose for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of his kingdom Tenayuca, about six miles to the northward of the city of Mexico, and distributed his people in the neighbouring territory; but as most of them went to the northward, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> obtained the name of the country of the Chichemecas, in distinction from the rest. Here a review of the people was taken, and their number, according to Torquemada, was more than a million.\n\nXolotl finding himself peacefully settled in his new dominion, sent one of his officers to explore the sources of some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> of the country. While performing this task he came to the habitations of some Toltecans, who it seems had still kept together, and were likely once more to become a nation. As these people were not inclined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, and greatly esteemed for their knowledge and skill in the arts, the Chichemecas entered into a strict <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> with them, and Prince Nopaltzin, who had first surveyed the country, married a Toltec princess. The consequence of this alliance was the introduction of the arts and knowledge of the Toltecans among the Chichemecas. Till now the latter had subsisted entirely by hunting, and such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> and roots as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> spontaneously produced. They were clad in the skins of wild beasts, and, like these beasts, they are said to have sucked the blood of the animals they caught; but after their connection with the Toltecans they began to sow corn, to learn the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGGING\">digging</a> and working <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>, to cut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, manufacture cotton, and, in every respect, to make great improvements.\n\nWhen Xolotl had reigned about eight years in his new territories, an embassy of six persons arrived from a distant country not far from Amaquemecan, expressing a desire of coming with their people to reside in the Mexico country of the Chichemecas. The king gave them a gracious reception, and assigned them a district; and, in a few years after, three other princes, with a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> of Acolhuans, who were likewise neighbours of Amaquemecan, made their appearance. The king was at that time at Tezcuco, to which place he had removed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>; and here he was accosted by the princes, who, in a submissive and flattering manner, requested him to allow them a place in his happy country, where the people enjoyed such an excellent government. Xolotl not only gave them a favourable reception, but offered them his two daughters in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>, expressing his concern that he had no more, that none might have been excluded from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> alliance. On the third prince, however, he bestowed a noble virgin of Chalco, in whom the Toltec and Chichemecan blood were united. The nuptials were celebrated with extraordinary pomp; and the two nations, after the example of the sovereigns, continued to intermarry. As the Acolhuans were the more civilized nation of the two, the name of Chichemecas began to be appropriated to the more rude and barbarous part, who preferred hunting to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>, or chose a life of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> in the mountains to the restraints of social laws. These barbarians associated with the Otomies, another savage nation who lived to the northward, occupying a tract of more than three hundred miles in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>; and by their descendants the Spaniards were harassed for many years after the conquest of Mexico.\n\nAs soon as the nuptial rejoicings were over, Xolotl divided his territories into three parts, assigning one the domain of each of the princes. Acolhuatzin, who had married his eldest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a>, had Azocopazcalo, 18 miles Xolotl to the westward of Tezcuco; Chiconquauhtli, who married the other, had a territory named Xaltocan; and Tzontecomatl, who married the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> of inferior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, had one named Coatlichan. The country continued for some time to flourish, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> increased greatly, and with it the civilization of the people; but as these advanced, the vices of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> and ambition increased in proportion. Xolotl found himself obliged to treat his subjects with more severity than formerly, and even to put some of them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>.\u2014This produced a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a> against him, which, however, he had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a> to escape; but while he meditated a severe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> on the conspirators, he was seized with the distemper of which he died, in the fortieth year of his reign, and in a very advanced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>.\n\nXolotl was succeeded by his son Nopaltzin, who at the time of his accession is supposed to have been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> about sixty years of age. In his time, the tranquillity of the kingdom, which had begun to suffer disturbance under his father, underwent much more violent shocks, and civil wars took place. Acolhuatzin, the only one of the three princes who remained alive, thinking the territory he possessed too narrow, made war upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> of a neighbouring province named Tapotzotlan, and deprived him of his territory. Huetzin, son to the late Prince Tzontecomatl, lord of Coatlichan, fell in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a>-daughter of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a>, a celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, but was rivalled by a neighbouring lord, who determined to support his pretensions.\npretensions by force of arms. Huetzin, however, got the better, defeated and killed his adversary, and then possessed himself of the lady and his estate. This was followed by a rebellion of the whole province of Tolantzinco, so that the king himself was obliged to take the field. As the rebels were very numerous, the royal army was at first defeated; but having at last received a strong reinforcement, the rebels were overcome, and their ringleaders severely punished. The king did not long survive the restoration of tranquillity to his dominions. He died in the thirty-second year of his reign, and ninety-second of his age, leaving the throne to his eldest son Tlozotzin, who was an excellent prince, and reigned thirty-six years.\n\nQuinatzin, the son and successor of Tlozotzin, proved a vain and luxurious prince. His accession to the throne was celebrated with much greater pomp than any of his predecessors. Xolotl had removed his court from Tenayuca to Tezcoco; but being disgusted with this last place, on account of the conspiracy formed against him there, he had returned to Tenayuca.\u2014There the court continued till the reign of Quinatzin, who removed it back to Tezcoco.\n\nThe reign of Quinatzin, though tranquil at first, was soon disturbed by dangerous revolts and rebellions. These first broke out in two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, named Maztiztlan and Totopetl, situated among the northern mountains. The king, having collected a great army, marched without delay against the rebels, and challenged their leaders to come <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> and fight him in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>.\u2014This challenge being accepted, a furious engagement ensued, in which, though great numbers fell on both sides, no decisive advantage was gained by either party. Frequent engagements took place for the space of forty days, until at last the rebels, perceiving that their own numbers were daily diminishing, without any possibility of being recruited like the royal army, made a final surrender to the king, who punished the ringleaders with great severity. Tranquillity, however, was not yet restored; the rebellion spread to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, that the king was obliged not only to take the field in person, but to employ six other armies, under the command of faithful and experienced generals, to reduce the rebels. Those proved so successful in their enterprises, that in a short time the rebellious cities were reduced to obedience, and the kingdom enjoyed the blessings of peace during the long reign of Quinatzin, who is said to have sat on the throne for no less than sixty years. He was succeeded by his son Techotlatla; but as the affairs of the Acolhuans now began to be connected with those of the Mexicans, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be proper to give some account of that people.\n\nThe Mexicans, called also the Aztecas, dwelt till the year 1160 in a country called Aztlan, situated to the north of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALIFORNIA\">California</a>, as appears by the route they pursued in their journey; but how far to the northward we are not certainly informed. Betancourt makes it no less than 2700 miles, and Boturini says it was a province of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>. The cause of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIGRATION\">migration</a> is said to have been as follows:\n\nAmong the Aztecas was a person of great authority, named Huiztilin, to whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> every one paid the utmost deference. He had conceived a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> to persuade his countrymen to change their residence; and to effect this he fell upon the following stratagem. Having heard, while meditating on his scheme, a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a> fingering on the branches of a tree, the notes of which resembled the word Tilhui, which in the Azteca <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> signified \"let us go,\" he took that opportunity to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> of the people. With this view, he took along with him a respectable person, and made him attend to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> of the bird. \"What can it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> (says he), but that we must leave this country, and find ourselves another? Without doubt it is the warning of some secret <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a> who watches over our welfare: let us obey, therefore, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>, and not draw his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a> upon us by a refusal.\" Tecpaltzin, for that was the name of his friend, readily agreed to the interpretation; and both of them being persons of great influence, their united persuasions soon gained over to their project the bulk of the nation, and they accordingly set out.\n\nThe Aztecas, when they left their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> habitations, were divided into six tribes; but at Culiacan the tribes, the Xochimilcas, Tepanecas, Chalceles, Tlahuicas, and en image Tlacelalans. The cause of this separation is not known, but it was probably occasioned by some disagreement among themselves; for the remaining <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> was divided into two violent factions, which persecuted one another: neither did they afterwards construct any more edifices. However, they always travelled together, in order to enjoy the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of their imaginary god. At every place where they stopped an altar was erected to him; and at their departure they left behind them all their flocks, and probably also some others to take care of them, or such as were not willing to endure the fatigue of farther journeys. They flopped in Tula <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> years, and eleven more in the neighbouring parts. At last, in 1216, they arrived at Zumpango, a considerable city in the vale of Mexico, where they were received in a very hospitable manner by the lord of that district. He not only assigned them proper habitations, but became very much attached to them; and even demanded from among them a wife for his son Ilhuicatl. This request was complied with; and from this marriage all the Mexican kings descended.\n\nThe Mexicans continued to migrate from one place to another along the lake of Tezcoco. Xolotl, who was then on the throne of the Acolhuans or Chichimecas, allowed them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> in whatever places of his dominions they thought proper; but some of them finding themselves harassed by a neighbouring lord, the Mexicans were obliged, in 1245, to retire to Chapalotepec, a mountain on the western borders of the lake, scarcely cutted, two miles distant from the site of Mexico. This took place in the reign of Nopaltzin, when disturbances began to take place in the Acolhuans' dominions. The Mexicans, however, did not find themselves any more secure in their new place of residence than formerly; they were persecuted by the neighbouring lords, and obliged to take refuge in a number of small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>, named Acoocoleo, at the southern extremity of the lake of Mexico. Here for 52 years they lived in the most miserable manner, subsisting on fish, insects, roots, &c., and clothing themselves with the leaves of the amoxtli, which abounds in that lake.\n\nIn this miserable plight the Mexicans continued till the year 1314, when they were reduced to a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a>.\nthe most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> slavery. This was done by the king of a petty state named Colhuacan, who, it is said, being unwilling to allow the Mexicans to maintain themselves in his territories without paying tribute, made war upon them, subdued and enslaved them. Others affirm that, pretending compassion for their miserable situation, he offered them a more commodious place of residence; The Mexicans readily accepted the offer; but had scarcely set out to take possession of their new place of residence when they were attacked by the Colhuans, made prisoners, and carried off for slaves.\n\nAfter some years a war broke out between the Colhuans and Xochimilcas, in which the latter gained such advantages, that they were obliged to employ their slaves to assist them. They accordingly ordered them to prepare for war, but without furnishing them with arms necessary for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> enterprise; so that the Mexicans were obliged to content themselves with long spears, having their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> hardened in the fire; they also made knives of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> itztil, and shields of reeds woven together. They agreed not to waste their time in making prisoners, but to content themselves with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> off one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a> of their enemies, and then leaving them without farther injury. They adhered punctually to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>; and rushing furiously upon the Xochimilcas, cut off an ear from as many as they could, killing those who struggled to such a degree that they could not effect their purpose. In short, so well did the Mexicans acquit themselves in this engagement, that the Xochimilcas fled, and took refuge among the mountains. After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>, the Colhuan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> presented themselves before their general with the prisoners they had taken, by the number of which alone they judged of their valour. The Mexicans had taken only four, and these they kept concealed for the abominable purpose of sacrificing them. The Colhuans, therefore, seeing no trophies of their valour, began to reproach them with cowardice; but the Mexicans, producing their baskets of ears, defied them to judge from these how many prisoners they might have taken, had they not been unwilling to retard their victory by taking up time in binding them.\n\nNotwithstanding the valour displayed by the Mexicans in this engagement, it doth not appear that their haughty masters were in the least inclined to afford them easier terms than before. Having erected an altar to their god, they demanded of their lord something precious to offer in sacrifice to him; but he in disdain sent them a dirty cloth, enclosing the filthy carcass of a vile bird. This was carried by Colhuan priests; and without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> laid upon the altar. The Mexicans, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> unconcern, removed this filthy offering, and put in its place a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a> made of itztil, and an odoriferous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERB\">herb</a>. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of consecration, the Colhuan prince attended with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>; not with a view to do <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to the festival, but to make a mockery of the Mexicans. Their derision, however, was soon changed into horror, when the Mexicans, after a solemn dance, brought forth the four Xochimilcan prisoners they had taken; and, after having made them dance a little, cut open their breasts with the knife which lay on the altar, and plucking out their hearts, offered them, while yet palpitating with life, to their diabolical idol. This had such an effect upon the spectators, that both king and subjects desired the Mexicans immediately to quit their territories and go where they pleased. This order was instantly obeyed; the whole nation took their route towards the north, until they came to a place named Acatezintlan, situated between two lakes, and afterwards named Mexicozinteco; but for some reason or other, being discontented with this situation, as indeed they seem very often to have been, they proceeded to Ixtacalco, still nearer to the site of Mexico. Here they formed the image of a little mountain of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, and danced round it a whole night, singing their victory over the Xochimilcas, and returning thanks to their god for having freed them from the yoke of the Colhuans. Clavigero is of opinion, that by this mountain they represented Colhuacan, as in their pictures it was always represented by a hunch-backed mountain; and this is the literal signification of the name.\n\nThe city of Mexico was founded in the year 1325. The city of Mexico in the most commodious situation we can imagine, viz., on a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> named Tenochtitlan, in the middle of a great lake, without ground to cultivate for their subsistence, or even room sufficient to build their habitations. Their life was therefore as miserable here for some time as it had been when they were on the islands at the end of the lake, and they were reduced to the same shifts to maintain themselves. To enlarge the boundaries of their island, they drove palisades into those parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> which were most shallow, terracing them with stones and turf, and uniting to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> island several other smaller ones which lay in the neighbourhood. To procure to themselves afterwards stones, wood, &c., for constructing their habitations, as well as clothing and other necessaries, they instituted a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> with the people who dwelt on the borders of the lake, supplying them with fish, waterfowl, and other more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> inhabitants of the lake and marshes, which they contrived to render eatable; and in return for all this they received the necessaries above mentioned. The greatest effort of their industry, however, was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of floating gardens, by means of bushes and the mud of the lake; and these they brought to such perfection that they produced maize, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEPPER\">pepper</a>, chia, French beans, and gourds.\n\nFor thirteen years that the Mexicans had struggled with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> difficulty, they remained at peace; but factions soon after did they begin to prosper and live comfortably, than the inveterate enmity between the two factions broke out in all its fury. This produced a separation; and one of the parties took up their residence on a small island at a little distance to the northward, which, from a heap of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> found there, they at first named Xaltelolco, but afterwards Tlatelolco, from a terrace constructed by themselves. This island was afterwards united to that of Tenochtitlan.\n\nAbout this time the Mexicans divided their city into four parts, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> which still subsists; each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> having now its tutelar saint, as it had formerly its tutelar god. In the midst of their city was the sanctuary of their great god Mexiltli, whom they constantly preferred to all the rest. To him they daily performed acts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADORATION\">adoration</a>; but instead of making any progress in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>, they seem to have daily improved in the most horrible barbarities, at least in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>. The dreadful sacrifices made of their prisoners, could only be exceeded by that which we are now about to relate.\nBeing now on a more respectable footing than formerly, they sent an embassy to the petty king of Colhuacan, requesting him to send them one of his daughters, that she might be consecrated the mother of their protecting god. The unsuspecting prince readily complied with their desire. The unfortunate princess was conducted in great triumph to Mexico; but no sooner was she arrived, than she was sacrificed in a shocking manner; and, to add to the horror of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEED\">deed</a>, the body was flayed, and one of the bravest young men of the nation draped in her skin. Her father, ignorant of this dreadful transaction, was invited by the Mexicans to be present at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOTHEOSIS\">apotheosis</a> of his daughter, and went to see the solemnity, and to worship the new divinity. He was led into the sanctuary, where the young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> stood clothed in the bloody skin of his daughter; but the darkness of the place prevented him from seeing what was before him. They gave him a censer in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPAL\">copal</a> to begin his worship; but having discovered by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> of the copal the horrible spectacle, he ran out in a distracted manner, calling upon his people to revenge the injury; but this they were not able to do at that time nor ever after.\n\nIn the year 1352 the Mexican government was changed from an aristocracy to a monarchy. At first they were governed by 20 lords, of whom one had an authority superior to the rest. This naturally suggested the idea of monarchy; and to this change they were also induced by the contemptible state in which their nation still continued, thinking that the royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> would confer upon it a degree of splendour which otherwise it could not enjoy; and that by having one leader, they would be better able to oppose their enemies. Proceeding, therefore, to elect a king, the choice fell upon Acamapitzin, a man of great estimation among them, and descended from Opophtli, a noble Aztec, and a princess of the royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of Colhuacan. As he was yet a bachelor, they attempted to negotiate a marriage, first with the daughter of the lord of Tacuba, and then of the king of Azcapozalco; but these proposals being rejected with disdain, they applied to Acolmiztli lord of Coatlichan, and a descendant of one of the three Acolhuan princes; who complied with their request, and the nuptials were celebrated with great rejoicings.\n\nIn the mean time, the Tlatelolcos, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> rivals of the Mexicans, resolved not to be behind them in anything which had the least appearance of augmenting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of their state. They likewise, therefore, chose a king; but not thinking proper to choose him from among themselves, they applied to the king of the Tepanecas, who readily sent them his son; and he was crowned first king of Tlatelolco in 1353. In this the Tlatelolcos seem to have had a design of humbling their rivals, as well as rendering themselves more respectable; and therefore it is probable, that they had represented the Mexicans as wanting in that respect due to the Tepanecan monarch, as having elected a king without his leave, though at the same time they were tributaries to him. The consequence of this was, that he took a resolution to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> their tribute. Hitherto they had paid only a certain number of fish and waterfowl; but now they were ordered to bring also several thousands of fir and willow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> to be set in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a> and gardens of Azcapozalco, and to transport to the court a great floating garden, which produced vegetables of every kind known in Anahuac. This being accomplished with great difficulty, the king commanded them next year to bring him another garden, with a duck and swan in it both sitting upon eggs; but lo, that on their arrival at Azcapozalco the brood might be ready to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HATCH\">hatch</a>. This was also done; and the prince had the satisfaction of seeing the young birds come out of the eggs. The third year they were ordered to bring a live stag along with a garden. This was more difficult than any of the former tasks; because they were obliged, in order to hunt the stag, to go to the mountains of the continent, where they were in danger of falling into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of their enemies; however, this also was accomplished, and the desire of the king gratified.\n\nIn this manner the Mexicans were oppressed for no less than 30 years. They freed themselves, however, from all their difficulties by vigorous exertions, absurdly ascribing to the protection of that malevolent being whom they worshipped the glory of every deliverance. Acamapitzin governed this city, which at that time comprehended the whole of his dominions, for 37 years in peace. His queen being barren, he married another wife, but without abandoning the first; and these two, instead of being rivals to one another, lived together in the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a>; the first wife taking upon herself the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of educating Huitzilhuitl, the son of the second. He had, besides, several children by other women, and one named Izcoatl, who afterwards proved one of the best and most renowned kings who sat on the throne of Mexico. He is said also to have conquered four considerable cities; but Clavigero thinks he must in this only have been an auxiliary, it being very improbable, that while he could scarce maintain his own territories, he should think of foreign conquests.\n\nAcamapitzin died in 1389, greatly lamented by the Mexicans, and his death was followed by an interregnum of four months. As the deceased monarch had formally resigned his authority into the hands of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a>, it was necessary that a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> should take place; and when this was done, the choice fell upon Huitzilhuitl, the son of Acama-Huitzilhuitl. As he was still unmarried, it was resolved, if possible, to procure him an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> and advantageous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MATCH\">match</a>. With this view, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPUTATION\">deputation</a> of nobility was sent to the king of Azcapozalco, requesting, in very humble terms, an alliance with one of his daughters. The expressions made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of by these ambassadors are said by our author to have been particularly elegant in the Mexican language; but it is difficult to understand how a speech made among a people ignorant of the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> could be particularly recorded at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HUNDREDS\">hundreds</a> of years after. They are as follow: \"We beseech you, with the most profound respect, to take compassion on our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> and your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> Huitzilhuitl, confined among the thick rushes of the lake.\u2014He is without a wife, and we without a queen.\u2014Vouchsafe, Sir, to part with one of your jewels or most precious feathers. Give us one of your daughters, who may come to reign over us in a country which belongs to you.\"\nThis piece of oratory had such an effect upon the king, that he granted their request, and a Tepanecan princess was conducted in great triumph to Mexico, where the marriage was solemnized with the utmost the king of joy. Though this princess brought him a son for the first year of their marriage, the king, in order to strengthen himself by fresh alliances, married also the daughter of another prince, by whom he had Montezuma Ilhuicamina, the most celebrated of all the Mexican kings.\n\nAs the Mexicans advanced in wealth and power, so did their rivals the inhabitants of Tlatelolco. Their first king died in 1399, leaving his subjects greatly improved in civilization, and the city much enlarged and beautified. The rivalry which subsisted between the two cities had indeed greatly contributed to the aggrandizement of both. The Mexicans had formed too many alliances by marriage with the neighboring nations, had so much improved their agriculture and floating gardens on the lake, and had built so many more vessels to supply their extended commerce and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a>, that they were enabled to celebrate their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SECULAR\">secular</a> year, answering to A.D. 1407, with greater magnificence than they had ever done since they left their original country of Atzlan.\n\nAll this time Teochitlala, the son of Quinatzin, continued to reign in Acollhuaucan, and for 50 years enjoyed uninterrupted tranquility; but being now very far advanced in years, and finding his end approach, he called to him his son Ixtlilxochitl, and recommended to him to beware of the ambitious disposition of the king of Azcapozalco, as he was apprehensive that he might attempt something against the peace of the empire. His suspicions were verified; for on the death of Teochitlala, which happened in 1406, the king of Azcapozalco, without making the usual submissions to the new king, to whom he was a feudatory, set out for his own territories, with a view to stir up the other feudatory princes to rebellion. Having called to him the kings of Mexico and Tlatelolco, he told them that Teochitlala, who had long tyrannized over that country, being dead, he designed to procure freedom to the princes, so that each might rule his own territory entirely independent of the king of Acollhuaucan; but for this purpose he needed their alliance, and trusted to their well-known spirit to take part with him in the enterprise. He informed them likewise, that in order to ensure success, he would find means to unite other princes in the confederacy.\n\nThe new king of Acollhuaucan, in the mean time, was employed in settling the affairs of his kingdom, and endeavouring to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> the good will of his subjects. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> against him was soon discovered; but though Ixtlilxochitl was desirous of heading his army in person, he was dissuaded from doing so by his courtiers; so that the conduct of the war was committed to his generals. To weaken the enemy, they ravaged the territories of six revolted states; but notwithstanding this, and the superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> of the royal army, the war was carried on by the rebels with great obstinacy, their armies being constantly recruited by fresh troops in proportion to their losses. At last, after three years of a ruinous war, the king of Azcapozalco, finding that his resources would at last fail him, sued for peace; but with a design of accomplishing by treachery what he had not yet been able to do by force. His adversary, equally reduced with himself, consented to a peace, though he knew very well that the Tepanecan prince intended to observe it no longer than suited his purpose.\n\nIn the year 1409 died Huitzilhuitl king of Mexico-Chimalpopoca, who likewise left the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of electing a successor poca third to the nobility. They made choice of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> king of Chimalpopoca; and from thence it became an established <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> to choose one of the brothers of the deceased king, or, if he had no brothers, to elect one of his grandsons. While the new prince was endeavouring to secure himself on the throne, the treacherous Tezozomoc used all means in his power to strengthen the party he had formed against the king of Acollhuaucan. In this he was attended with such success, that the unfortunate prince found himself reduced to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of wandering among the neighboring mountains, at the head of a small army, accompanied by the lords of Huexotla and Coatlichan, who remained always faithful to him. The Tepanecans disturbed him to such a degree, by intercepting his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>, that he was forced to beg them of his enemies. One of his grandsons was sent to Otompan, a rebel state, to death and request them to supply their king with the provisions he the king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a> in need of, and to exhort them to abandon the Acollhuaucan cause of the rebels, which they had espoused. No can talk could be more dangerous; yet such was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNANIMITY\">magnanimity</a> of the young prince's disposition, that he readily set out on the journey; nor was he deterred by the information he got that there were in the place certain Tepanecans who had come on purpose to publish a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCLAMATION\">proclamation</a> from Tezozomoc. He went boldly to the most public place of the town, and in presence of those who published the proclamation made known his request. This heroism, however, did not meet with the success it deserved. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> were derided from the moment they were made; but the people did not offer any farther insult, until one of the manner fort threw a stone at him, exciting others of the same stamp to put him to death. The Tepanecans, who had hitherto continued silent, perceiving their opportunity, joined in the general cry to kill the prince, and began also to throw stones. The prince attempted first to defend himself, and afterwards to escape by flight; but, both being equally impossible, he fell under a shower of stones. The Tepanecans exulted in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of treachery, and soon after cut off Ixtlilxochitl himself, after having treacherously persuaded him to a conference with two of their captains. This perfidious act was committed in sight of the royal army, who were too weak to revenge it; the royal corpse was saved with difficulty; and Nezahualcoyotl, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a> apparent to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>, was obliged to shelter himself among the bushes from the fury of his enemies.\n\nTezozomoc having now in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> gained his point, proceeded to pour down his troops upon the cities and districts which had remained faithful quired by the late unfortunate monarch. The people made a most desperate defense, and killed vast numbers of their enemies; but at last being themselves reduced by the calamities of war, and in danger of total extermination, they were obliged to quit their habitations and fly to other countries. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a>, then, finding himself\nself superior to all his adversaries, gave Tezcuco in fief to Chimalpopoca king of Mexico, Huexotla to Tlacacolotl of Tlatelolco; placing faithful governors in other places, and appointing Azcapozalco, the capital of his own territory, the royal residence and capital of Acolhuacan.\n\nPrince Nezahualcoyotl was present in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISGUISE\">disguise</a> at this disposal of his dominions, along with several other persons of distinction who were enemies of the tyrant; and so much was he transported with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, that it was with difficulty he could be restrained from killing Tezozomoc on the spot, though this would certainly have been done at the expense of his own life. All the rest of the Acolhuacan empire submitted; and Nezahualcoyotl <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> himself for the present deprived of all hopes of obtaining the crown.\n\nTezozomoc had now attained the summit of his ambition; but instead of conciliating the minds of his new subjects, oppressed them with new taxes; and being conscious of the precarious situation in which he stood, and tormented with remorse on account of his crimes, fell into melancholy, and was constantly haunted with frightful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a>. He was now become so old, that his body no longer retained its natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>. He was therefore obliged to be covered up with cotton in a great cradle, not being able to fit erect in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a>. In this miserable condition, however, he never forgot his tyranny or cruelty. From his cradle he issued oppressive laws relating to the Acolhuacans; and almost with his last breath renewed his commands with regard to Nezahualcoyotl. At last he expired in the year 1422, leaving the crown to his son Tajatzin.\n\nTezozomoc was no sooner dead than Maxtlaton, without paying the least regard to his father's will, began to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> the functions of a sovereign. Though it was the right of Tajatzin to invite to his father's funeral whom he pleased, Maxtlaton took that upon himself. Nezahualcoyotl, though not invited, came among the rest; but though Tezitzintli, brother to Maxtlaton, inflicted upon his being put to death, the latter opposed it, as it could not then be done privately, and he hoped to find another opportunity. No sooner were the funeral ceremonies over, however, than Maxtlaton behaved in such a manner to his brother Tajatzin, that the prince thought proper to retire to Chimalpopoca king of Mexico, to whom he had been particularly recommended by his father, in order to have his advice. This monarch, agreeable to the character of that age and people, advised him to invite his brother to an entertainment, and then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> him. Unluckily for them both, this discourse was overheard by a servant, who in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of a reward informed the tyrant of what he had heard; but instead of this, Maxtlaton, pretending to disbelieve his story, drove the informer from his presence with ignominy. Notwithstanding this pretence, the tyrant had not the least doubt of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of what was told him; and therefore determined to rid himself of his brother without delay. This he soon accomplished in the very same way that had been projected against himself. Tajatzin, along with the kings of Mexico, Tlatelolco, and some other feudatory princes, were invited by Maxtlaton to an entertainment. The king of Mexico prudently excused himself, but the unsuspecting Tajatzin fell into the snare. He came to the place of entertainment, and was instantly put to death. The company were greatly alarmed; but Maxtlaton, having explained to them his reasons for so doing, they not murdered, only excused him, but proclaimed him king; to which it is not to be doubted that their fears greatly contributed.\n\nThough the king of Mexico escaped a sudden death by his absence at this time, it was only to perish in a more slow and ignominious manner. The vengeance of the Maxtlaton first appeared by sending him a woman's king of drefs in return to the present he sent him as a feudatory; which being a reflection upon his courage, was the highest affront that could be offered him. This insult, however, was quickly followed by one of a much higher nature. Having heard that one of the Mexican prince's wives was an extraordinary beauty, he enjoined some Tepanecan ladies, who were accustomed to visit that princess, to invite her to spend some days with them at Azcapozalco. This being complied with, the tyrant easily got an opportunity of ravishing her, and then sent her back to her husband. Chimalpopoca was so much affected by this misfortune, that he resolved to offer himself up a sacrifice to his god. Maxtlaton, however, was resolved that he should not have even this satisfaction. At the very time of the ceremony, therefore, he sent a body of troops; who entering Mexico without resistance, carried off the king alive, to the astonishment of the multitude; and who probably were so much confounded by this unexpected adventure, that they did not think of making any resistance.\n\nChimalpopoca being carried prisoner to Azcapozalco, was confined in a strong wooden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAGE\">cage</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> prison for criminals. Maxtlaton still was not satisfied: he wished to get into his hands Nezahualcoyotl; and with this view sent a message to him, pretending that he was willing to come to an agreement with him respecting the kingdom of Acolhuacan. Though the prince was well assured of the tyrant's treacherous intentions, he went boldly to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>, presented himself before him, and told him that he had heard of the imprisonment of the king of Mexico; he had heard also that he wished to take away his own life; he desired him to do so, and to gratify his malice. Maxtlaton was so struck with this speech, that he assured the prince he had not formed any design against his life, and that he neither had put to death the king of Mexico, nor would do so. He then gave orders for his being properly entertained, and even allowed him to pay a visit to the king of Mexico in prison. The unfortunate Chimalpopoca, after reciting his misfortunes, requested the prince not to return to court, where they would certainly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> upon some project for taking away his life; and having pathetically recommended to him the care of his subjects, made him a present of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> pendant and some other jewels he wore; after which they took a last farewell.\n\nIn the mean time, the Mexicans raised to the throne Itzcoatl, the son of Acamapitzin by a slave, and who was accounted the most prudent, just, and brave, of all Mexico, the Mexican nation. His election was no less pleasing who affords to Nezahualcoyotl and his party, than it was offensive to Maxtlaton. An alliance was quickly concluded between...\nbetween the exiled prince and the king of Mexico; and this was soon followed by the commencement of hostilities on the part of the former. His first enterprise was against the city of Tezcuco, which he determined to take by assault, but was prevented by the submission of the inhabitants. He put to death, however, all the officers established by the tyrant; and all the Tepanecs he found there. The very same day another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> city named Acolman was furiously attacked by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DETACHMENT\">detachment</a> of his army; great numbers put to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>, and among the rest the governor, who was brother to Maxtlaton; and the same day also Coatlichan was taken by the Chalcefe.\n\nThe Mexican monarch, hearing of the successes of his ally, sent an embassy to congratulate him upon them. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a> was a son of king Huitzilihuatl, named Montezuma, who for his invincible courage and great qualities was furnamed the man of great heart and the archer of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>. The journey was extremely dangerous; but Montezuma undertook it without any fear, accompanied by another nobleman. They got in safety to the place where the prince was; but had the misfortune to be taken prisoners, and were carried to Chalco; the lord of which city, named Tototzin, was an inveterate enemy to the Mexicans. By him he was immediately put in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> confinement, under the care of one Quateozin, who was inviolably attached to the Mexican <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>. Orders were given to the latter to provide no sustenance for the prisoners but what was preferable by his lord, until the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of death which they were to suffer should be determined. Tototzin then sent his prisoners to them, that they might be sacrificed there if they thought proper. These people, however, rejected the proposal with disdain; on which Tototzin, thinking to regain the favour of Maxtlaton, informed him of the prisoners he had in his possession. But Maxtlaton called him a double minded traitor, and commanded him instantly to set the prisoners at liberty. Before this answer arrived, however, Quateozin had instructed the prisoners how to make their escape, and directed them also not to return by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> lest they should again be intercepted, but to embark at a certain place, and proceed by water to Mexico. They followed his advice exactly; and having got to the place to which they were directed, arrived safely at their city, to the great surprise and joy of the inhabitants.\n\nTototzin, enraged at the loss of his prisoners, put Quateozin to a cruel death, destroying also all his family excepting one son and a daughter; of whom the latter fled to Mexico, where she was highly honoured on her father's account. Maxtlaton, too, notwithstanding his generosity to the prisoners (which Clavigero derives from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> opposition to Tototzin), prepared to wage a formidable war with the Mexicans, who had agreed to unite their troops with those of the prince. The Mexican populace, terrified at engaging so powerful an enemy, demanded that their king should submit and beg for peace. So great was the tumult, that the king himself was obliged to consent; and it required the utmost exertions of Montezuma's eloquence to persuade the people to agree to a commencement of hostilities. This being done at last, the king next called together the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> nobility, and asked which of them would have the courage to carry an embassy to the king of the Tepanecs? This adventure appeared so hazardous, that all of them kept a deep silence, until Montezuma declared himself willing to undertake the arduous enterprise. He was ordered to propose peace to Maxtlaton, but to accept of no dishonourable conditions; to which he punctually adhered. Maxtlaton refused to give any immediate answer, but promised to give one next day, after he had consulted his nobility. Montezuma, dreading some treachery if he stood all night, promised to return next day; which he did, and was told that Maxtlaton had determined upon war. Montezuma then performed the ceremony of challenging him, by presenting him with certain defensive weapons, anointing his head, and fixing feathers upon it, as was customary to do with dead persons. Lastly, He protested, in the name of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, that as Maxtlaton would not accept of the offered peace, he and all the Tepanecs would infallibly be ruined. Maxtlaton showed not the least sign of displeasure, but gave Montezuma arms in like manner to present to the king of Mexico; and directed him, for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> security, to return in disguise through a small outlet from the palace. Montezuma followed his advice; but as soon as he found himself out of danger, began to insult the Tepanean guards; and though they rushed violently upon him, he not only escaped from their attacks, but killed one or two of them.\n\nOn his return to Mexico, the populace were again thrown into the utmost consternation by the news that war was inevitable, as the chiefs of the two nations had challenged one another. They now requested the king to allow them to retire from their city, of which they supposed the ruin to be certain. The king encouraged them with the hopes of victory. \"But if we are conquered (replied they), what will become of us?\" \"If that happens (answered the king), we are that moment bound to deliver ourselves into your hands, to be made sacrifices at your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>.\" \"Be it so (replied they), if we are conquered; but if we obtain the victory, we and our descendants are bound to be tributary to you; to cultivate your lands and those of your nobles; to build your houses; and to carry for you, when you go to war, your arms and baggage.\"\n\nMatters being thus settled, intelligence was sent to Prince Nezahualcoyotl to repair with his army to Mexico, which he did without delay; and the day after his arrival a furious engagement took place. The Tepanecan army was commanded by a general named Mazon; Maxtlaton himself not judging it proper to quit his capital. The soldiers on both sides fought with the utmost bravery; but towards night the Mexicans, disheartened by seeing the army of their enemies continually increasing in number, began once more to lose their courage and talk of surrendering. The king, greatly concerned, asked Montezuma what should be done to dissipate the fears of the people? That brave prince replied, that they must fight till death; that if they died with their arms in their hands, it would be honourable; but to survive their defeat, would be eternal ignominy. Nothing could be more salutary than this advice at so critical a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNCTURE\">juncture</a>: for the Mexicans were already begun to implore the mercy of their enemies, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> to sacrifice their chiefs, whose ambition had brought the whole nation into\nMexico into such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DILEMMA\">dilemma</a>. On hearing this, the whole body of nobility, with the king and Montezuma at their head, assaulted the enemy so furiously, that they repelled them from a ditch of which they had taken possession; after which, Montezuma, happening to encounter Mazatl the Tepanecan general, struck him such a blow on the head that he fell down lifeless. Thus the Mexicans were inspired with fresh courage, and their enemies proportionally dispirited: however, they retired for that night to the city, in some hopes of being able to retrieve their fortune next day. Maxtlaton encouraged them by every method in his power; but fortune proved still more unfavourable than the day before. The Tepanecans were now entirely defeated, and the city of Azcapotzalco taken. Maxtlaton, who seems not to have had the courage to fight, had not now the presence of mind to fly. He attempted indeed to hide himself; but being quickly discovered, he was beaten to death with sticks and stones. The city was plundered, the inhabitants butchered, and the houses destroyed by the victors.\n\nThis victory proved decisive in favour of the confederates. Every other place of strength in the country was quickly reduced, until the Tepanecans, finding themselves on the verge of destruction, sent an humble embassy to the king of Mexico, requesting to be taken under his protection, and to become tributaries to him. Itzcoatl received them graciously; but threatened them with total extirpation if they violated the fidelity they had sworn to him.\n\nItzcoatl, after this extraordinary success, took care to have the above-mentioned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> ratified between the nobility and common people, by which the latter were bound to perpetual services. Those who had discouraged the soldiers in time of battle were banished for ever from the state of Mexico; while Montezuma and others who had distinguished themselves by their bravery, were rewarded with lands, as was usual with other conquerors.\n\nNezahualcoyotl made king of Acolhuacan.\n\nItzcoatl, now finding himself firmly seated on the throne of Mexico, set about performing his engagements to the Acolhuacan prince, by seating him on the throne of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>. Having again joined their armies, they marched against Huaxotla, a city which refused to submit even though terms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a> were offered them. Instead of this, they rashly ventured a battle, in which they were entirely defeated; and were then fain to send a deputation of their old men, pregnant women, &c., as was customary in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of distress, to move the enemy to compassion. At last all obstructions being removed, Nezahualcoyotl was seated on the throne of Acolhuacan, the auxiliary troops were dismissed, and Itzcoatl left at liberty to pursue his conquests, in which he was still assisted by the king of Acolhuacan. The first expedition was against Cojohuacan, and other two Tepanecan cities, who had not only refused submission themselves, but excited others to shake off the yoke also. The war against them proved bloody. Three battles were fought, in which Itzcoatl gained no other advantage than making the enemy retreat a little; but in the fourth, while the two armies were hotly engaged, Montezuma, with a body of chosen troops, which he had placed in ambush, attacked the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REAR_GUARD\">rear-<a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> of the rebels with such vigour, that they were soon disordered, and obliged to fly to the city. The conquerors pursued them thither; and Montezuma perceiving that they intended to fortify themselves in the greater temple, frustrated their design by getting possession of it and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> the turret. By this disaster they were so much terrified, that they fled to the mountains south of Cojohuacan; but even there the royal army overtook and pursued them more than 30 miles, till they came to another mountain, where, quite exhausted with fatigue, and seeing no means of escape, they were obliged to surrender at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a>.\n\nHaving thus happily accomplished the conquest of Cojohuacan and the other rebellious cities, the two kings returned to Mexico. Itzcoatl gave great part of the Tepanecan country, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of king of Tacuba, to Totogihuatzin, a grandson of Tezozomoc, but who does not appear to have been any way concerned in his projects against the Mexicans. An alliance was then formed among the three kings on the following terms: The king of Tacuba held his crown between on condition of serving the king of Mexico with all the kings his troops, at any time when required; for which he was to have a fifth part of the spoils taken from the enemy. The king of Acolhuacan was likewise to assist the king of Mexico in war; and for this he was to have a third part of the plunder, after deducting the share of the king of Tacuba; and the remainder was to belong to the king of Mexico. The kings of Tacuba and Acolhuacan were both declared honorary electors of the kings of Mexico; the real electors being four nobles: and the king of Mexico was likewise bound to assist in the wars of his allies whenever it was demanded.\n\nAfter having thus settled matters among themselves, and rewarded their soldiers, Itzcoatl set out with Nezahualcoyotl for Tezcuco, where the Acolhuacan king was crowned with all possible ceremony. Here the new king took every method which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> could suggest to establish his authority on a permanent basis; but while he was thus employed, the Xochimilcas, fearing lest the Mexicans might conquer their country as they had done that of the Tepanecans, held a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> on what was to be done to prevent such a disgrace. In this council it was determined to commence hostilities against that rising state, before it should become more formidable by new conquests. Itzcoatl was no sooner informed of this determination, than he sent Montezuma with a great army against them. The Xochimilcas met him with one still more numerous; but being worse disciplined, they were quickly defeated, and their city taken in a very short time after. This conquest was followed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of Cuilabuc\u00e9, situated on a small island in the lake of Chalco. Their insular situation gave them confidence to attack the formidable power of the Mexicans. The king was so sensible of the difficulty of this enterprise, that he proposed to attack them with the whole force of the alliance: Montezuma, however, with only a small number of men of his own training, whom he furnished with proper vessels, reduced them in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> days.\n\nItzcoatl died in the year 1436, at a very advanced age, in the height of prosperity, and was succeeded as king by Montezuma I., the greatest monarch that ever sat on the Mexican throne. Before his coronation, in order to comply with the barbarous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RITES\">rites</a> of his religion,\nMexico, he made war upon the Chalcefe, in order to procure the prisoners who were to be sacrificed at his coronation; and scarce was this ceremony over, when a new war commenced, which terminated in the destruction of that city. This quarrel happened between the Chalcefe and the Tezcucans. Two of the royal princes of Tezcuco having gone a-hunting on the mountains which overlook the plains of Chalco, while employed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHASE\">chase</a>, and separated from their retinue, with only three Mexican lords, fell in with a troop of Chalcefe soldiers; who, to gratify the cruelty of their master, carried them all prisoners to Chalco. The cruel and inconsiderate tyrant who commanded there instantly put them all to death; after which he caused their bodies to be salted, dried, and placed in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALL\">hall</a> of his palace, where they served as torches to the pine torches burned there for lights every evening. The king of Tezcuco, overwhelmed with grief, and to the last degree exasperated at such an inhuman act, called for the alliance of the allied kings. The city was attacked at once by land and water. The inhabitants, knowing that they had no mercy to expect, fought like men in despair. Even the old tyrant who commanded them, though unable to walk, caused himself to be carried in a litter among the combatants; notwithstanding which they were totally defeated, and the most severe vengeance executed upon them.\n\nMontezuma, on his return, found himself obliged to encounter an enemy more formidable on account of his vicinity, than more powerful ones at a distance. This was the king of Tlatelolco, who had formerly conspired against the life of Itzcoatl; and finding himself disappointed in this, had tried to reduce his power by entering into a confederacy with some of the neighbouring lords. At that time his designs proved abortive, but he resumed them in the time of Montezuma; the consequence of which was, that he was defeated and killed. One Moquihuix was chosen in his room; in whose election it is probable that Montezuma had a considerable share. This was followed by conquests of a much more important nature. The province of Cuilixcas, lying to the southward, was added to his dominions, comprehending a tract of country more than 150 miles in breadth; then, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> to the westward, he conquered another named Tzompalhuacan. This success, however, was for a short time interrupted by a war with Atonaltzin, lord of a territory in the country of the Mixtecas. This prince, puffed up on account of the great wealth he possessed, took it into his head that he would allow no Mexican to travel through his country. Montezuma sent ambassadors to know the reason of such strange conduct; but Atonaltzin gave them no other answer than throwing them some part of his wealth, making a present to the king, and desiring him from thence to observe how much the subjects of Atonaltzin loved him; and that he willingly accepted of war, which was to determine whether he should pay tribute to the Mexicans or the Mexicans to him. Montezuma having informed his allies of this insolent answer, sent a considerable army against Atonaltzin, but had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTIFICATION\">mortification</a> to be informed of its defeat; in consequence of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> of Atonaltzin was increased to a great degree. Montezuma, greatly chagrined at this first check, determined to head his next army in person; but before he could call together another, Atonaltzin had drawn into a confederacy with him the Huexotzingos and Tlalcalans, who were glad of the opportunity, as they supposed, of reducing the power of the Mexicans. Their numbers, however, availed but little; Montezuma in the very first engagement totally defeated the confederate army. The allies of Atonaltzin were particularly unfortunate; for such of them as were not killed in the field of battle, were destroyed by their own party out of revenge for the unfortunate event of the battle.\n\nBy this victory the Mexican monarch became master not only of the dominions of Atonaltzin, but of many other neighbouring princes, against whom he made war on account of their having put to death some Mexican <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> or couriers without any just cause. The conquest of Cuetlachitlan or Coctla, however, which he attempted in 1457, proved a much more difficult task. This province lies on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of the Mexican gulf, and had been formerly inhabited by the Olmecans, whom the Tlalcalans had driven out. The inhabitants were very numerous; but dreading the power of Montezuma, called in those of Tlalcal, together with the Huexotzingos, to their assistance. Along with these allies drew the Cholulans, also into the confederacy; so that this seems to have been the most formidable combination that had yet been formed against the Mexican power. Montezuma collected an excellently equipped army; which, however, he did not on this occasion command in person. It contained a great number of persons of very high rank, among whom were three princes of royal blood, and Moquihuix king of Tlatelolco already mentioned. The combination of the three republics against Mexico was not known at court when the army set out; but Montezuma, being informed of it soon after, sent an order to his generals to return. This accorded so ill with the romantic notions of valour entertained by the Mexicans, that a consultation of the generals was held whether they should obey it or not. At last it was determined that the king's order should be obeyed; but no sooner was this agreed to than Moquihuix accused them all of cowardice, and threatened, with his own troops, unfitted, to go and conquer the enemy. His speech had such an effect upon them all, that they went to meet the confederates. The Cotatltecs fought with great valour, but were unable to resist the royal forces; and their allies were almost totally destroyed. Six thousand two hundred of them were taken prisoners, and soon after sacrificed to the Mexican god of war in the barbarous manner already described. The victory was said to have been owing principally to the valour and good conduct of Moquihuix, inasmuch that to this day a long made in his praise on that occasion is known in Mexico. Montezuma was so well pleased with the victory, that he not only forgave the disobedience of his orders, but bestowed upon Moquihuix a princess, one of his own cousins, to wife.\n\nDuring the reign of this great monarch a violent inundation happened in Mexico. The lake, swelled and swollen by the excessive rains which fell in the year 1446, poured its waters into the city with so much violence that many\nMexico.\n\nmany houses were destroyed, and the streets inundated to such a degree that boats were everywhere made use of. The inundation was soon followed by a famine. This was occasioned by the stinting of the crop of maize in 1448; the ears while young and tender being destroyed by frosts. In 1450 the crop was totally lost for want of water; and in 1451, besides the unfavourable seasons, there was a scarcity of feed. Hence, in 1452, the necessities of the people became so great, that they were obliged to sell themselves for slaves in order to procure subsistence. Montezuma permitted them to go to other countries for support; but being informed that many sold themselves for a few days provision, he ordered, by proclamation, that no woman should sell herself for less than 400 ears of wheat, nor any man for less than 500. He opened also the public granaries for the relief of the lower classes; but nothing was able to stop the progress of the famine.\n\nMontezuma was succeeded by Axayacatl, who like his predecessor instantly commenced a war, for no other reason than that he might have prisoners to sacrifice at his coronation. He pursued Montezuma's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of conquest; in which, however, he was less successful, many of the provinces reduced by that monarch having revolted after his death, so that it was necessary to reconquer them. On his returning successful from one of these expeditions, he built a new temple, to which he gave the name of Coateotl; but the Tlatelolcos, whose ancient rivalry seems to have revived on the death of Montezuma, built another in opposition, which they called Coaxotl. Thus the former hatred between the two nations was renewed, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCORD\">discord</a> took place which ended in the ruin of the Tlatelolcos.\n\nThe Mexicans sustained an irreparable loss in 1469 and 1470 by the death of their allies the kings of Tacuba and Acolhuacan.\n\nThe king of Tacuba was succeeded by his son Chimalpopoca, and the Acolhuacan monarch by his son Nezahualpilli. A short time after the accession of the latter, the war broke out between the Tlatelolcos and Mexicans, which ended in the destruction of the former. King Moquihuix had been married by Montezuma to a sister of Axayacatl, now on the throne of Mexico; but it appears that this princess never was greatly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of his affection. On the contrary, he took all methods of expressing his dislike, either out of enmity to herself, or envy of the superior greatness of her brother. Not content with this, he entered into an alliance with a great number of the neighbouring states, in order to reduce the Mexican greatness. His wife, however, being informed of this scheme, communicated the particulars to her brother; and soon after, being impatient of the ill usage she received, came to Mexico with her four sons to claim the protection of her brother. This uncommon accident exasperated the Mexicans and Tlatelolcos against each other to such a degree, that wherever they met, they fought, abused, and murdered each other. The king of Tlatelolco prepared for war with many horrible ceremonies, of which the drinking of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> blood was one. A day was appointed for attacking Mexico. Xiloman, lord of Colhuacan, was to begin the attack, afterwards to pretend flight, in order to induce the Mexicans to follow him; after which the Tlatelolcos were to fall upon their rear.\n\nFor some reason, however, with which we are not acquainted, the Tlatelolcos began the attack without waiting for Xiloman; the consequence of which was, that he retired in disgust, leaving them to finish their battle the best way they could. The engagement lasted till night, when the Tlatelolcos were obliged to retire. Axayacatl, during the night, disposed of his troops in all the roads which led to Tlatelolco, appointing them to meet in the market-place. The Tlatelolcos, finding themselves attacked on all sides, retired gradually before the Mexicans, until at last they were forced into the market-place, where they found themselves worse than ever on account of its narrowness, which did not allow them room to act. The king stood on the top of the great temple, encouraging his men to exert themselves against the enemy. His words, however, had now lost their usual influence. He not only was not obeyed, but was reproached with cowardice because he did not come down and fight among the rest. At last the Mexicans arrived at the temple, and ascended to the balcony where the king was. He made a desperate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> for a little; but by a violent push in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> was thrown backwards upon the steps of the temple, and flung or perhaps killed by the fall.\n\nThe Tlatelolcos being thus reduced, Axayacatl next set out on an expedition against the Matlazincas, a tribe in the vale of Toluca, who still refused to submit to the Mexican yoke. Having proved successful in this expedition, he undertook to subdue also the northern part of the valley, now called Valle de Ixtlahuacan, particularly Xiquipiloa, a considerable city and state of the Otomies, whose chief was much renowned for strength and bravery. Axayacatl, who likewise valued himself on these qualities, encountered him in single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a>. In this, however, he was overmatched, and received a violent wound in the thigh; after which he would have been taken prisoner, had not some young Mexicans made a desperate effort for his rescue. Notwithstanding this disaster, Axayacatl's army gained a complete victory, carrying off 11,000 prisoners, among whom was the chief of the Otomies himself, and two of his officers who had attacked the king. These chiefs were put to death at an entertainment of the allied kings, the sight of their agonies not interrupting in the least the mirth of the feast; so much were they familiarized to the shedding of human blood.\n\nHe was succeeded by his elder brother Tizoc, succeeded. He intended to have built a larger temple than any that had yet been seen in Mexico, though that originally built had been greatly enlarged by some of his predecessors. For this purpose he collected a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of materials; but before he could bring his projects to bear, he was taken off by a conspiracy of his subjects. During the reign of Tizoc, the Acolhuacans made war upon the Huezotzinca, ruined their city, and conquered their territory. Nezahualpilli also, the Acolhuacan monarch, though he had already several wives, had not made any of them queen, having wished to confer that honour upon one of the royal family of Mexico. Tizoc readily gave him one of his granddaughters, who had a sister of singular beauty named Xocoloxin. The friendship betwixt these two ladies was such, that the one could\nnot think of being separated from the other; for which reason the new queen sought and obtained permission to take her sister along with her to Tezcoco. Xocotzin had not been long there before the king fell in love with her, and married her with the title of queen likewise. Soon after this second marriage, the first queen brought forth a son named Cacamatzin, who succeeded him in the throne, and was afterwards taken prisoner by the Spaniards.\n\nAhuitztl, the brother of Tizoc, succeeded him in the kingdom of Mexico. His first object was to finish the great temple begun by his predecessor; and such was the number of workmen, that it was completed in four years. During the time that it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, the king employed himself in making war with different nations, referring all the prisoners he took for victims at the dedication of the temple. The number of prisoners sacrificed at this dedication is said by Torquemada to have been 72,324; by other historians 64,060. The miserable victims were ranged in two files, each a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> and an half in length, terminating at the temple. The same year another temple was built by a feudatory lord, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of the great one built by the king; at the dedication of which a vast number of prisoners were also sacrificed. These <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a> were dedicated in 1486. In 1487 happened a violent earthquake; and Chimalpopoca king of Acolhuacan died, who was succeeded by Totoquihuatzin II.\n\nAhuitzotl died in 1502, of a disorder produced by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTUSION\">contusion</a> in his head. At the time of his death, the Mexican empire was brought to its utmost extent. His successor, Montezuma Xocoyotzin or Montezuma Junior, was a person of great bravery, besides which he was likewise a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a>, and held in great estimation on account of his gravity and the dignity of his deportment. His election was unanimous; and the nobles congratulated themselves on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> the country was to enjoy under him, little thinking how short the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of their happiness or of their empire was to be.\n\nThe first care of the new monarch, as usual, was to procure victims for the barbarous sacrifices to be made at his coronation. The people of Atlisco, who had again shaken off the Mexican yoke, were the sufferers on this occasion, being once more reduced, though not without great loss on the part of the Mexicans, some of whose bravest officers perished in the war. The ceremony of coronation was performed with such pomp as had never been seen before in Mexico; but no sooner was this ceremony over than Montezuma began to discover a pride which nobody had suspected before. All his predecessors had been accustomed to confer offices upon persons of merit, and those who appeared the most able to discharge them, without any partiality as to birth or wealth. Montezuma, however, disapproved of the conduct of his predecessors, under pretence that the plebeians should be employed according to their rank; for that in all their actions the baseness of their birth and the meanness of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> appeared; and in consequence of this maxim he deprived all the commoners of the offices they held about the court, declaring them incapable of holding any for the future. All the royal servants now were people of rank. Besides those who lived in the palace, 600 feudatory lords and nobles came to pay court to him. They passed the whole day in the antichamber, where none of their servants were permitted to enter; conversing in a low voice, and waiting the orders of their sovereign. The servants of these lords were so numerous that they occupied three small courts of the palace, and many waited in the streets.\n\nIn every respect Montezuma kept up, as far as was possible, an extravagant appearance of dignity. His clothes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KITCHEN\">kitchen</a> utensils were of the finest earthen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WARE\">ware</a>, and played in his tablecloths and napkins of the finest cotton; but none of these ever served the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> more than once, being immediately made a present of to some nobleman. The vessels in which his chocolate and other drinks from cocoa were prepared, were all of gold, or some beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>-shell, or naturally-formed vessels, curiously varnished. He had also gold plate, but it was used only on particular occasions in the temple. The number and variety of his dishes astonished the Spaniards. He took great delight in the cleanliness of his own person, and of everything about him. He bathed regularly every day, and had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATHS\">baths</a> in all his palaces. Every day he wore four dresses, never using again those which he had put off, but reserving them as largesse for the nobility, or those who had distinguished themselves in war. The expense of all this rendered him very disagreeable to a great number of his subjects; though others were pleased with the readiness he showed to relieve the necessities of individuals, and his generosity in rewarding his generals and ministers who deserved it. Among other actions worthy of imitation, he appointed the city of Colhuacan as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a> for all invalids, who after having faithfully served the crown either in the civil or military line, required a provision on account of their age and infirmities. In this place they were maintained and attended at the expense of the king.\n\nThe reign of Montezuma, even before the arrival of the Spaniards, was far from being so glorious with regard to his successes in war as those of his predecessors had been. He reduced indeed one rebellious province, and conquered another which had never before been subjugated; but in his war with Tlacalca he was with Tlacalca by no means successful. This was but a small republic at no great distance from the capital, but the inhabitants were remarkable for their bravery and independent spirit. The neighbouring states, however, who had been reduced by the Mexicans, envious of their liberty and prosperity, exasperated the Mexicans against them, by representing that the Tlacalcanes were delirious of making themselves masters of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> provinces on the Mexican gulf, and that by their commerce with these provinces they were increasing their wealth and power, and gaining the hearts of the people with whom they were to traffic. In consequence of this representation, strong garrisons were placed on the frontiers of Tlacalca, to obstruct the commerce of the inhabitants, and thus to deprive them of the means of obtaining some of the necessaries of life. The Tlacalcanes complained; but received no other answer than that the king of Mexico was lord of all the world, and that the Tlacalcanes must submit and pay tribute to him. The Tlacalcanes returned a spirited answer to this insolent speech, and began to fortify their frontier. They had already enclosed all the lands of the republic.\nblic with intrenchments; and to these they now added a wall of six miles in length on the west side, where an invasion was most to be apprehended; and so well did they defend themselves, that though they were frequently attacked by the neighbouring states in alliance with Mexico, or subject to it, not one of them was able to wrest a foot of ground from them. Thus a continual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of wars and engagements took place between the states of Mexico and this republic, which continued till the arrival of the Spaniards.\n\nDuring the remainder of Montezuma's reign the empire was disturbed by various rebellions, of which the accounts are not sufficiently interesting to merit a particular detail; but in the year 1580, Montezuma began to entertain apprehensions of that fatal event which at length overtook him. An expedition having been undertaken against a very distant region named Amatla, the army in marching over a lofty mountain were attacked by a furious north <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, accompanied with snow; which made great havoc in the army, many of them perishing with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, and others being killed by the trees rooted up by the wind. The remains of the army continued their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">march</a> to Amatla, where they were almost all killed in battle. By this and other calamities, together with the appearance of a comet, the Mexicans were thrown into the utmost consternation. Montezuma was so terrified by these omens, that having in vain consulted his astrologers, he applied to the king of Acolhuacan, who was reported to be very skilful in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINATION\">divination</a>. Nezahualpilli having conferred with him upon the subject, told Montezuma that the comet presaged some calamity which was about to befall their kingdoms by the arrival of a new people; but this being unsatisfactory to the emperor, the king of Acolhuacan challenged him to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAME\">game</a> at foot-ball, staking the truth of his prediction on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> of the game. Montezuma lost the game, but did not yet acquiesce in the truth of his prediction. He therefore applied to a celebrated astrologer, whom it seems he had not yet consulted; but he confirmed the interpretation of Nezahualpilli: for which the emperor caused his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> to be pulled down, and himself buried in the ruins.\n\nConquest of Mexico itself was first discovered, though imperfectly, by a Spaniard named Nunez de Balboa; but in 1518 the conquest of it was undertaken by a celebrated adventurer named Ferdinando Cortes. On the 13th of February 1519, he set sail from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAVANNAH\">Havannah</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUBA\">Cuba</a>; and soon landed on the island of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COZUMEL\">Cozumel</a>, on the coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-YUCATAN\">Yucatan</a>, discovered the preceding year. Here he joined one of his officers named Pedro d'Alvarado, who had arrived some days before, and collected some booty and taken a few prisoners. But the general severely censured his conduct; and the prisoners were dismissed, after they had been informed by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> interpreter named Melchior, that such injuries were entirely disagreeable to the intentions and wishes of Cortes. Here he mustered his army, and found that it amounted to 508 soldiers, 16 horsemen, and 109 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>, pilots, and mariners. Having encouraged his men by a proper speech, and released, by means of some Indian ambassadors, a Spaniard named Jeronimo de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGUILAR\">Aguilar</a>, who had been detained a prisoner for eight years, he proceeded to the river Tabasco, where he hoped to be received in a friendly manner, as one Grijalva had been a short time before; but, from some unknown cause, he was violently attacked by them; however, the superiority of the Spanish arms soon decided the victory, and the inhabitants were obliged to own the king of Castile as their sovereign.\n\nThe Spaniards then continued their course westward, to the harbour of St Juan de Ulua; where they were met by two Mexican canoes, which carried two ambassadors from the emperor of that country, and showed the greatest signs of peace and amity. Their language was unknown to Aguilar; but one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> prisoners above mentioned understood it, and translated it into the Yucatan tongue; after which Aguilar interpreted the meaning in Spanish. This slave was afterwards named Donna Marina, and proved very useful in their conferences with the natives.\n\nAt this time the Mexican empire, according to Dr Robertson, was arrived at a pitch of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a> which no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> had ever attained in so short a period. Though it had subsisted only for 130 years, its dominion extended from the north to the south sea, over territories stretching about 500 leagues from east to west, and more than 200 from north to south; comprehending provinces not inferior in fertility, population, and opulence, to any in the torrid zone. Though by nature Montezuma possessed a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of courage and resolution; yet from the first moment that the Spaniards appeared on his coast, he displayed symptoms of timidity and embarrassment, and all his subjects were embarrassed as well as himself. The general dismay which took place on this occasion was partly owing to the strange <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> the Spaniards made, and the prodigious power of their arms; but partly also to the following circumstance. An opinion prevailed almost universally among the Americans, that some dreadful calamity impended over their heads, from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of formidable invaders who should come from regions towards the rising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, to overrun and defoliate their country.\n\nBy means of his two interpreters, Donna Marina and Aguilar, Cortes learned that the chiefs of the Mexican embassy were deputies from Piltzaco and Teutle; the one governor of a province under the emperor, and the other the commander of all his forces in that province: the purport of their embassy was to inquire what his intentions were in visiting their coasts, and to offer him what assistance he might need in order to continue his voyage. Cortes, in his turn, also professed the greatest friendship; and informed the ambassadors, that he came to propose matters of the utmost consequence to the welfare of the prince and his kingdom; which he would more fully unfold in person to the governor and the general. Next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, without waiting for any answer, he landed his troops, his horses, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>; began to erect huts for his men, and to fortify his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a>.\n\nThe next day the ambassadors had a formal audience; at which Cortes acquainted them, that he came from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DON\">Don</a> Carlos of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-AUSTRIA\">Austria</a>, king of Castile, the greatest monarch of the east, and was intrusted with propositions of such moment, that he would impart them to none but the emperor himself, and therefore required to be conducted immediately to the capital. This demand produced the greatest uneasiness;\nand the ambassadors did all in their power to dissuade Cortes from his design, endeavouring to conciliate his good will by the presents sent him by Montezuma. These they introduced with great parade, and consisted of fine cotton cloth, of plumes of various colours, and of ornaments of gold and silver to a considerable value, the workmanship of which appeared to be as curious as the materials were rich. But these presents served only to excite the avidity of the Spaniards, and to increase their desire for becoming masters of a country which abounded with so many precious commodities. Cortes indeed could scarcely restrain himself so far as to hear the arguments made use of by the ambassadors to dissuade him from going to the capital; and, in a haughty, determined tone, insisted on his former demand of being admitted to a personal interview with their sovereign.\n\nDuring this conversation, some painters in the retinue of the Mexican chiefs had been diligently employed in delineating, upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> cotton cloths, figures of the ships, horses, artillery, soldiers, and whatever else attracted their eyes as singular.\n\nWhile exerting their utmost efforts in representing all these wonderful things, messengers were immediately dispatched to Montezuma with the pictures, and a full account of everything that had passed since the arrival of the Spaniards, together with some European curiosities to Montezuma; which Cortes believed would be acceptable on account of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a>. The Mexican monarchs had couriers posted at proper stations along the principal roads; and as these were trained to agility by a regular education, they conveyed intelligence with surprising rapidity. Though the city in which Montezuma resided was above 180 miles from St Juan de Ulua, Cortes' presents were carried thither, and an answer returned to his demands, in a few days. As the answer was unfavourable, Montezuma had endeavoured to mollify the Spanish general by the richness of his presents. These consisted of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> of the country; cotton stuffs so fine, and of such delicate texture, as to resemble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>; pictures of animals, trees, and other natural objects, formed with feathers of different colours, disposed and mingled with such skill and elegance as to rival the works of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> in truth and beauty of imitation. But what chiefly attracted their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, were two large plates of a circular form; one of malleable gold representing the sun, the other of silver representing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>. These were accompanied with bracelets, collars, rings, and other trinkets of gold; and that nothing might be wanting which could give the Spaniards a complete idea of what the country afforded, some boxes filled with pearls, precious stones, and grains of gold unwrought, as they had been found in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> or rivers, were sent along with the rest. Cortes received all with an appearance of the most profound respect for Montezuma; but when the Mexicans, presuming upon this, informed him, that their matter, though he desired him to accept of what he had sent as a token of his regard for the prince whom he represented, would not give his consent that foreign troops should approach nearer to his capital, or even allow them to continue longer in his dominions, Cortes declared, in a manner more resolute and peremptory than formerly, that he must insist on his first demand; as he could not, without dishonour, return to his own sovereign until he was admitted into the presence of the prince whom he was appointed to visit in his name.\n\nThe pusillanimity of the Indian monarch afforded time to the Spaniards to take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> which would have been out of their power had they been vigorously attacked on their first refusal to obey his orders. Cortes used every method of securing the affections of the soldiers; which indeed was very necessary, as many of them began to complain against the rashness of his attempt in leading them against the whole force of the Mexican empire. In a short time Texitle ar Montezuma arrived with another present from Montezuma, and accompanying with it delivered the ultimate orders of that monarch to depart instantly out of his dominions; and to leave his when Cortes, instead of complying with his demands, dominions renewed his request of audience, the Mexican immediately left the camp with strong marks of surprise and resentment. Next morning, none of the natives appeared; all friendly correspondence seemed to be at an end, and hostilities were expected to commence every moment. A sudden consternation ensued among the Spaniards, and a party was formed against him by the adherents of Velasquez; who took advantage of the occasion, and deputed one of their number, a principal officer, to remonstrate, as if in name of the whole army, against his rashness, and to urge the necessity of his returning to Cuba. Cortes received the message without any appearance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMOTION\">emotion</a>; and as he well knew the temper and wishes of his soldiery, with much complacency he pretended to comply with the request now made him, and issued orders that the army should be in readiness next day to embark for Cuba. Upon hearing this, the troops, as Cortes had expected, were quite outrageous; they positively refused to comply with these orders, and threatened immediately to choose another general if Cortes continued to insist on their departure.\n\nOur adventurer was highly pleased with the disposition which now appeared among his troops; nevertheless, dissembling his sentiments, he declared, that his orders for embarking had proceeded from a persuasion that it was agreeable to his fellow-soldiers, to whose opinion he had sacrificed his own; but now he acknowledged his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, and was ready to resume his original plan of operation. This speech was highly applauded; and Cortes, without allowing his men time to cool, set about carrying his designs into execution. In order to give a beginning to a colony, he Villa Rica assembled the principal persons in his army, and by founded their suffrages elected a council and magistrates, in whom the government was to be vested. The persons chosen were most firmly attached to Cortes; and the new settlement had the name of Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz; that is, the rich town of the true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>.\n\nBefore this court of his own making, Cortes did not hesitate at refusing all his authority, and was immediately re-elected chief <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> of the colony, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a>-general of his army, with an ample command in Cortes million, in the king's name, to continue in force till the royal pleasure should be farther known. The soldiers eagerly ratified their choice by loud acclamations; and Cortes, now considering himself as no longer accountable to any subject, began to assume a\nMexico much greater degree of dignity, and to exercise more extensive powers than he had done before.\n\nCortes having thus strengthened himself as well as he could, resolved to advance into the country; and to this he was encouraged by the behaviour of the cacique or petty prince of Zempoalha, a considerable town at no great distance. Here he was received in the most friendly manner imaginable, and had a respect paid towards him almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to adoration. The cacique informed him of many particulars relating to the character of Montezuma.\u2014He told him that he was a tyrant, haughty, cruel, and suspicious; who treated his own subjects with arrogance, ruined the conquered provinces by his extortions, and often tore their sons and daughters from them by violence; the former to be offered as victims to his gods, the latter to be reserved as concubines for himself and favourites. Cortes, in reply, artfully intimated, that one great object of the Spaniards in visiting a country so remote from their own was, to redress grievances, and to relieve the oppressed; and having encouraged him to hope for this interposition in due time, continued his march to Quiahtlan, the territory of another cacique, and where, by the friendly aid of the Indians, a Spanish colony was soon formed.\n\nDuring the residence of Cortes in these parts, he so far wrought on the minds of the caciques of Zempoalha and Quiahtlan, that they ventured to infuse the Mexican power, at the very name of which they had been formerly accustomed to tremble. Some of Montezuma's officers having appeared to levy the usual tribute, and to demand a certain number of human victims, as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPIATION\">expiation</a> of their guilt in presuming to hold intercourse with those strangers whom the emperor had commanded to leave his dominions; instead of obeying his orders, they made them prisoners, treated them with great indignity, and, as their superstition was no less barbarous than Montezuma's, they threatened to sacrifice them to their gods.\n\nThough Cortes had now taken such measures as in a manner ensured his success; yet as he had thrown off all dependence on the governor of Cuba, who was his lawful superior, and apprehended his interest at court, he thought proper, before he set out on his intended expedition, to take the most effectual measures against the impending danger. With this view, he persuaded the magistrates of his colony to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to the king, containing a pompous account of their own services, of the country they had discovered, &c. and of the motives which had induced them to throw off their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a> to the governor of Cuba, and to settle a colony dependent on the crown alone, in which the supreme power, civil as well as military, had been vested in Cortes; humbly requesting their sovereign to ratify what had been done by his royal authority.\n\nSome soldiers and sailors, secretly disaffected to Cortes, formed a design of seizing one of the brigantines, and making their escape to Cuba, in order to give such intelligence to the governor as might enable him to intercept the vessel which was to carry the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a> and despatches to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>. This conspiracy was conducted with profound secrecy; but at the moment when every thing was ready for execution, the secret was discovered by one of the associates. The latent spirit of disaffection which Cortes was now too well convinced had not been extinguished amongst his troops, gave him very great uneasiness. The only method which he could think of to prevent such conspiracies for the future was to destroy his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a>, and thus deprive his soldiers of every resource except that of conquest; and with this proposal he persuaded his men to comply. With <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> consent therefore the ships were drawn ashore, and, after being stripped of their sails, rigging, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> work, and whatever else might be of use, they were broke in pieces.\n\nCortes having thus rendered it necessary for his troops to follow wherever he chose to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, began his march to Zempoalha with 500 infantry, 15 horses, and six field pieces. The rest of his troops being left fit for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, he left them as a garrison in Villa Rica, under the command of Escalante, an officer of merit, and warmly attached to his interest. The cacique of Zempoalha supplied him with provisions; and with 200 of those Indians called Tamales, whose office, in a country where tame animals were unknown, was to carry burdens, and perform all manner of servile labour. He offered likewise a considerable body of troops; but Cortes was satisfied with 400; taking care, however, to choose persons of such note, that they might serve as hostages for the fidelity of their master.\n\nNothing memorable happened till the Spaniards arrived on the confines of the republic of Tlataca. The inhabitants of that province were warlike, fierce, and revengeful, and had made considerable progress in agriculture and some other arts. They were implacable enemies to Montezuma; and therefore Cortes hoped that it would be an easy matter for him to procure their friendship. With this view, four messengers of high rank were sent ambassadors to Tlataca, dressed with all the badges of that office among the Indians. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a> were divided in their opinions with regard to the proposals of Cortes; but at last Magificatzin, one of the oldest senators, and a person of great authority, mentioned the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a> of their ancestors, and the revelations of their priests; that a race of invincible men, of divine origin, who had power over the elements, should come from the east to subdue their country. He compared the resemblance which the strangers bore to the persons figured in the traditions of Mexico, their dominion over the elements of fire, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, and water; he reminded the senate of their prodigies, omens, and signals, which had lately terrified the Mexicans, and indicated some very important event; and then declared his opinion, that it would be rashness to oppose a force apparently assisted by heaven, and men who had already proved, to the sad <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> of those who opposed them, that they were invincible. This orator was opposed by Xicotencal, who endeavoured to prove that the Spaniards were at best but powerful magicians: that they had rendered themselves obnoxious to the gods by pulling down their images and altars, (which indeed Cortes had very imprudently done at Zempoalha); and of consequence, that they might easily be overcome, as the gods would not fail to resent such an outrage. He therefore voted for war, and advised the crushing of these invaders at one blow.\n\nThe advice of Xicotencal prevailed; and in consequence of it, the ambassadors were detained; which\ngiving Cortes the alarm, he drew nearer the city of Tlascalca. They suffered him with his army drawn up in good order, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> a strong wall between two mountains, which might have been very advantageously defended against him. He had not advanced far beyond this pass, however, before a party of Tlascalans with plumes were discovered, which denoted that an army was in the field. These he drove before him by a detachment of six <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, obliged them to join another party, and then reinforcing the advanced detachment, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> the enemy with such vigour that they began to retire. Five thousand Tlascalans then rushed out of their hiding places, just as the infantry came up to assist their slender body of cavalry. The enemy attacked with the utmost fury; but were so much disconcerted by the first discharge of the firearms, that they retreated in confusion, furnishing the Spaniards with an opportunity of pursuing them with great slaughter. Cortes, however, supposing that this could not be their whole force, advanced with the utmost caution, in order of battle, to an eminence, from whence he had a view of the main body of the Tlascalan army commanded by Xicotencatl, consisting of no fewer than 40,000 men. By these the small army of Cortes was entirely surrounded; which Xicotencatl no sooner perceived, than he contracted the circle with incredible diligence, while the Spaniards were almost overwhelmed with showers of arrows, darts, and stones. It is impossible but in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> many of the Spaniards must have perished, had it not been for the insufficiency of the Indian weapons. This circumstance gave the Spaniards a prodigious advantage over them; and therefore the Tlascalans, notwithstanding their valour and superiority in number, could accomplish no more in the present instance, than to kill one horse and lightly wound nine soldiers.\n\nThe Tlascalans being taught by this, and some subsequent encounters, how much they were inferior to the Spaniards, began to conceive them to be really what Magicatzin had said; a superior order of beings, against whom human power could not prevail. In this extremity they had recourse to their priests, requiring them to reveal the causes of such extraordinary events, and to declare what means they should take to repel such formidable invaders. The priests, after many sacrifices and incantations, delivered their response, That these strangers were the offspring of the sun, procreated by his animating energy in the regions of the east: that, by day, while cherished with the influence of his parental beams, they were invincible; but by night, when his reviving heat was withdrawn, their vigour declined and faded like herbs in the field, and they dwindled down into mortal men. In consequence of this, the Tlascalans acted in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> to one of their most established maxims in war, and ventured to attack the enemy in the night time, hoping to destroy them when enfeebled and surprised. But the Spanish centinels having observed some extraordinary movements among the Tlascalans, gave the alarm. Immediately the troops were under arms, and falling out, defeated their antagonists with great slaughter, without allowing them to approach the camp. By this disaster the Tlascalans were heartily disposed to peace; but they were at a loss to form an adequate idea of the enemies they had to deal with. They could not ascertain the nature of these surprising beings, or whether they were really of a benevolent or malignant disposition. There were circumstances in their behaviour which seemed to favour each opinion. On the one hand, as the Spaniards constantly dismissed the prisoners whom they took, not only without injury, but often with presents of European toys, and renewed their offers of peace after every victory; this lenity amazed people accustomed to the exterminating system of war known in America, and who sacrificed and devoured without mercy all the captives taken in battle; and disposed them to entertain sentiments favourable to their humanity. But, on the other hand, as Cortes had seized 50 of their countrymen who brought provisions to their camp, and cut off their heads; this bloody spectacle, added to the terror occasioned by the firearms and horses, filled them with dreadful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of their ferocity. Accordingly they addressed them in the following manner: \"If (said they) you are divinities of a cruel and savage nature, we present to you five slaves, that you may drink their blood and eat their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>. If you are mild deities, accept an offering of incense and variegated plumes. If you are men, here is meat, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>, and fruit, to nourish you.\" Which is After this address, the peace was soon concluded, to granted, the great satisfaction of both parties. The Tlascalans yielded themselves as vassals to the crown of Castile, and engaged to assist Cortes in all his operations; while he took the republic under his protection, and promised to defend their persons and possessions from injury and violence.\n\nCortes left no method untried to gain the favour and confidence of the Tlascalans; which, however, he had almost entirely lost, by his untimely zeal in destroying their idols as he had done those of Zempoala. But he was deterred from this rash <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> by his chaplain Father Bartholomew de Olmedo; and left the Tlascalans in the undisturbed exercise of their superstition, requiring only that they should desist from their horrid practice of offering human victims. As soon as his troops were fit for service, he resolved to continue his march towards Mexico, notwithstanding the remonstrances of the Tlascalans, who looked upon his destruction as unavoidable if he put himself into the power of such a faithless prince as Montezuma. But the emperor, or, probably intimidated with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> of his exploits, had resolved to admit his visit; and informed Cortes that he had given orders for his friendly reception at Cholula, the next place of any consequence on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> to Mexico. Cortes was received with much seeming cordiality; but 6000 Tlascalan troops who accompanied him were of Montezuma obliged to remain without the town, as the Cholulans refused to admit their ancient enemies within their precincts. Yet two of these, by disguising themselves, got into the city, and acquainted Cortes that they observed the women and children belonging to the principal citizens retiring every night in a great hurry, and that six children had been sacrificed in the great temple; a sign that some warlike enterprise was at hand. At the same time Donna Marina, the interpreter, received information from an Indian woman of distinction, whose confidence she had gained, that the destruction of the Spaniards was concerted; that a body of Mexican troops lay concealed near the town; that some of the streets were barricaded, in others deep pits or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENCHES\">trenches</a> were dug,\ndug, and slightly covered over, as traps into which the horse might fall; that stones and missile weapons were collected on the tops of the temples, with which to overwhelm the infantry; that the fatal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> was already at hand, and their ruin unavoidable. Cortes, alarmed at this news, secretly arrested three of the chief priests, from whom he extorted a confession that confirmed the intelligence he had already received. As not a moment was to be lost, he instantly resolved to prevent his enemies, and to inflict on them such dreadful vengeance as might strike Montezuma and his subjects with terror.\n\nOn a signal given, the troops rushed out, and fell upon the multitude, destitute of leaders, and so much astonished, that the weapons dropped from their hands, and they stood motionless, and incapable of defence. While the Spaniards attacked them in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a>, the Tlacalans did the same in the rear; the streets were filled with slaughter; the temples, which afforded a retreat to the priests and some leading men, were set on fire, and they perished in the flames. At length the carnage ceased, after the slaughter of 6000 Cholulans, without the loss of a single Spaniard. Cortes then released the magistrates; and reproaching them bitterly for their intended treachery, declared, that as justice was now appeased, he forgave the offence; but required them to recall the inhabitants who had fled, and re-establish order in the town.\n\nFrom Cholula, Cortes advanced directly towards Mexico; and throughout the whole of his journey was entertained with accounts of the oppressions and cruelty of Montezuma. This gave him the greatest hope of accomplishing his design; as he now perceived that the empire was entirely divided, and no sort of unanimity prevailed among them. No enemy appeared to check his progress. Montezuma was quite irrefutable; and Cortes was almost at the gates of the capital before the emperor had determined whether to receive him as a friend or oppose him as an enemy. But as no sign of open hostility appeared, the Spaniards, without regarding the fluctuations of Montezuma's sentiments, continued their march to Mexico, with great circumspection and the strictest discipline, though without seeming to suspect the prince whom they were about to visit.\n\nWhen they drew near the city, about 1000 persons, who appeared to be of distinction, came forth to meet them, adorned with plumes, and clad in mantles of fine cotton. Each of these, in his order, passed by Cortes, and saluted him according to the mode deemed most respectful and submissive in their country. They announced the approach of Montezuma himself, and soon after his harbingers came in sight. There appeared first 200 persons in an uniform dress, with large plumes of feathers, alike in fashion, marching two and two, in deep silence, barefooted, with their eyes fixed on the ground. These were followed by a company of higher rank, in their most showy apparel: in the midst of whom was Montezuma, in a chair or litter richly ornamented with gold and feathers of various colours. Four of his principal favourites carried him on their shoulders, others supported a canopy of curious workmanship over his head. Before him marched three officers with rods of gold in their hands, which they lifted up on high at certain intervals; and at that signal all the people bowed their heads, and hid their faces, as unworthy to look on so great a monarch.\n\nWhen he drew near, Cortes dismounting, advanced towards him with officious haste, and in a respectful posture. At the same time Montezuma alighted from his chair, and leaning on the arms of two of his near relations, approached with a slow and stately pace, his attendants covering the street with cotton cloths, that he might not touch the ground. Cortes accosted him with profound reverence, after the European fashion. He returned the salutation, according to the mode of his country, by touching the earth with his hand, and then kissing it. This ceremony appeared such amazing condescension in a proud monarch, who scarcely deigned to consider the rest of mankind as of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> with himself, that all his subjects firmly believed those persons, before whom he humbled himself in this manner, to be something more than human. Accordingly, as they marched through the crowd, the Spaniards frequently, and with much satisfaction, heard themselves denominated teules, or divinities. Nothing material palled in this first interview. Montezuma conducted Cortes to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> which he had prepared for his reception; and immediately took leave of him with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITENESS\">politeness</a> not unworthy of a court more refined: \"You are now (says he), with your brothers, in your own house; refresh yourselves after your fatigue, and be happy until I return.\" The place allotted to the Spaniards for their lodging was a house built by the father of Montezuma. It was surrounded by a stone wall, with towers at proper distances, which served for defence as well as for ornament; and its apartments and courts were so large as to accommodate both the Spaniards and their Indian allies. The first care of Cortes was to take precautions for his security, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTING\">planting</a> the artillery so as to command the different avenues which led to it, by appointing a large division of his troops to be always on guard, and by posting sentinels at proper stations, with injunctions to observe the same vigilant discipline as if they were within sight of an enemy's camp.\n\nIn the evening Montezuma returned to visit his guests with the same pomp as in their first interview; and brought presents of such value, not only to Cortes and to his officers, but even to the private men, as proved the liberality of the monarch to be suitable to the opulence of his kingdom. A long conference ensued, in which Cortes learned what was the opinion of Montezuma with respect to the Spaniards. It was an established tradition, he told him, among the Mexicans, that their ancestors came originally from a remote region, and conquered the provinces now subject to his dominion; that after they were settled there, the great captain who conducted this colony returned to his own country, promising, that at some future period his descendants should visit them, assume the government, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFORM\">reform</a> their constitutions and laws; that, from what he had heard and seen of Cortes and his followers, he was convinced that they were the very persons whose appearance their prophecies taught them to expect; that accordingly he had received them, not as strangers, but as relations of the same blood and parentage, and desired that they might consider themselves as masters in his dominions; for both himself and his subjects should be ready to comply with their will, and even to prevent their wishes. Cortes made a reply\nply in his usual style with respect to the dignity and power of his sovereign, and his intention in sending him into that country; artfully endeavouring so to frame his discourse, that it might coincide as much as possible with the idea which Montezuma had formed concerning the origin of the Spaniards. Next morning, Cortes and some of his principal attendants were admitted to a public audience of the emperor. The three subsequent days were employed in viewing the city; the appearance of which, so far superior in the order of its buildings and the number of its inhabitants to any place the Spaniards had beheld in America, and yet so little resembling the structure of an European city, filled them with surprise and admiration.\n\nMexico is situated in a large plain, environed by mountains of such height, that though within the torrid zone, the temperature of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> is mild and healthful. All the moisture which descends from the high grounds is collected in several lakes, the two largest of which, of about 90 miles in circuit, communicate with each other. The waters of the one are fresh, those of the other brackish. On the banks of the latter, and on some small islands adjoining to them, the capital of Montezuma's empire was built. The access to the city was by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> causeways or streets, formed of stones and earth, about 30 feet in breadth. As the waters of the lake, during the rainy season, overflowed the flat country, these causeways were of considerable length. That of Tacuba on the west a mile and a half; that of Tezcuco on the north-west three miles; that of Cuoya can towards the south six miles. On the east there was no causeway, and the city could be approached only by canoes. In each of these causeways were openings at proper intervals, through which the waters flowed; and over these beams of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> were laid, which being covered with earth, the causeway or street had everywhere an uniform appearance. As the approaches to the city were singular, its construction was remarkable. Not only the temples of their gods, but the houses belonging to the monarch, and to persons of distinction, were of such dimensions, that in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> with any other buildings which had been discovered in America, they might be termed magnificent. The habitations of the common people were mean, resembling the huts of other Indians. But they were all placed in a regular manner, on the banks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a> which passed through the city, in some of its districts, or on the sides of the streets which intersected it in other quarters. In several places were large openings or squares, one of which, allotted for the great market, is said to have been so spacious that 40,000 or 50,000 persons carried on traffic there. In this city, the pride of the New World, and the noblest monument of the industry and art of man, while unacquainted with the use of iron, the Spaniards, who are most moderate in their computations, reckon that there were at least 60,000 inhabitants.\n\nBut how much soever the novelty of those objects might amuse or astonish the Spaniards, they felt the utmost solicitude with respect to their own situation. From a concurrence of circumstances, no less unexpected than favourable to their progress, they had been allowed to penetrate into the heart of a powerful kingdom, and were now lodged in its capital, without having once met with open opposition from its monarch. Mexico. The Tlascalans, however, had artfully dissuaded them from placing such confidence in Montezuma as to enter a city of such a peculiar situation as Mexico, where that prince would have them at mercy, shut up as it were in a snare, from which it was impossible to escape. They assured them that the Mexican priests had, in the name of the gods, counselled their sovereign to admit the strangers into the capital, that he might cut them off there at one blow with perfect security. The Spaniards now perceived, too plainly, that the apprehensions of their allies were not destitute of foundation; that, by breaking the bridges placed at certain intervals on the causeways, or by destroying part of the causeways themselves, their retreat would be rendered impracticable, and they must remain cooped up in the centre of a hostile city, surrounded by multitudes sufficient to overwhelm them, and without a possibility of receiving aid from their allies.\n\nBefore he set out from Cholula, Cortes had received some hostile advice from Villa Rica, that Qualpopoca, one of the Mexican generals on the frontiers, having assembled an army in order to attack some of the people whom the Spaniards had encouraged to throw off the Mexican yoke, Ecalante had marched out with part of the garrison to support his allies; that an engagement had ensued, in which, though the Spaniards were victorious, Ecalante, with seven of his men, had been mortally wounded, his horse killed, and one Spaniard had been surrounded by the enemy and taken alive; that the head of this unfortunate captive, after being carried in triumph to different cities, in order to convince the people that their invaders were not immortal, had been sent to Mexico. Cortes, though alarmed with this intelligence, as an indication of Montezuma's hostile intentions, had continued his march. But as soon as he entered Mexico he became sensible, that, from an excess of confidence in the superior valour and discipline of his troops, as well as from the disadvantage of having nothing to guide him in an unknown country but the defective intelligence which he received from people with whom his mode of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> was very imperfect, he had pushed forward into a situation, where it was difficult to continue, and from which it was dangerous to retire. Disgrace, and perhaps ruin, was the certain consequence of attempting the latter. The success of his enterprise depended upon supporting the high opinion which the people of New Spain had formed with respect to the irresistible power of his arms. Upon the first symptom of timidity on his part, their veneration would cease, and Montezuma, whom fear alone restrained at present, would let loose upon him the whole force of his empire. At the same time, he knew that the countenance of his own sovereign was to be obtained only by a series of victories; and that nothing but the merit of extraordinary success could screen his conduct from the censure of irregularity. From all these considerations, it was necessary to maintain his station, and to extricate himself out of the difficulties in which one bold step had involved him, by venturing upon another still bolder. The situation was trying, but his mind was equal to it; and after revolving the matter with deep attention, he fixed upon a plan so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVEL\">novel</a> as to be extraordinary than daring. He determined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> Montezuma in his palace, and carry him a prisoner to the his palace.\nthe Spanish quarters. From the superstitious veneration of the Mexicans for the person of their monarch, as well as their implicit submission to his will, he hoped, by having Montezuma in his power, to acquire the supreme <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of their affairs; or at least, with such a sacred pledge in his hands, he made no doubt of being secure from any effort of their violence.\n\nThis he immediately propofoed to his officers. The timid started at a measure so audacious, and raised objections. The more intelligent and resolute, conscious that it was the only resource in which there appeared any prospect of safety, warmly approved of it, and brought over their companions so cordially to the same opinion, that it was agreed instantly to make the attempt. At his usual hour of visiting Montezuma, Cortes went to the palace, accompanied by Alvarado, Sandoval, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUGO\">Lugo</a>, Velasquez de Leon, and Davila, five of his principal officers, and as many trusty soldiers. Thirty chosen men followed, not in regular order, but sauntering at some distance, as if they had no object but curiosity; small parties were posted at proper intervals, in all the streets leading from the Spanish quarters to the court; and the remainder of his troops, with the Tlascalan allies, were under arms, ready to fall out on the first alarm. Cortes and his attendants were admitted without suspicion; the Mexicans retiring, as usual, out of respect. He addressed the monarch in a tone very different from that which he had employed in former conferences; reproaching him bitterly as the author of the violent assault made upon the Spaniards by one of his officers, and demanding public reparation for the loss which he had sustained by the death of some of his companions, as well as for the insult offered to the great prince whose servants they were. Montezuma, confounded at this unexpected <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCUSATION\">accusation</a>, and changing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> either from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> of guilt, or from feeling the indignity with which he was treated, asserted his own innocence with great earnestness; and, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of it, gave orders instantly to bring Qualpopoca and his accomplices prisoners to Mexico. Cortes replied, with seeming complaisance, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a> so respectable left no doubt remaining in his own mind; but that something more was requisite to satisfy his followers, who would never be convinced that Montezuma did not harbour hostile intentions against them, unless, as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of his confidence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a>, he removed from his own palace and took up his residence in the Spanish quarters, where he should be served and honoured as became a great monarch. The first mention of so strange a proposal bereaved Montezuma of speech, and almost of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>. At length he haughtily answered, \"That persons of his rank were not accustomed voluntarily to give up themselves as prisoners; and were he mean enough to do so, his subjects would not permit such an affront to be offered to their sovereign.\" Cortes, unwilling to employ force, endeavoured alternately to soothe and intimidate him. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERCATION\">altercation</a> became warm; and having continued above three hours, Velasquez de Leon, an impetuous and gallant young man, exclaimed with impatience, \"Why waste more time in vain? Let us either seize him instantly, or stab him to the heart?\" The threatening voice and fierce gestures with which these words were uttered, struck Montezuma. The Spaniards, he was sensible, had now proceeded so far, as left him no hope that they would recede. His own danger was imminent, the necessity unavoidable. He saw both; and abandoning himself to his fate, complied with their request.\n\nHis officers were called. He communicated to them the importance of his resolution. Though astonished and afflicted, they carried him in silent pomp, all bathed in tears, to the Spanish quarters.\n\nThey at first pretended to treat Montezuma with great respect; but soon took care to let him know that he was entirely in their power. Cortes wished that the shedding the blood of a Spaniard should appear the most heinous crime that could be committed; and therefore not only took a most exemplary vengeance on those who had been concerned in the affair of Villa Rica, but even put the emperor himself in chains till the execution of the Mexican general was over. By these, and other insults, he at last gained the entire ascendancy over this unhappy monarch; and he took care to improve his opportunity to the utmost. He sent his emissaries into different parts of the kingdom, accompanied with Mexicans of distinction, who might serve both to guide and to protect them. They visited most of the provinces, viewed their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> and productions, surveyed with particular care the districts which yielded gold or silver, pitched upon several places as proper for future <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a>, and endeavoured to prepare the minds of the people for submitting to the Spanish yoke; and while they were thus employed, Cortes, in the name and by the authority of Montezuma, degraded some of the principal officers in the empire, whose abilities or independent spirit excited his jealousy; and substituted in their place persons who he imagined would be more obsequious. One thing, however, was still wanting to complete his security. He wished to have such a command of the lake as might ensure a retreat, if, either from levity or disaffection, the Mexicans should take arms against him, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> down the bridges or causeways, in order to enclose him in the city. In order to obtain this without giving disaffection to the emperor or his court, obtains Cortes artfully inflamed the curiosity of the Indians with accounts of the Spanish shipping, and those floating palaces that moved with such velocity on the water, without the assistance of oars; and when he found that the monarch himself was extremely desirous of seeing such a novelty, he gave him to understand, that nothing was wanting to its gratification besides a few necessaries from Vera Cruz, for that he had workmen in his army capable of building such vessels. The bait took with Montezuma; and he gave immediate orders that all his people should assist Cortes in whatever he should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> concerning the shipping. By this means, in a few days, two brigantines were got ready, full rigged and equipped; and Montezuma was invited on board, to make the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> of their sailing, of which he could form no idea. Accordingly he embarked for this purpose, and gave orders for a great hunting upon the water, in order that all his people might be diverted with the novelty presented by the Spaniards. On the day appointed, the royal equipage was ready early in the morning; and the lake was covered with a multitude of boats and canoes loaded with people. The Mexicans had augmented\nMexico. the number of their rowers on board the royal barges, with an intention to disgrace the Spanish vessels, which they regarded as clumsy, unwieldy, and heavy. But they were soon undeceived; a fresh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALE\">gale</a> started up, the brigantines hoisted sail, to the utter astonishment of all the spectators, and soon left all the canoes behind; while the monarch exulted in the victory of the Spaniards, without once considering that now he had effectually riveted his own chains.\n\nCortes having obtained this important point, resolved to put the condescension of the emperor to a trial still more severe. He urged Montezuma to acknowledge himself a vassal to the crown of Castile; to hold his crown of him as superior, and to subject his dominions to the payment of an annual tribute. With this requisition, humiliating as it was, Montezuma complied. He called together the chief men of his empire, and, in a solemn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARANGUE\">harangue</a>, reminded them of the traditions and prophecies which led them to expect the arrival of a people sprung from the same stock with themselves, in order to take possession of the supreme power; he declared his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> that the Spaniards were this promised race; and that therefore he recognized the right of their monarch to govern the Mexican empire, would lay his crown at his feet, and obey him as a tributary. While uttering these words, Montezuma discovered how deeply he was affected in making such a sacrifice. Tears and groans frequently interrupted his discourse. The first mention of such a resolution struck the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> dumb with astonishment. This was followed by a sullen murmur of sorrow mingled with indignation; which indicated some violent eruption of rage to be near at hand. This Cortes forewarned, and seasonably interposed to prevent it, by declaring that his master had no intention to deprive Montezuma of the royal dignity, or to make any innovation upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> and laws of the Mexican empire. This assurance, added to their dread of the Spanish arms, and the authority of their monarch's example, extorted the consent of the assembly; and the act of submission and homage was executed with all the formalities which the Spaniards pleaded to prescribe.\n\nMontezuma, at the request of Cortes, accompanied this profession of fealty and homage with a magnificent present to his new sovereign; and, after his example, his subjects brought in very liberal contributions. The Spaniards then collected all the treasure which had been either voluntarily bestowed upon them at different times by Montezuma, or had been extorted from his people under various pretences; and having melted the gold and silver, the value of these amounted to 600,000 pesos. The soldiers were impatient to have it divided; and Cortes complied with their desire. A fifth of the whole was set apart as the tax due to the king. Another fifth was allowed to Cortes as commander. The sums advanced by the governor of Cuba who had originally fitted out the expedition, were then deducted. The remainder was then divided among the army, including the garrison of Vera Cruz, in proportion to their different ranks; and after so many deductions, the share of a private man did not exceed 100 pesos. This sum fell far below their sanguine expectations, that it required all the address, and no small exertions of the liberality of Cortes, to prevent an open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTINY\">mutiny</a>. However, he at last restored tranquillity; but had no sooner escaped this danger, than he involved himself, by his imprudent zeal for religion, in one much worse. Montezuma, though often importuned, had obstinately refused to change his religion, or abolish the superstitious rites which had been for such a long time practised throughout his dominions. This at last transported the Spaniard with such rage, that, in a folly of zeal, he led out his soldiers in order to throw down the idols in the great temple by force. But the priests, taking arms in defence of their altars, and the people crowding with great ardour to support them, Cortes's prudence overruled his zeal, and induced him to desist from his rash attempt, after dislodging the idols from one of the shrines, and placing in their stead an image of the Virgin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>.\n\nFrom this moment the Mexicans began to meditate which proved fatal to the captive monarch, it was thought proper first to try more gentle means. Having called Cortes into his presence, he observed, that now, as all the purposes of his embassy were fully accomplished, the gods had declared their will, and the people signified their desire, that he and his followers should instantly depart out of the empire. With this command he required them to comply, or unavoidable destruction would fall suddenly on their heads. This unexpected requisition, as well as the manner in which it was delivered, alarmed Cortes. However, he supposed that more might be gained by a feigned compliance than by open resistance; and therefore replied with great composure, that he had already begun to prepare for his return; but as he had destroyed the vessels in which he arrived, some time was requisite for building other ships. This appeared reasonable; and a number of Mexicans were sent to Vera Cruz to cut down timber, and some Spanish carpenters were appointed to superintend the work.\n\nCortes flattered himself, that, during this interval, he might either find means to avert the threatened danger, or receive such reinforcements as would enable him to defend himself. Nine months had now elapsed since Portocarrero and Montejo had failed with his despatches to Spain; and he daily expected a return, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of his authority from the king, without which all that he had done served only to mark him out as an object of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>. While he remained in great anxiety on this account, news were brought that some ships had appeared on the coast. These were imagined by Cortes to be a reinforcement sent him from Spain; but his joy was of short continuance, for a courier very soon arrived from Vera Cruz, with certain information that the armament was fitted out by Velasquez, the governor of Cuba; and instead of bringing succours, threatened them with immediate destruction.\n\nVelasquez had been excited to this hostile measure chiefly through the indiscretion, or rather treachery, of the messengers of Cortes; who, contrary to his express injunctions, had landed on the island of Cuba, and given intelligence of all that had passed; and Velasquez, transported with rage at hearing of the proceedings of Cortes, had now sent against him this armament; consisting of 18 ships, which carried 80 horsemen,\nmen, 800 infantry, of which 80 were musketeers, and 120 crossbowmen, commanded by a brave officer named Pamphilo de Narvaez; whose instructions were, to seize Cortes and his principal officers, to send them prisoners to him, and then to complete the discovery and conquest of the country in his name. This proved a most afflicting piece of news to Cortes.\n\nHaving now no resource but in war, he left 150 men under the command of Pedro de Alvarado, an officer of great bravery, and much respected by the Mexicans, to guard the capital and the captive emperor; while he himself marched with the remainder, to meet his formidable opponent, who had taken possession of Zempoalla. Even after being reinforced by Sandoval his governor of Vera Cruz, the force of Cortes did not exceed 250 men. He hoped for success chiefly from the rapidity of his motions and the possibility of surprising his enemies; and as he chiefly dreaded their cavalry, he armed his soldiers with long spears, accustomed them to that deep and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> arrangement which the use of this formidable weapon enabled them to assume. As he advanced, however, he repeated his proposals of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a>; but these being constantly rejected, and a price set upon his head, he at last attacked Narvaez in the night-time, entirely defeated and took him prisoner, obliging all his troops to own allegiance to himself.\n\nNothing could be more seasonable than this victory, by which Cortes found his army very considerably increased; for most of the soldiers of Narvaez chose rather to follow Cortes than to return to Cuba, whether the conqueror had offered to send them if they chose. His affairs at Mexico, in the mean time, were in the utmost danger of being totally ruined; and had this decisive victory been delayed but a few days longer, he must have come too late to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> his companions. A short time after the defeat of Narvaez, a courier arrived from Mexico with the disagreeable intelligence that the Mexicans had taken arms; and having seized and destroyed the two brigantines which he had built in order to secure the command of the lake, had attacked the Spaniards in their quarters, killed some, and wounded many more, burnt their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">magazine</a> of provisions, and, in short, carried on hostilities with such fury, that though Alvarado and his men defended themselves with undaunted resolution, they must either be cut off by famine, or sink under the multitude of their enemies. This revolt was excited by motives which rendered it still more alarming. On the departure of Cortes for Zempoalla, the Mexicans flattered themselves, that the long-expected opportunity of restoring their sovereign to liberty, and driving out the Spaniards, was arrived; and consultations were accordingly held for bringing about both these events. The Spaniards in Mexico, conscious of their own weakness, suspected and dreaded these machinations; but Alvarado, who had neither the prudence nor the address of Cortes, took the worst method imaginable to overcome them. Instead of attempting to soothe or cajole the Mexicans, he waited the return of one of their solemn festivals, when the principal persons in the empire were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DANCING\">dancing</a>, according to custom, in the court of the great temple; he seized all the avenues which led to it; and, allyred partly by the rich ornaments which they wore in honour of their gods, and partly by the facility of cutting off at once the authors of that conspiracy which he dreaded, he fell upon them, unarmed and unsuspicous of danger, and massacred a great number; none escaping but such as made their way over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLEMENTS\">battlements</a> of the temple. An action so cruel and treacherous filled not only the city, but the whole empire, with indignation and rage; and the Mexicans immediately proceeded in the manner above mentioned.\n\nCortes advanced with the utmost celerity to the relief of his distressed companions: but as he passed along, had the mortification to find that the Spaniards were generally held in abhorrence. The principal inhabitants had deserted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> through which he passed; no person of note appeared to meet him with the usual respect; nor were provisions brought to his camp as usual. Notwithstanding these signs of aversion and horror, however, the Mexicans were so ignorant of the military art, that they again permitted him to enter the capital without opposition; though it was in their power to have easily prevented him, by breaking down the bridges and causeways which led to it.\n\nCortes was received by his companions with the utmost joy; and this extraordinary success to far intoxicated the general himself, that he not only neglected to visit Montezuma, but expressed himself very contemptuously concerning him. These expressions being reported among the Mexicans, they all at once flew to arms, and made such a violent and sudden attack, that all the valour and skill of Cortes were scarce sufficient to repel them. This produced great uneasiness among the soldiers of Narvaez, who had imagined there was nothing to do but to gather the spoils of a conquered country. Discontent and murmurings, however, were now of no avail; they were enclosed in a hostile city, and, without some extraordinary exertions, were inevitably undone. Cortes therefore, made a desperate sally; but, after exerting his utmost efforts for a whole day, was obliged to retire with the loss of 12 killed, and upwards of 60 wounded. Another sally was attempted with the like bad success, and in it Cortes himself was wounded in the hand.\n\nThe Spanish general was now thoroughly convinced of his error; and therefore betook himself to the only resource which was left; namely, to try what effect the interposition of Montezuma would have to soothe or overawe his subjects. When the Mexicans approached the next morning to renew the assault, that unfortunate prince, at the mercy of the Spaniards, and reduced to the sad necessity of becoming the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of his own disgrace, and of the slavery of his people advanced to the battlements in his royal robes, and with all the pomp in which he used to appear on solemn occasions. At the sight of their sovereign, whom they had been long accustomed to reverence almost as a god, the Mexicans instantly forebore their hostilities, and many prostrated themselves on the ground; but when he addressed them in favour of the Spaniards, and made use of all the arguments he could think of to mitigate their rage, they testified their resentment with loud murmurs; and at length broke forth into a massacre.\nMexico forth with such fury, that before the soldiers, appointed to guard Montezuma, had time to cover him with their shields, he was wounded with two arrows, and a blow on his temple with a stone struck him to the ground. On seeing him fall, the Mexicans instantly fled with the utmost precipitation; but the unhappy monarch, now convinced that he was become an object of contempt even to his own subjects, obstinately refused all nourishment; and thus in a short time ended his days.\n\nOn the death of Montezuma, Cortes having lost all hope of bringing the Mexicans to any terms of peace, prepared for retreat. But his antagonists, having taken possession of a high tower in the great temple, which overlooked the Spanish quarters, and placing there a garrison of their principal warriors, the Spaniards were so much exposed to their missiles, that none could flit without danger of being killed or wounded. From this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a>, therefore, it was necessary to dislodge them at any rate; and Juan de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESCOBAR\">Escobar</a>, with a large detachment of chosen soldiers, was ordered to make the attack. But Escobar, though a valiant officer, and though he exerted his utmost efforts, was thrice repulsed. Cortes, however, sensible that not only his reputation, but the safety of his army, depended on the success of this assault, caused a buckler to be tied to his arm, as he could not manage it with his wounded hand, and rushed with his drawn sword among the thickest of the combatants. Encouraged by the presence of their general, the Spaniards returned to the charge with such vigour, that they gradually forced their way up the steps, and drove the Mexicans to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PLATFORM\">platform</a> at the top of the tower. There a dreadful carnage began; when two young Mexicans of high rank, observing Cortes, as he animated his soldiers, resolved to sacrifice their own lives in order to cut off the author of so many calamities which desolated their country. They approached him in a suppliant posture, as if they intended to lay down their arms; and seizing him in a moment, hurried him towards the battlements, over which they threw themselves headlong, in hopes of dragging him along with them. But Cortes, by his strength and agility, disengaged himself from their grasp; so that the two Mexicans perished alone.\n\nAs soon as the Spaniards became masters of the tower, they set fire to it, and without further molestation continued the preparations for their retreat. This became the more necessary, as their enemies, astonished at this last effort of their valour, had now entirely changed their system of hostility; and, instead of incessant attacks, endeavoured, by barricading the streets, and breaking down the causeways, to cut off the communication of the Spaniards with the continent, and thus to starve an enemy whom they could not subdue. The first point to be determined, was whether they should march out openly in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of day, when they could discern every danger, or whether they should endeavour to retire secretly in the night. The latter was preferred, partly from hopes that the superstition of the Mexicans would prevent them from attacking them in the night, and partly from their own superstition in giving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> to the predictions of a private soldier, who pretended to astrology, and assured them of success if they retreated in this manner.\n\nTowards midnight, therefore, they began their march, Mexico in three divisions. Sandoval led the van; Pedro Alvarado and Velazquez de Leon had the conduct of the rear; and Cortes commanded in the centre, where he placed the prisoners, among whom were a son and two daughters of Montezuma, together with several Mexicans of distinction, the artillery, baggage, and a portable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> of timber intended to be laid over the breaches in the causeway. They marched in profound silence along the causeway which led to Tacuba, because it was shorter than any of the rest, and, lying most remote from the road towards Tlacalala and the sea coast, had been left most entire by the Mexicans.\n\nThey reached the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> in the causeway without molestation, hoping that their retreat was undisturbed with covered. But the Mexicans had not only watched all their motions, but made preparations for a formidable attack. While the Spaniards were intent upon placing their bridges in the breach, and occupied in conducting their horses and artillery along it, they were suddenly alarmed with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> of warlike instruments, and found themselves assaulted on all sides by an innumerable multitude of enemies. Unfortunately the wooden bridge was wedged too fast in the mud by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of the artillery, that it was impossible to remove it. Dismayed at this accident, the Spaniards advanced with precipitation to the second breach. The Mexicans hemmed them in on every side; and though they defended themselves with their usual courage, yet, crowded as they were in a narrow causeway, their discipline and military skill were of little avail; nor did the obscurity of the night allow them to derive much advantage from their firearms or the superiority of their other weapons. At last the Spaniards, overcome with the numbers of their enemies, began to give way, and in a moment the confusion was universal. Cortes, with about 100 foot soldiers, and a few horse, forced his way over the two remaining breaches in the causeway, the bodies of the dead serving to fill up the chasms, and reached the main land. Having formed them as soon as they arrived, he returned with such as were yet capable of service, to assist his friends in their retreat. He met with part of his soldiers who had forced their way through the enemy, but found many more overwhelmed by the multitude of their aggressors, or perishing in the lake; and heard the grievous lamentations of others whom the Mexicans were carrying off in triumph to be sacrificed to the god of war.\n\nIn this fatal retreat more than one half of Cortes's army perished, together with many officers of distinction. All the artillery, ammunition, and baggage, were lost; the greater part of the horses and above 2000 Tlacalans were killed, and only a very small part of their treasure saved. The first care of the Spanish general was to find some shelter for his wearied troops; for, as the Mexicans infested them on every side, and the people of Tacuba began to take arms, he could not continue in his present station. At last he discovered a temple seated on an eminence, in which he found not only the shelter he wanted, but some provisions; and though the enemy did not intermit their attacks throughout the day, they were without much difficulty prevented from making any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a>. For\nMexico six days after, they continued their march through a barren, ill cultivated, and thinly peopled country, where they were often obliged to feed on berries, roots, and the stalks of green maize; at the same time they were harafted without intermission by large parties of Mexicans, who attacked them on all sides. On the fifth day they reached Otumba, not far from the road between Mexico and Tlalcalca. Early next morning they began to advance towards it, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> parties of the enemy still hanging on their rear; and amidst the insults with which they accompanied their hostilities, Donna Marina remarked, that they often exclaimed with exultation, \"Go on, robbers; go to the place where you shall quickly meet the vengeance due to your crimes.\" The meaning of this threat the Spaniards did not comprehend, until they reached the summit of an eminence before them. There a spacious valley opened to their view, covered with a vast army as far as the eye could reach. The Mexicans, while with one body of their troops they harafted the Spaniards in their retreat, had assembled their principal force on the other side of the lake; and marching along the road which led directly to Tlalcalca, posted it in the plain of Otumba, through which they knew Cortes must pass. At the sight of this incredible multitude, which they could survey at once from the rising ground, the Spaniards were astonished, and even the boldest began to despair. But Cortes, without allowing their fears time to operate, after warning them briefly that no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALTERNATIVE\">alternative</a> remained but to conquer or die, led them instantly to the charge. The Mexicans waited their approach with unusual fortitude: yet such was the superiority of the Spanish discipline and arms, that the impression of this small body was irresistible; and whichever way its force was directed, it penetrated and dispersed the most numerous battalions. But while these gave way in one quarter, new combatants advanced from another; and the Spaniards, though successful in every attack, were ready to sink under these repeated efforts, without seeing any end to their toil, or any hope of victory. At that time Cortes observed the great standard of the empire, which was carried before the Mexican general, advancing; and fortunately recollecting to have heard, that on the fate of it depended the event of every battle, he assembled a few of his bravest officers, whose horses were still capable of service, and, placing himself at their head, pushed towards the standard with such impetuosity that he bore down everything before him. A chosen body of nobles, who guarded the standard, made some resistance, but were soon broken. Cortes, with a stroke of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANCE\">lance</a>, wounded the Mexican general, and threw him to the ground. One of his followers alighting, put an end to his life, and laid hold of the imperial standard. The moment that their leader fell, and the standard, towards which all directed their eyes, disappeared, an universal panic struck the Mexicans; and, as if the bond which held them together had been dissolved, every ensign was lowered, each soldier threw away his weapons, and fled with precipitation to the mountains. The Spaniards, unable to pursue them far, returned to collect the spoils of the field; and these were so valuable as to be some compensation for the wealth which they had lost in Mexico; for in the enemy's army were most of their principal warriors dressed out in their richest ornaments, as if they had been marching to assured victory.\n\nThe day after this important action (being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 8, 1520), the Spaniards entered the Tlalcalcan territories, where they were received with the most cordial friendship. Cortes endeavoured to avail himself of this disposition as much as possible; for which purpose he distributed among them the rich spoils taken at Otumba with such a liberal hand, that he made himself sure of obtaining from the republic whatever he should desire. He drew a small supply of ammunition, and two or three field-pieces, from his stores at Vera Cruz. He despatched an officer of confidence with four ships of Narvaez's fleet to Hispaniola and Jamaica, to engage adventurers, and to purchase horses, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a>, and other military stores. And as he knew that it would be in vain to attempt the reduction of Mexico, unless he could secure the command of the lake, he gave orders to prepare, in the mountains of Tlalcalca, materials for building 12 brigantines, so that they might be carried thither in pieces, ready to be put together, and launched when he stood in need of their service. But, in the mean time, his soldiers, alarmed at the thoughts of being exposed to such calamities a second time, presented a remonstrance to their general, in which they represented the imprudence of attacking a powerful empire with his shattered forces, and formally required him to return back to Cuba. All the eloquence of Cortes could now only prevail with them to delay their departure for some time, when he promised to dismiss such as should desire it. However, this was only a pretence; for Cortes, in fact, had the conquest of Mexico as much at heart as ever. Without giving his soldiers an opportunity of caballing, therefore, he daily employed them against the people of the neighbouring provinces, who had cut off some detachments of Spaniards during his misfortunes at Mexico; and by which, as he was constantly attended with success, his men soon resumed their wonted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of superiority.\n\nBut all the efforts of Cortes could have been of little avail, had he not unexpectedly obtained a reinforcement of Spanish soldiers. These belonged to an armament fitted out by Francisco de Garay, governor of Jamaica, who had long aimed at dividing with Cortes the glory and gain of annexing the empire of Mexico to the crown of Castile. They had, however, unwisely made their attempt on the northern provinces, where the country was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> and the inhabitants fierce and warlike; so that, after a succession of disasters, they were now obliged to venture into Vera Cruz, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> themselves upon the mercy of their countrymen; and here they also were soon persuaded to throw off their allegiance to their master, and to enlist with Cortes. About the same time a ship arrived from Spain, freighted by some private adventurers, with military stores; and the cargo was eagerly purchased by Cortes, while the crew, following the example of the rest, joined him at Tlalcalca.\n\nFrom these various quarters, the army of Cortes was augmented with 180 men and 20 horses; by which means he was enabled to dismiss such of the soldiers of Narvaez as were most troublesome and discontented; after the departure of whom he still muttered 550 infantry, of whom 80 were armed with muskets or crossbows.\nMexico.\n\nAt the head of these, with 10,000 Tlascalans and other friendly Indians, he began his march towards Mexico, on the 28th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a>, six months after his fatal retreat from that city.\n\nAs soon as Cortes entered the enemy's territories, he discovered various preparations to obstruct his progress. But his troops forced their way with little difficulty; and took possession of Tezcuco, the second city of the empire, situated on the banks of the lake, about 20 miles from Mexico. Here he determined to establish his head-quarters, as the most proper station for launching his brigantines, as well as for making his approaches to the capital. In order to render his residence there more secure, he deposed the cacique or chief, who was at the head of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>, under pretence of some defect in his title, and substituted in his place a person whom a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTION\">faction</a> of the nobles pointed out as the right heir of that dignity. Attached to him by this benefit, the new cacique and his adherents served the Spaniards with inviolable fidelity.\n\nAs the construction of the brigantines advanced slowly under the unskilful hands of soldiers and Indians, whom Cortes was obliged to employ in afflicting three or four carpenters who happened fortunately to be in his service, and as he had not yet received the reinforcement which he expected from Hispaniola, he was not in a condition to turn his arms directly against the capital. To have attacked a city so populous, so well prepared for defence, and in a situation of such peculiar strength, must have exposed his troops to inevitable destruction. Three months elapsed before the materials for constructing the brigantines were finished, and before he heard anything with respect to the success of his negotiation in Hispaniola. This, however, was not a season of inaction to Cortes. He attacked successively several of the towns situated around the lake; and though all the Mexican power was exerted to obstruct his operations, he either compelled them to submit to the Spanish crown, or reduced them to ruins. Other towns he endeavoured to conciliate by more gentle means; and though he could not hold any intercourse with the inhabitants but by the intervention of interpreters, yet, under all the disadvantages of that tedious and imperfect mode of communication, he had acquired such thorough knowledge of the state of the country, as well as of the dispositions of the people, that he conducted his negotiations and intrigues with astonishing dexterity and success. Most of the cities adjacent to Mexico were originally the capitals of small independent states; and some of them having been but lately annexed to the Mexican empire, still retained the remembrance of their ancient liberty, and bore with impatience the rigorous yoke of their new masters. Cortes having early observed symptoms of their disaffection, availed himself of this knowledge to gain their confidence and friendship. By offering with confidence to deliver them from the odious dominion of the Mexicans, and by liberal promises of more indulgent treatment if they would unite with him against their oppressors, he prevailed on the people of several considerable districts, not only to acknowledge the king of Castile as their sovereign, but to supply the Spanish camp with provisions, and to strengthen his army with auxiliary troops. Guatimozin, on the first appearance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFECTION\">defection</a> among his subjects, exerted himself with vigour to prevent or to punish their revolt; but, in spite of his efforts, the spirit continued to spread. The Spaniards gradually acquired new allies; and with deep concern he beheld Cortes arming against his empire those very hands which ought to have been active in his defence, and ready to advance against the capital at the head of a numerous body of his own subjects.\n\nWhile, by these various methods, Cortes was gradually circumscribing the Mexican power within such narrow limits that his prospect of overturning it seemed neither to be uncertain nor remote, all his schemes were well nigh defeated by a conspiracy against his own person, and which was discovered only a short time before it was to have been executed. Though many were concerned, Cortes did not think proper to punish any more than the principal ringleader, whom he caused immediately to be hanged; and then, without allowing them leisure to ruminate on what had happened, and as the most effectual means of preventing the return of a mutinous spirit, he determined to call forth his troops immediately to action. Fortunately a proper occasion for this occurred, without his seeming to court it. He received intelligence, that the materials for building the brigantines were at length completely finished, and waited only for a body of Spaniards to conduct them to Tezcuco. The command of this convoy, consisting of 200 foot soldiers, 15 horsemen, and two field pieces, he gave to Sandoval, who by the vigilance, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>, and courage, which he manifested on every occasion, was growing daily in his confidence, and in the estimation of his fellow-soldiers. The Tlascalans furnished 8000 Tamezes, an inferior order of men destined for servile tasks, to carry the materials on their shoulders, and appointed 15,000 warriors to accompany and defend them. Sandoval made the disposition for their progress with great propriety, placing the Tamezes in the centre, one body of warriors in the front, another in the rear, with considerable parties to cover the flanks. To each of these he joined some Spaniards, not only to assist them in danger, but to accustom them to regularity and subordination. Parties of Mexicans frequently appeared hovering around them on the high grounds; but perceiving no prospect of success in attacking an enemy continually on his guard, and prepared to receive them, they did not venture to molest him; and Sandoval had the glory of conducting safely to Tezcuco a convoy on which all the future operations of his countrymen depended.\n\nCortes determined to attack the city from three different quarters; from Tezcuco on the east side of the lake, from Tacuba on the west, and from Cuayocan towards the south. Those towns were situated on the principal causeways which led to the capital, and intended for their defence. He appointed Sandoval to command in the first, Pedro de Alvarado in the second, and Crist\u00f3bal de Olid in the third; allotting to each a numerous body of Indian auxiliaries, together with an equal division of Spaniards, who, by the junction of the troops from Hispaniola, amounted now to 86 horsemen, and 818 foot soldiers; of whom 118 were armed with muskets or cross bows. Their train of artillery consisted of three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTERING\">battering</a> cannon, and 15 field-\npieces. He referred for himself, as the station of greatest importance and danger, the conduct of the brigantines, each armed with one of his small cannon, and manned with 25 Spaniards.\n\nAs Alvarado and Olid proceeded towards the posts assigned them, they broke down the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-AQUEDUCTS\">aqueducts</a> which the ingenuity of the Mexicans had erected for conveying water into the capital, and, by the distresses to which this reduced the inhabitants, gave a beginning to the calamities which they were destined to suffer. Alvarado and Olid found the towns, of which they were ordered to take possession, deserted by their inhabitants, who had fled for safety to the capital, where Guatimozin had collected the chief force of his empire, as there alone he could hope to make a successful stand against the formidable enemies who were approaching to assail him.\n\nThe first effort of the Mexicans was to destroy the fleet of brigantines, the fatal effects of whose operations they foresaw and dreaded. Though the brigantines, after all the labour and merit of Cortes in constructing them, were of considerable bulk, rudely constructed, and manned chiefly with landmen, hardly possessed of skill enough to conduct them, they must have been objects of terror to a people unacquainted with any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> but that of their lake, and possessed of no vessel larger than a canoe. Necessity, however, urged Guatimozin to hazard the attack; and hoping to supply by numbers what he wanted in force, he assembled such a multitude of canoes as covered the face of the lake. They rowed on boldly to the charge, while the brigantines, retarded by a dead calm, could scarcely advance to meet them. But as the enemy drew near, a breeze suddenly sprung up; in a moment the sails were spread, and the brigantines with irresistible impetuosity broke their feeble opponents, overset many canoes, and dissipated the whole armament with such slaughter, as convinced the Mexicans, that the progress of the Europeans in knowledge and arts rendered their superiority greater on this new element than they had hitherto found it by land.\n\nFrom that time Cortes remained master of the lake; and the brigantines not only prevented a communication between the Spaniards in their different stations, though at a considerable distance from each other; but were employed to cover the causeways on each side, and keep off the canoes, when they attempted to annoy the troops as they advanced towards the city. He formed the brigantines in three divisions, allotting one to each station, with orders to second the operations of the officer who commanded there. From all the three stations he pushed on the attack against the city with equal vigour; but in a manner so very different from that by which sieges are conducted in regular war, as might appear no less improper than singular to persons unacquainted with his situation. Each morning his troops assaulted the barricades which the enemy had erected on the causeways, forced their way over the trenches which they had dug, and through the canals where the bridges were broken down, and endeavoured to penetrate into the heart of the city, in hopes of obtaining some decisive advantage, which might force the enemy to surrender, and terminate the war at once; but when the obstinate valour of the Mexicans rendered the efforts of the day ineffectual, the Spaniards retired in the evening to their former quarters. Thus their toil and danger were, in some measure, continually renewed, the Mexicans repairing in the night what the Spaniards had destroyed through the day, and recovering the posts from which they had driven them. But necessity prescribed this slow and untoward mode of operation. The number of his troops was so small, that Cortes durst not, with a handful of men, attempt to make a lodgement in a city where he might be surrounded and annoyed by such a multitude of enemies. The remembrance of what he had already suffered by the ill-judged confidence with which he had ventured into such a dangerous situation, was still fresh in his mind. The Spaniards, exhausted with fatigue, were unable to guard the various posts which they daily gained; and though their camp was filled with Indian auxiliaries, they durst not devolve this charge upon them, because they were so little accustomed to discipline, that no confidence could be placed in their vigilance. Besides this, Cortes was extremely solicitous to preserve the city as much as possible from being destroyed, both as he deemed it to be the capital of his conquests, and wished that it might remain as a monument of his glory. From all these considerations, he adhered obstinately, for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> after the siege was opened, to the system which he had adopted. The Mexicans, in their own defence, displayed valour which was hardly inferior to that with which the Spaniards attacked them. On land, on water, by night and by day, one furious conflict succeeded to another. Several Spaniards were killed, more wounded, and all were ready to sink under the toils of uninterrupted service, which were rendered more intolerable by the injuries of the season, the periodical rains being now set in with their usual violence.\n\nAstonished and disconcerted with the length and difficulties of the siege, Cortes determined to make one great effort to get possession of the city before he relinquished the plan which he had hitherto followed, and had recourse to any other mode of attack. With this view he sent instructions to Alvarado and Sandoval to advance with their divisions to a general assault, and took the command in person of that posted on the causeway of Cuyocan. Animated by his presence, and the expectation of some decisive event, the Spaniards pushed forward with irresistible impetuosity. They broke through one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARRICADE\">barricade</a> after another, forced their way over the ditches and canals, and having entered the city, gained ground incessantly, in spite of the multitude and ferocity of their opponents. Cortes, though delighted with the rapidity of his progress, did not forget that he might still find it necessary to retreat; and in order to secure it, appointed Julian de Alderete, a captain of chief note in the troops which he had received from Hispaniola, to fill up the canals and gaps in the causeway as the main body advanced. That officer deeming it inglorious to be thus employed, while his companions were in the heat of action and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> of victory, neglected the important charge committed to him, and hurried on inconsiderately to mingle with the combatants. The Mexicans, whose military attention and skill were daily improving, no sooner observed this, than they carried an account of it to their monarch.\n\nGuatimozin instantly discerned the consequences of\nthe error which the Spaniards had committed, and, with admirable presence of mind, prepared to take advantage of it. He commanded the troops posted in the front to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLACKEN\">slacken</a> their efforts, in order to allure the Spaniards to push forward, while he despatched a large body of chosen warriors through different streets, some by land, and others by water, towards the great breach in the causeway, which had been left open. On a signal which he gave, the priests in the great temple struck the great drum consecrated to the god of war. No sooner did the Mexicans near its doleful solemn sound, calculated to inspire them with contempt of death and with enthusiastic ardour, than they rushed upon the enemy with frantic rage. The Spaniards, unable to resist men urged on by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> fury than hope of success, began to retire, at first leisurely, and with a good countenance; but as the enemy pressed on, and their own impatience to escape increased, the terror and confusion became so general, that when they arrived at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAP\">gap</a> in the causeway, Spaniards and Tlascalans, horsemen and infantry, plunged in promiscuously, while the Mexicans rushed upon them fiercely from every side, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> canoes carrying them through shoals which the brigantines could not approach. In vain did Cortes attempt to stop and rally his flying troops; fear rendered them regardless of his entreaties or commands. Finding all his endeavours to renew the combat fruitless, his next care was to save some of those who had thrown themselves into the water; but while thus employed, with more attention to their situation than to his own, six Mexican captains suddenly laid hold of him, and were hurrying him off in triumph; and though two of his officers rescued him at the expense of their own lives, he received several dangerous wounds before he could break loose. Above sixty Spaniards perished in the rout; and what rendered the disaster more afflicting, forty of these fell alive into the hands of an enemy never known to show mercy to a captive.\n\nThe approach of night, though it delivered the defeated Spaniards from the attacks of the enemy, ushered in, what was hardly less grievous, the noise of their barbarous triumph, and of the horrid festival with which they celebrated their victory. Every quarter of the city was illuminated; the great temple shone with such peculiar splendour, that the Spaniards could plainly see the people in motion, and the priests busy in hastening the preparations for the death of the prisoners. Through the gloom they fancied that they discerned their companions by the whiteness of their skins, as they were stripped naked and compelled to dance before the image of the god to whom they were to be offered. They heard the shrieks of those who were sacrificed, and thought they could distinguish each unhappy victim by the well-known sound of his voice. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">Imagination</a> added to what they really saw or heard, and augmented its horror. The most unfeeling melted into tears of compassion, and the stoutest heart trembled at the dreadful spectacle which they beheld.\n\nCortes, who, besides all that he felt in common with his soldiers, was oppressed with the additional load of anxious reflections natural to a general on such an unexpected calamity, could not like them relieve his mind by giving vent to its anguish. He was obliged to assume an air of tranquillity in order to revive the spirits and hopes of his followers. The juncture, indeed, required an extraordinary exertion of fortitude. The Mexicans, elated with their victory, sallied out next morning to attack him in his quarters. But they did not rely on the efforts of their own arms alone: they sent the heads of the Spaniards whom they had sacrificed to the leading men in the adjacent provinces, and assured them that the god of war, appealed by the blood of their invaders, which had been shed so plentifully on his altars, had declared with an audible voice, that in eight days time those hated enemies should be finally destroyed, and peace and prosperity re-established in the empire.\n\nA prediction, uttered with such confidence, and in terms so void of ambiguity, gained universal credit among a people prone to superstition. The zeal of the provinces which had already declared against the Spaniards augmented, and several which had hitherto remained inactive took arms with enthusiastic ardour to execute the decrees of the gods. The Indian auxiliaries who had joined Cortes, accustomed to venerate the same deities with the Mexicans, and to receive the responses of their priests with the same implicit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, abandoned the Spaniards as a race of men devoted to certain destruction. Even the fidelity of the Tlascalans was shaken, and the Spanish troops were left almost alone in their stations. Cortes, finding that he attempted in vain to dispel the superstitious fears of his confederates by argument, took advantage, from the imprudence of those who had framed the prophecy in fixing its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMPLISHMENT\">accomplishment</a> so near at hand, to give them a striking demonstration of its falsity. He suspended all military operations during the period marked out by the oracle. Under cover of the brigantines, which kept the enemy at a distance, his troops lay in safety, and the fatal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> expired without any disaster.\n\nHis allies, ashamed of their own credulity, returned to their station. Other tribes, judging that the gods, who had now deceived the Mexicans, had decreed finally to withdraw their protection from them, joined his standard; and such was the levity of a simple people, moved by every flight impression, that, in a short time after such a general defection of his confederates, Cortes saw himself, if we may believe his own account, at the head of fifteen thousand Indians. Even with such a numerous army, he found it necessary to adopt a new and more wary system of operation. Instead of renewing his attempts to become master of the city at once, by such bold but dangerous efforts of valor as he had already tried, he made his advances gradually, and with every possible precaution against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> his men to any calamity similar to that which they still bewailed. As the Spaniards pushed forward, the Indians regularly repaired the causeways behind them. As soon as they got possession of any part of the town, the houses were instantly levelled with the ground. Day by day, the Mexicans, forced to retire as their enemies gained ground, were hemmed in within more narrow limits. Guatimozin, though unable to stop the career of the enemy, continued to defend his capital with obstinate resolution, and disputed every inch of ground. But the Spaniards, having not only varied their mode of attack, but, by order of Cortes, having changed the weapons\nMexico, with which they fought, were again armed with the long Chinantlan spears, which they had employed with such success against Narvaez; and, by the firm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARRAY\">array</a> in which this enabled them to range themselves, they repelled, with little danger, the looie assault of the Mexicans; incredible numbers of whom fell in the conflicts, which they renewed every day. While war waited without, famine began to consume them within the city. The Spanish brigantines, having the entire command of the lake, rendered it impossible to receive any supply of provisions by water. The vast number of his Indian auxiliaries enabled Cortes to shut up the avenues to the city by land. The stores which Guatimozin had laid up were exhausted by the multitudes which crowded into the capital to defend their sovereign and the temples of their gods. Not only the people, but persons of the highest rank, felt the utmost distresses of want. What they suffered brought on infectious and mortal distempers, the last calamity that visits beleaguered cities, and which filled up the measure of their woes.\n\nBut, under the pressure of so many and such various evils, the spirit of Guatimozin remained firm and unshaken. He rejected with scorn every overture of peace from Cortes; and, disdaining the idea of submitting to the oppressors of his country, determined not to survive its ruin. The Spaniards continued their progress. At length all the three divisions penetrated into the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> in the centre of the city, and made a secure lodgment there. Three-fourths of the city were now reduced, and laid in ruins. The remaining quarter was so closely pressed, that it could not long withstand assailants who attacked it from their new station with superior advantage, and more assured expectation of success. The Mexican nobles, solicitous to save the life of a monarch whom they revered, prevailed on Guatimozin to retire from a place where resistance was now vain, that he might rouse the more distant provinces of the empire to arms, and maintain there a more successful struggle with the public enemy. In order to facilitate the execution of this measure, they endeavoured to amuse Cortes with overtures of submission, that, while his attention was employed in adjusting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of pacification, Guatimozin might escape unperceived. But they made this attempt upon a leader of greater sagacity and discernment than to be deceived by their arts. Cortes suspecting their intention, and aware of what moment it was to defeat it, appointed Sandoval, the officer on whose vigilance he could most perfectly rely, to take the command of the brigantines, with strict injunctions to watch every motion of the enemy. Sandoval, attentive to the charge, observing some large canoes crowded with people rowing along the lake with extraordinary rapidity, instantly gave the signal to chase. Gracia Holguin, who commanded the fleetest brigantine, soon overtook them, and was preparing to fire on the foremost canoe, which seemed to carry some person whom all the rest followed and obeyed. At once the rowers dropt their oars, and all on board, throwing down their arms, conjured him with cries and tears to forbear, as the emperor was there. Holguin eagerly seized his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a>; and Guatimozin, with a dignified composure, gave himself up into his hands, praying only that no insult might be offered to the empress or his children. When conducted to Cortes, he appeared neither with the fullen fierceness of a barbarian, nor with the dejection of a supplicant. \"I have done,\" said he, addressing himself to the Spanish general, \"what became a monarch. I have defended my people to the last extremity. Nothing now remains but to die. Take this dagger,\" laying his hand on one which Cortes wore, \"plant it in my breast, and put an end to a life which can no longer be of use.\"\n\nAs soon as the fate of their sovereign was known, Mexico, the resistance of the Mexicans ceased; and Cortes took possession of that small part of the capital which yet remained undestroyed. Thus terminated the siege of Mexico, the most memorable event in the conquest of America. It continued 75 days, hardly one of which passed without some extraordinary effort of one party in the attack, or of the other in the defence of a city, on the fate of which both knew that the fortune of the empire depended. As the struggle here was more obstinate, it was likewise more equal, than any between the inhabitants of the Old and New Worlds. The great abilities of Guatimozin, the number of his troops, the peculiar situation of his capital, so far counterbalanced the superiority of the Spaniards in arms and discipline, that they must have relinquished the enterprise, if they had trusted to success to themselves alone. But Mexico was overturned by the jealousy of neighbours who dreaded its power, and by the revolt of subjects impatient to shake off its yoke. By their effectual aid, Cortes was enabled to accomplish what, without such support, he would hardly have ventured to attempt. How muchsoever this account of the reduction of Mexico may detract, on the one hand, from the marvellous relations of some Spanish writers, by ascribing that to simple and obvious causes which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> to the romantic valour of their countrymen, it adds, on the other, to the merit and abilities of Cortes, who, under every disadvantage, acquired such an ascendant over unknown nations, as to render them instruments towards carrying his scheme into execution.\n\nThe exultation of the Spaniards, on accomplishing this arduous enterprise, was at first excessive. But this was quickly damped by the cruel disappointment of those sanguine hopes which had animated them amidst so many hardships and dangers. Instead of the inexhaustible wealth which they expected from becoming masters of Montezuma's treasures, and the ornaments of so many temples, their rapaciousness could collect only an inconsiderable booty amidst ruins and desolation (A). Guatimozin, aware of his impending fate, had ordered what remained of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> amassed by his ancestors to be thrown into the lake. The Indian auxiliaries, while the Spaniards were engaged in conflict,\n\n(a) The gold and silver according to Cortes, amounted only to 120,000 pesos, (Relat. 280, A.) a sum far inferior to that which the Spaniards had formerly divided in Mexico.\nMexico, fleet with the enemy, had carried off the most valuable part of the spoil. The sum to be divided among the conquerors was so small, that many of them disdained to accept of the pittance which fell to their share, and all murmured and exclaimed; some against Cortes and his confidants, whom they suspected of having fe-cretly appropriated to their own use a large portion of the riches which should have been brought into the com- mon stock; others against Guatimozin, whom they ac-cused of obstinacy, in refusing to discover the place where he had hidden his treasure.\n\nArguments, entreaties, and promises, were employed in order to soothe them; but with so little effect, that Cortes, from solicitude to check this growing spirit of discontent, gave way to a deed which stained the glory of all his great actions. Without regarding the former dignity of Guatimozin, or feeling any re-verence for those virtues which he had displayed, he subjected the unhappy monarch, together with his chief favourite, to torture, in order to force from them a discovery of the royal treasures, which it was sup-posed they had concealed. Guatimozin bore whatever the refined cruelty of his tormentors could inflict, with the invincible fortitude of an American <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WARRIOR\">warrior</a>. His fellow-sufferer, overcome by the violence of the anguish, turned a dejected eye towards his master, which seemed to implore his permission to reveal all that he knew. But the high-spirited prince, darting on him a look of authority mingled with scorn, check-ed his weakness, by asking, \"Am I now reposing on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>?\" Overawed by the reproach, he per-veered in his dutiful silence, and expired. Cortes, ashamed of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> so horrid, refused the royal victim from the hands of his torturers, and prolonged a life referred for new indignities and sufferings.\n\nThe fate of the capital, as both parties had fore-seen, decided that of the empire. The provinces sub-mitted one after another to the conquerors. Small detachments of Spaniards marching through them without interruption, penetrated, in different quarters, to the great Southern ocean, which, according to the ideas of Columbus, they imagined would open a short as well as easy passage to the East Indies, and secure to the crown of Castile all the envied wealth of those fertile regions; and the active mind of Cortes began already to form schemes for attempting this important discovery. In his after-schemes, however, he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIS\">dis</a>-appointed; but Mexico hath ever since remained in the hands of the Spaniards.\n\nThe ancient kingdom of Mexico, properly so called, was divided into several provinces, of which the vale of Mexico itself was the finest in every respect. It is surrounded by verdant mountains, measuring upwards of 120 miles in circumference at their base. A great part of this vale is occupied by two lakes, the upper one of fresh water, but the lower one brackish, com-municating with the former by means of a canal. All the water running from the mountains is collected in this lower lake, on account of its being in the bottom of the valley; hence it was ready, when swelled by extraordinary rains, to overflow the city of Mexico, as has been already observed. This delightful region contained the three imperial cities of Mexico, Aco-lhuacan, and Tlacopan; besides 40 others, with innu-merable villages and hamlets; but the most consider-able of these, according to Clavigero, now scarcely retain one-twentieth part of their former magnificence. The principal inland provinces to the northward were the Otomies; to the south-west the Malatzincas and Cuitlatecas; to the south the Tlahuicas and Cohu-iexas; to the south-east, after the states of Itzocan, Jauhtepac, Quauhquecollon, Atlxco, Tehuacan, and others, were the great provinces of the Mixtecas, the Zapotecas, and the Chiapanecas; towards the east were the provinces of Tepayacac, the Popolocas, and Totonacas. The maritime provinces on the Mexican gulf were Coatzacualco and Cuatlachtlan, called by the Spaniards Cotulla. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PACIFIC_OCEAN\">Pacific ocean</a> were those of Coliman, Zacatollan, Tototepec, Tecuantepetl, and Zoconochco.\n\nThe province of the Otomies began in the northern part of the vale of Mexico, extending through the mountains to the north to the distance of 90 miles from the city of Mexico; the principal cities being Tollan or Tula, and Xilotepec; the latter made the capital of the country by the Spaniards. Beyond the settlements of the Otomies, the country for more than a thousand miles in extent was inhabited only by barbarous and wandering savages.\n\nThe Malatzincas province contained the valley of Tolocan, and all the country from Taximaroa to the frontier of the kingdom of Michuacan. The valley of Tolocan is upwards of 40 miles long from south-east to north-west, and 30 in breadth where broadest. Its principal city, named also Tolocan, is situated at the foot of a high mountain covered with snow, 30 miles distant from Mexico.\n\nThe country of the Cuitlatecas extended from north-east to south-west, upwards of 200 miles, extending as far as the Pacific ocean. Their capital was named Mexcaltepec, once a great and populous city, situated upon the sea-coast; but of which the ruins are now scarcely visible. That of the Tlahuicas was named Quauhnahuac, and situated about 40 miles to the south-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARD\">ward</a> of Mexico. The province extended almost 60 miles southward, commencing from the southern moun-tains of the vale of Mexico.\n\nThe country of the Cohuixcas extended on the southward as far as the Pacific ocean, through that part where at present the port and city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACAPULCO\">Acapulco</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a>. It was divided into the states of Tzompango, Chilapan, Tlapan, and Tititla; the latter a very hot and unwholesome country. To this province belonged a place named Tlacheo, celebrated for its silver mines.\n\nThe province of the Mixtecas extended from Acat-lan, a place distant about 120 miles from Mexico, as far as the Pacific ocean towards the south-east. The inhabitants carried on a considerable commerce, and had several well-inhabited cities and villages. To the east of the Mixtecas were the Zapotecas, so called from their capital Teetzapotlan. In their district was the valley of Huaxyacac, now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OAXACA\">Oaxaca</a> or Guaxaca.\n\nThe province of Mazatlan lay to the northward of the Mixtecas; and to the northward and eastward of the Zapotecas was Glimantla, having their capitals of the same name with their provinces. The Chiapanecas, Zoqui, and Queleni, were the last of the Mexican provinces towards the south-east. On the side of the mountain Popocatepec and around it lay several states,\nof which the most considerable were Cholallan and Huexotzinco. These two having, with the assistance of the Tlascalans, shaken off the Mexican yoke, re-established their former aristocratical government. The Cholulans possessed a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAMLET\">hamlet</a> called Cuitlaxcoapan, in the place where the Spaniards afterwards founded the city of Angelopolis, which is the second of New Spain.\n\nTo the eastward of Cholula lay a considerable state named Tepeyacac; and beyond that the Popolocas, whose principal cities were Tecamachalco and Quetzolac. To the southward of the Popolocas was the state of Tahuacan, bordering upon the country of the Mixtecas; to the east, the maritime province of Cuetlachtlan; and to the north the Totonacas. The extent of this province was 150 miles, beginning from the frontier of Zacatlan, a state distant about 80 miles from the coast, and terminating in the gulf of Mexico. Besides the capital, named Mizquihuacan, this country had the beautiful city of Chempoallan, situated on the coast of the gulf; remarkable for being that by which the Spaniards entered the Mexican empire.\n\nColima was the most northerly of the provinces on the Pacific ocean; the capital, named also Coliman, being in lat. 19\u00b0 long. 92\u00b0 W. Towards the south-east was the province of Zacotlan, with its capital of the same name; then came the coast of the Cuitlatecas; after it that of the Cohuixcanes, in which was the celebrated port of Acapulco. The Yopil bordered on the Cohuixca coast; and adjoining to that the Mixteca country, now called Xicayan; next to that was the large province of Tecuatepec; and lastly, that of Xococonochco.\n\nThis province, the most southerly of the Mexican empire, was bounded on the east and south-east by the country of Xochitepec, which did not belong to Mexico; on the west by Tecuatepec; and on the south by the ocean. The capital, called also Xococonochco, was situated between two rivers, in 14 degrees of latitude and 103\u00b0 W. longitude. On the Mexican gulf there were, besides the country of the Totonecas, the provinces of Cuetlachtlan and Coatzacualco; the latter bounded on the east by the states of Tabasco and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a> of Yucatan. The province of Cuetlachtlan comprehended all the coast between the rivers Alvarado and Antigua, where the province of the Totonecas began.\n\nThe climate of this vast country varies very much according to the situation of its different parts. The maritime places are hot, unhealthy, and moist. The lands which lie in the neighbourhood of high mountains, the tops of which are always covered with snow, must of necessity be cold; and Clavigero informs us, that he has been on a mountain not more than 25 miles distant from the city of Mexico, where there was white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FROST\">frost</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a> even in the dog-days.\n\n\"All the other inland countries (says our author), where the greatest population prevailed, enjoy a climate so mild and benign, that they neither feel the rigour of winter nor the heats of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>. It is true, in many of these countries, there is frequently white frost in the three months of December, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a>, and February, and sometimes even it snows; but the small inconvenience which such cold occasions continues only till the rising sun: no other fire than his rays is necessary to give warmth in winter; no other relief is wanted in the season of heat but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>: the same clothing which covers men in the dog-days defends them in January, and the animals <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> all the year under the open sky.\"\n\n\"This mildness and agreeableness of climate under the influence of the torrid zone is the effect of several natural causes entirely unknown to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, who did not believe it to be inhabited; and not well understood by some moderns, by whom it is believed unfavourable to those who live in it. The purity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, the smaller obliquity of the solar rays, and the longer stay of this luminary above the horizon in winter, in comparison of other regions farther removed from the equator, concur to lessen the cold, and to prevent all that horror which disfigures the face of nature in other climes. During that season a serene sky and the natural delights of the country are enjoyed; whereas, under the frigid, and even for the most part under the temperate zones, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a> rob man of the prospect of heaven, and the snow buries the beautiful productions of the earth. No less causes combine to temper the heat of summer. The plentiful showers which frequently water the earth after mid-day from April or May to September or October; the high mountains, continually loaded with snow, scattered here and there through the country of Anahuac; the cool winds which breathe from them in that season; and the shorter stay of the sun above the horizon, compared with the circumstances of the temperate zone, transform the climates of those happy countries into a cool and cheerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>. But the agreeableness of the climate is counterbalanced by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a> storms, which are frequent in summer, particularly in the neighbourhood of the mountain of Tlascala; and by earthquakes, which are at all times felt, though with less danger than terror. Storms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIL\">hail</a> are neither more frequent nor more severe than in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>.\"\n\nOne undoubted inconvenience which Mexico has is that of volcanoes. One named by the Spaniards Vulcan, can d'Orizaba is higher than the peak of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TENERIFFE\">Teneriffe</a>, according to the Jesuit Tallandier, who measured them both. It began to send forth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> in the year 1545, and continued burning for 20 years, but has not discovered any symptoms of eruption since that time. It is of a conical figure; and may be seen at 50 leagues distance. The top is always covered with snow, but the lower part with woods of pine and other valuable timber. It is about 90 miles to the eastward of the capital.\n\nTwo other mountains, named Popocatepec and Ixtaccihuatl, which lie near each other, at the distance of 33 miles to the south-east of Mexico, are likewise surprisingly high. Clavigero supposes the former to be higher than the highest of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALPS\">Alps</a>, considering the elevated ground on which the base of it stands. It has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRATER\">crater</a> more than half a mile wide; from which, in the time of the Mexican kings, great quantities of smoke and flame issued. In the 17th century it frequently threw out great showers of ashes upon the adjacent places; but in the 18th century hardly any smoke has been observed. This mountain is named by the Spaniards Vulcan, and the other Sierra Nevada. The latter has also sometimes emitted flames.\nMexico. Both of them have their tops always covered with snow in such quantities, that the masses which fall down upon the neighbouring rocks supply the cities of Mexico, Gelopoli, Cholula, and all the adjacent country to the distance of 40 miles, with that commodity; of which the consumption is so great, that in 1746 the impost upon what was consumed in the city of Mexico amounted to 15,222 Mexican crowns; some years after it amounted to 20,000; and is now in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> a great deal more.\n\nBesides these volcanoes, there are others in Mexico of a very remarkable height. The great chain of mountains called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANDES\">Andes</a> is continued through the isthmus of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PANAMA\">Panama</a> and through all Mexico, until they are lost in the unknown mountains of the north. The most considerable of that chain is known in Mexico by the name of Sierra Madre, particularly in Cincoa and Tarahumara, provinces no less than 1200 miles distant from the capital.\n\nMexico is well watered by very considerable rivers, though none of them are comparable to those of South America. Some of these run into the gulf of Mexico, and others into the Pacific ocean. The Alvarado has its principal source among the mountains of the Zapotecas, and discharges itself by three navigable mouths into the Mexican gulf, at the distance of 30 miles from Vera Cruz. The most celebrated of the rivers which run into the Pacific ocean is that called by the Spaniards Guadalaxara or Great River. It rises in the mountains of Tolocan; and after running a course of more than 600 miles, discharges itself into the ocean in 22\u00b0 latitude.\n\nThere are likewise in this country several lakes of very considerable magnitude; but those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NICARAGUA\">Nicaragua</a>, Chapallan, and Pazquaro, which are of the greatest extent, did not belong to the ancient Mexican empire. The most remarkable were those in the vale of Mexico, upon which the capital of the empire was founded. Of these, the fresh water one, called the lake of Chalco, extended in length from east to west 12 miles, as far as the city of Xochimilco; from thence, taking a northerly direction, it incorporated itself by means of a canal with the lake of Tezcuco; but its breadth did not exceed six miles. The other, named the lake of Texcoco, extended 15, or rather 17 miles from east to west, and something more from south to north; but its extent is now much less, by reason of the Spaniards having diverted the course of many of the streams which run into it. This lake is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>, which Clavigero supposes to arise from the nature of the soil which forms its bed.\n\nBesides these, there are a number of smaller lakes, some of which are very delightful. There is a vast variety of mineral waters, of the nitrous, sulphureous, and aluminous kinds, some of them so hot that meat may be boiled in them. At Tetihuacan is a kind of petrifying water, as well as in several other parts of the empire. One of them forms a kind of smooth white stones, not displeasing to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>; the scrapings of which taken in broth are celebrated as a diaphoretic, probably without any good reason. The dose for a person not difficult to be sweated is one dram of the scrapings. Many of the rivers of Mexico afford surprising and beautiful cascades; particularly the great river Guadalaxara, at a place called Tempizque, 15 miles to the southward of that city. Along a deep river called Atoyaque is a natural bridge, consisting of a vast mound of earth, along which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a> pass conveniently. Clavigero supposes it to have been the fragment of a mountain thrown down by an earthquake, and then penetrated by the river.\n\nThe mineral productions of Mexico are extremely valuable, such as gold and silver in abundance, two productions species of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, tin, lead, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a>, sulphur, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a>, vitriol, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBER\">amber</a>, and asphaltum. It also produces diamonds, amethysts, cats-eyes, cornelians, and some green stones resembling emeralds, as also quarries of jasper and marble of various colours. There are said to be whole mountains of loadstone, and a fine white talc which may be burnt into an excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTER\">plaster</a>.\n\nThe soil is capable of producing all the necessaries, and even the luxuries of human life. Historians mention no fewer than 1200 plants which are all indigenous, or natives of the country; but as these are said to be chiefly medicinal, we must conclude that provident nature has furnished them with many more which are intended for nourishment.\n\nThis country abounds with a great variety of flowers, numbers of which are peculiar to itself, while many exotics even rival them in luxuriance, such as imported from Europe. Water-melons, apples, pears, peaches, apricots, figs, &c., are among the exotics, which thrive in a manner equal to any of the indigenous productions. All the maritime countries abound with cocoa-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a> trees, of which Hernandez mentions four kinds, the smallest of which is mostly used for chocolate and other drinks.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">Prior</a> to the introduction of corn from Europe, maize was the principal grain of Mexico, and of which there were several species. It was brought from America to Spain, and from thence to the other countries of Europe. The principal kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a> used by the people was the French bean, the different species of which exceeded in number those of the maize; and one of them in particular not only supported the poorer classes, but even the Spanish nobility deemed it a luxury. Historians enumerate five species of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESCULENT\">esculent</a> roots, exclusive of many culinary vegetables imported from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CANARIES\">Canaries</a>, Spain, and other European countries. This country produces a variety of palm trees, from the fibres of the leaves of one species of which the Mexicans manufacture thread. The timber trees are numerous, and, in respect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, said to be inferior to none in the world. There are whole woods of cedars and ebonies, and some trees mentioned by Clavigero are of a most stupendous magnitude. This author mentions one that measured 107 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> feet in height; and Acosta speaks of one that was 16 fathoms in circumference. A remarkable fir tree hollowed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a>, contained within it 100 young men, according to the testimony of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOLEDO\">Toledo</a>, who went to view it in the year 1770.\n\nThis country abounds also with aromatic and medicinal trees, producing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUMS\">gums</a>, resins, &c. From one and another of these a balsam is produced not in the least inferior to the celebrated balsam of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECCA\">Mecca</a>. It is of a reddish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> or yellowish white, of a sharp bitter taste, and of a strong but most grateful odour. It is common in the provinces of Panuco and Chiapan, and other warm countries.\nThe tree producing liquid amber, the liquid florax of the Mexicans, is of a large size, the leaves similar to those of the maple, indented, white in one part and dark in the other, disposed in three; the fruit is thorny and round, but polygonous, with the surface and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>; the bark of the tree partly green and partly tawny. By incisions in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> they extract that valuable substance named liquid amber, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> of the same name, which is still more valuable. Liquid amber is likewise obtained from a decoction of the branches, but it is inferior to that obtained from the trunk.\n\nThe name copalli in Mexico is generic, and common to all the resins; but especially signifies those made use of for incense. There are ten species of these trees yielding resins of this kind; the principal of which is that from which the coral is got, so well known in medicine and varnishes. A great quantity of this was made use of by the ancient Mexicans, and is still used for similar purposes by the Spaniards. The teocalli or tepocalli is a resin similar to the incense of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a>; which distils from a tree of moderate size that grows in the mountains, having a fruit like an acorn, and containing the nut enveloped in a mucilage, within which there is a small kernel useful in medicine.\n\nThe mezquite, or mezquite, is a species of true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-ACACIA\">acacia</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUM\">gum</a> distilling from it is said to be the true gum arabic. It is a thorny shrub, with branches irregularly disposed, the leaves small, thin, and pinnate; the flowers being like those of the birch-tree. Of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> gum, which is found in plenty in Mexico, the natives were in use to make foot-balls, which, though heavy, have a better spring than those filled with air. With this they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VARNISH\">varnish</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-HATS\">hats</a>, cloaks, boots, and great coats, in a manner similar to what is done in Europe with wax; and by which means they are rendered all water proof.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a> found in Mexico at the arrival of the Spaniards, were lions, tygers, wild cats, bears, wolves, foxes, the common flags, white flags, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUCKS\">bucks</a>, wild goats, badgers, polecats, weasels, martins, squirrels, polatucos, rabbits, hares, otters, and rats. All these animals are supposed to be common to both continents. The white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAG\">flag</a>, whether it be the same species of the other or not, is undoubtedly common to both, and was known to the Greeks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>. The Mexicans call it the king of the flags. M. Buffon imagines the white colour of this creature to be the effect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTIVITY\">captivity</a>; but Clavigero says, that it is found wild, and of the same white colour, on the mountains of New Spain. In many other points, he also contests the opinions of this celebrated naturalist, who will not allow the lion, tyger, or rabbit, to be natives of America.\n\nClavigero enumerates the quadrupeds common to New Spain with the rest of the continent of America. Among these he will not allow a place to the Peruvian sheep, the llanaco, and sloth; all of which are peculiar to South America. Hernandez indeed makes mention of the Peruvian sheep, and gives a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> of it; but this was only on account of a few individuals brought thence from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERU\">Peru</a>, which the Mexicans called by that name, in the same manner as he describes several animals of the Philippine isles; not that they had ever been bred in Mexico, or found in any country of North America, unless it was some individual carried there, as they are carried as a curiosity from Europe. The animals which he allows to be common to both countries are, the Mexican <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOG\">hog</a>, the mousette, the opossum, the armadillo, the teochichi, a small animal resembling a dog; which being perfectly dumb, gave occasion to a report that the Mexican dogs could not bark. The flesh of this animal was eaten by them, and was esteemed agreeable and nourishing food. After the conquest of Mexico, the Spaniards having neither large cattle nor sheep, provided their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a> with this quadruped; by which means, the species soon came to be extinct, though it had been very numerous. The land-squirrel is very numerous in the kingdom of Michuacan, has great elegance of form, and is extremely graceful in its movements; but it cannot be tamed, and bites most furiously every person who approaches it.\n\nBesides these, there are sea lions, rats, and that voracious animal named the tapir. Oviedo informs us, that he has seen it at one bite tear off two or three hand-breadths of skin from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HOUND\">hound</a>, and at another a whole leg and thigh. The flesh is eatable, and its skin is valued on account of its being sufficiently strong to resist musket-balls. There are likewise great numbers of monkeys of many different kinds; some of which have heads resembling those of dogs. Some of them are strong and fierce, equalling a man in stature when they stand upright.\n\nAmong the animals peculiar to Mexico, is one named coyote, which appears to have been inaccurately described by natural historians; some making it one species and some another. It is about the size of a maitiff, but more slender. The eyes are yellow and sparkling, ears small, pointed, and erect; the snout blackish, strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>, and the feet armed with large crooked nails. The tail is thick and hairy, the skin a mixture of black, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>, and white; and the voice is compounded of the howl of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WOLF\">wolf</a> and the bark of the dog. It pursues the deer, and will sometimes even attack men. Its usual pace is a trot, but so quick that a horse at the gallop can scarcely overtake it. The talcojol or talcoyoto is about the size of a middling dog, and the largest animal that lives under the earth. Its head has some resemblance to that of a cat; but in colour and length of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> it resembles the lion.\u2014It has a long thick tail, and feeds upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POULTRY\">poultry</a> and small animals, which it catches in the night-time. The tepexuintli, or mountain-dog, though it is but of the size of a small dog, is so bold that it attacks deer, and sometimes kills them. Its hair and tail are long, the body black, but the head, neck, and breast, white. M. Buffon reckons this animal, the same with the glutton, but Clavigero denies it. Another animal, larger than the two foregoing, is called the xoloitzcuintli. Some of these are no less than four feet in length. It has a face like the dog, but tufts like the wolf, with erect ears, the neck grofs, and the tail long.\u2014It is entirely destitute of hair, excepting only the snout, where there are some thick crooked bristles. The whole body is covered with a smooth, soft, alabaster-coloured skin, spotted partly with black and tawny. These species of animals, as well as the two former, are almost totally extinct. A Lyncean academician named\nThere are great numbers of birds valuable on account of their plumage, which was made use of by the Mexicans in their excellent mosaic works; an art which seems now to be totally lost. Peacocks have been carried from the old continent to Mexico; but, not being attended to, have propagated very slowly. The birds remarkable for their song are likewise very numerous; among which that called the centonil, by Europeans the mocking-bird, is the most remarkable, on account of its counterfeiting naturally the notes of all others it hears. There are great numbers of beautiful parrots; and there is a bird which counterfeits the human voice, but in a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURLESQUE\">burlesque</a> tone, and will follow travellers a great way. The izacua is remarkable for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTINCT\">instinct</a>. Birds of this kind live in society, every tree being a village or city to them, having great numbers of nests in the neighbourhood of each other, all hanging from the boughs. One of them, whose office it is to be the head or guard of the village, resides in the middle of the tree; from which it flies about from one nest to another, visiting them all, and after singing a little, returns to its place, while the rest continue perfectly silent. If any bird of a different species approaches the tree, he flies to it, and with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BILL\">bill</a> and wings endeavours to drive it off; but if a man or any large animal comes near, he flies screaming to another tree; and if at that time any of his fellows happen to be returning to their nests, he meets them, and, changing his note, obliges them to retire again; as soon as he perceives the danger over, he returns to his wonted round of visiting the nests.\n\nMexico, like all other American countries, abounds with reptiles, many of them of enormous size. The crocodiles are not least to be dreaded than those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a> or Asia, and there are likewise some of those monstrous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENTS\">serpents</a> met with in the East Indies and in South America; though happily the species of those terrible creatures seems to be nearly extinct, as they are seldom to be found but in some solitary wood, or other remote place. There are great numbers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIZARDS\">lizards</a>, some of which the people suppose to be poisonous; but Clavigero thinks this opinion ill founded. There are several kinds of poisonous serpents, of which the rattlesnake is one.\n\nThe aquatic animals are innumerable. Clavigero mentions a species of frogs so large that a single one animals will weigh a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a>, and which are excellent food. Of fish proper for food, he says that he has counted upwards of 100 species, without taking in the turtle, crab, lobster, or any other crustaceous animal. The sharks are well known for their voracity. A whole sheep's skin, and even a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTCHER\">butcher</a>'s knife, has been found in the belly of one of them. They are accustomed to follow vessels, to devour any filth that is thrown overboard; and, according to Oviedo, they have been known to keep up with ships sailing before a fair wind for no less than 500 miles. The bottetto is a fish about eight inches in length, but excessively thick. While this fish lies alive upon the beach, it twells whenever it is touched to an enormous size, and boys often take pleasure in making it burst with a kick. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a> is so poisonous as to kill with strong convulsions in half an hour after it is eaten.\n\nOf flying and other minute insects, the number is prodigiously great. There are a variety of beetles;\nMexico some of a green colour make a great noise in flying; on which account children are fond of them. There are great numbers of shining beetles, which make a delightful appearance at night, as well as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> flies which abound in the country. There are six kinds of bees and four kinds of wasps; of which last, one collects wax and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a> of a very sweet taste; another is called the wandering wasp from its frequent change of abode; and in consequence of these changes, it is constantly employed in collecting materials for its habitations. The lake of Mexico abounds with a kind of fly, the eggs of which are deposited upon the flags and rushes in such quantities as to form large masses. These are collected by the fishermen, and carried to market for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>. They are eaten by both Mexicans and Spaniards, and have much the same taste as the caviare of fish. There are abundance of gnats in the moist places and lakes; but the capital, though situated upon a lake, is entirely free from them. The butterflies are in vast numbers, and their wings glow with colours far superior to those of Europe; the figures of some of them are given by Hernandez. But notwithstanding its beauties and advantages, Mexico is subject to the dreadful devastations of locusts, which sometimes occasion the most destructive famines.\n\nThere are some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a> of Mexico made use of by the inhabitants as food; others are poisonous. There are great numbers of scolopendrae and scorpions, some of the former growing to an immense size. Hernandez says, that he has seen some of them two feet long and two inches thick. The scorpions are very numerous; and in the hot parts of the country their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> is so strong as to kill children, and give terrible pain to adults. Their sting is most dangerous during those hours of the day in which the sun is hottest. There is a mischievous kind of tick, which in the hot countries abounds among the grass. From thence it easily gets upon the clothes, and from them upon the skin. There it fixes with such force, from the particular figure of its feet, that it can scarcely be got off. At first it seems nothing but a small black speck, but in a short time enlarges to such a degree, from the blood which it sucks, that it equals the size of a bean, and then assumes a leaden colour. If it is not speedily removed, a wound is made similar to that which the nigra or chogoe makes.\n\nMexico produces <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-SILK_WORMS\">silk-worms</a>; and the manufacture of silk might be carried on to great advantage, were it not prohibited for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> reasons. Besides the common silk, there is another found in the woods, very white, soft, and strong. It grows on the trees in several maritime places, particularly in dry seasons. Unless by poor people, however, this silk is not turned to any use, partly from inattention to their interests, but \"chiefly (says our author) from the obstructions which would be thrown in the way of any one who should attempt a trade of that kind. We know from Cortes's letters to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> V. that silk used to be sold in the Mexican markets; and some pictures are still preserved, done by the ancient Mexicans upon a paper made of silk.\"\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COCHINEAL\">Cochineal</a> is one of the most valuable products of Mexico, and great care is taken to rear the insect in different parts; but the best is that which comes from the province of Mixteca. Some have reckoned that more than 2500 bags of cochineal are sent every year from Mixteca to Spain; and the trade in that article carried on by the city of Oaxaca is computed at 200,000 crowns value.\n\nThough Mexico was originally inhabited by a general number of different nations, yet all of them resembled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> each other pretty much, not only in character, but in of the inhabitants' <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> appearance. \"They generally rather exceed (says Clavigero) than fall under the middle size, and are well proportioned in all their limbs. They have good complexions, narrow foreheads, black eyes, clean, firm, white, and regular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>; thick, black, coarse, glossy hair; thin beards, and generally no hair upon their legs, thighs, and arms, their skin being of an olive colour. There is scarcely a nation nor earth in which there are fewer persons deformed; and it would be more difficult to find a single hump-backed, lame, or squint-eyed man among a thousand Mexicans, than among a hundred of any other nation. The unpleasances of their colour, the thinness of their foreheads, the thinness of their beards, and the coarseness of their hair, are so far compensated by the regularity and fine proportion of their limbs, that they can neither be called very beautiful nor the contrary, but seem to hold a middle place between the extremes. Their appearance neither engages nor disgusts; but among the young women of Mexico, there are many very beautiful and fair, whose beauty is at the same time rendered more winning by the natural sweetness of their manner of speaking, and by the pleasantness and natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a> of their whole behaviour. They become gray-headed and bald earlier than the Spaniards; and although most of them die of acute diseases, it is not very uncommon among them to attain the age of a hundred. They are now, and ever have been, moderate in eating, but their passion for strong liquors is carried to the greatest excess. Formerly they were kept within bounds by the severity of the laws; but now that these liquors are become so common, and drunkenshess is unpunished, one half of the people seem to have lost their senses; and this, together with the poor manner in which they live, exposed to all the baneful impressions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, and destitute of the means of correcting them, is undoubtedly the principal cause of the havoc which is made among them by epidemical disorders.\n\n\"Many persons allow the Mexicans to possess a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> of imitation, but deny them that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>; a vulgar error, which is contradicted by the ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of that people. Their minds are affected by the same variety of passions with those of other nations, but not to an equal degree. The Mexicans seldom exhibit those transports of anger, or frenzies of love, which are so common in other countries. They are slow in their motions; and show a wonderful tenacity and steadfastness in those works which require time and long-continued attention. They are most patient of injury and hardship; and where they suspect no evil intention, are most grateful for any kindness shown: but some Spaniards, who cannot disflinguish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a> from insensibility, nor distrust from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INGRATITUDE\">ingratitude</a>, say proverbially, that the Indians are alike inflexible.\"\nMexico, insensible to injuries or benefits. That habitual distrust which they entertain of all who are not of their nation, prompts them often to lie and betray; so that good faith certainly has not been respected among them so much as it deserves. They are by nature taciturn, serious, and austere; and show more anxiety to punish crimes than to reward virtues.\n\n\"Generosity and perfect disinterestedness are the principal features of their character. Gold with the Mexicans has not that value which it enjoys elsewhere. They seem to give without reluctance what has cost them the utmost labour to acquire. The neglect of selfish interests, with the dislike which they bear to their rulers, and consequently their aversion to perform the tasks imposed by them, seem to have been the only grounds of that much exaggerated indolence with which the Americans have been charged; and, after all, there is no set of people in that country who labour more, or whose labour is more necessary. The respect paid by the young people to the old, and by children to their parents, seem to be feelings that are born with them. Parents are very fond of their children; but the affection which husbands bear to their wives is certainly less than that which wives bear to their husbands; and it is very common for the men to love their neighbours' wives better than their own.\n\n\"Courage and cowardice seem alternately to affect their minds, that it is often difficult to determine whether the one or the other predominates. They meet dangers with intrepidity, when they proceed from natural causes, but are easily terrified by the stern look of a Spaniard. That stupid indifference about death and eternity, which many authors have thought inherent in the character of every American, is peculiar only to those who are yet so rude and unformed as to have no idea of a future state.\"\n\nThe Toltecas, who first inhabited Mexico, were accounted much more polished than those who came after them, inasmuch that in after ages it was customary to distinguish people of ingenuity and learning by the name of Toltecas. They always lived in society, collected into cities, under the government of kings, and had regular laws. They were more addicted to the arts of peace than of war; and it was to them that the succeeding nations owed themselves indebted for their knowledge of the culture of grain, cotton, pepper, &c. They understood the art of casting gold and silver, and melting them in whatever forms they pleased, acquiring also great reputation from their skill in cutting gems of all kinds; and they were besides well versed in the sciences of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRONOLOGY\">chronology</a>.\n\nAccording to the ancient histories of these people, they observed, about a hundred years before the Christian era, how far the solar year exceeded the civil one; supplying the defect, as we do, by the addition of a day once in four years. In the year 660, while their monarchy continued in Tula, a celebrated astronomer, named Huematzin, assembled with the king's consent all the wise men of the nation; and with their assistance painted a famous book named Tzomoxtli, or \"divine book,\" in which were represented, in very plain figures, the origin of the Indians, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISPERSION\">dispersion</a> after the confusion of tongues at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BABEL\">Babel</a>, their journey in Asia, their first settlements in America, the founding of the kingdom of Tula, and their progress till that time: but these, and other accounts of their great knowledge and accuracy, favour too much of exaggeration, or perhaps invention, from both which it is impossible to clear the Spaniards when speaking of American affairs.\n\nThe Chichemecas derived their knowledge of agriculture from the Toltecas, and of consequence the Mexicans also. Being destitute of ploughs or animals of agriculture, sufficient strength to assist them in their labour, they made use of an instrument of hard copper, which they called coatl or coa, but differing in shape either from a spade or mattock. They used copper axes to cut trees, the figure of which was the same with ours; only that they put the axe into the eye of the handle, instead of putting the handle into the eye of the axe as we do. They had several other instruments of agriculture, but the forms of them are not mentioned by historians. They watered their fields by means of the rivers and small torrents which came from the mountains; raising dams to collect them, and forming canals to conduct them properly to the places which required moisture. They used enclosures of stone, as well as hedges for the fields, using for their hedges the aloe plant, which is well calculated for the purpose; and what reparations were necessary they gave in December. They dibbled their maize; a method of sowing more slow indeed than the ordinary one, but which certainly repays the trouble by a vastly larger crop, as well as by having a very considerable quantity of seed. Close to the newly tilled fields they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> erected a small tower of wood, where a man kept watch, in order to drive away the birds that came to feed upon the grain; a custom still preserved among the Spaniards.\n\nIn the cultivation of their gardens, the Mexicans were extremely skilful and magnificent; planting in them not only kitchen herbs, but fruit trees, medicinal herbs, and flowers, with great taste and regularity. Some of the royal gardens excited the admiration of the Spaniards so much, that Cortes, in a letter to Charles V., informed him that the garden at Huaxtepec was the most extensive, the most beautiful, and most delightful, that had ever been beheld. It was six miles in circumference, and watered by a beautiful river which crossed it; and there were pleasure houses erected at proper distances from one another. It was for many years preserved by the Spaniards. The plants most cultivated, next to maize, were cotton, cocoa, and aloe; which last served a great many useful purposes. See ALOE.\n\nThough they had not the advantage of the larger quadrupeds, as horses, oxen, or sheep, they bred up mules, an immense number of quadrupeds unknown in Europe. Private persons brought up the small quadrupeds already mentioned, resembling little dogs; as well as turkeys, quails, geese, ducks, and other kinds of fowl. In the houses of the great men were bred fish, deer, rabbits, and a variety of birds; and in the royal palaces, almost all the species of quadrupeds and winged animals to be found in these kingdoms were kept, as well as a great number of aquatic animals and reptiles. According to Clavigero, Montezuma II. surpassed all the kings in the world in this kind of magnificence; and\nand there never was a nation equal to the Mexicans in the care they took in taming animals.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">Painting</a> was an art in great request among the Mexicans, and one of very great use; as it was only by means of paintings that they recorded their histories. This art they derived, like others, from the Toltecas. Some of these paintings were mere images of their gods, kings, heroes, or of terrestrial objects. Others were historical, containing an account of particular events; others mythological, of which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> is preserved in the great library of the order of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOLOGNA\">Bologna</a>: others were codes of law, civil and religious; while some were chronological, astronomical, or astrological; in which were represented their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALENDAR\">calendar</a>, the position of the stars, changes of the moon, eclipses, and prognostications and variations of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>. Great numbers of these were burned by the superstitious Spaniards, who imagined that they contained some emblems of heathen worship. They had likewise geographical paintings, which served not only to show the extent and boundaries of their possessions, but likewise the situation of places, the direction of the coasts, and the course of the rivers. In his first letter to Charles V. Cortes says, that having made inquiries if there was any secure harbour for vessels on the Mexican coast, Montezuma presented him with a painting of the whole coast, from the port of Vera Cruz, at that time called Chalchiuhuacan, to the river Coatzacualco. Another author informs us also, that Cortes, in a long and difficult voyage which he made to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONDURAS\">Honduras</a>, made use of a chart presented to him by the lords of Coatzacualco, in which all the places and rivers were marked from the coast of Coatzacualco to Huejacallan.\n\nThe cloth on which paintings were done was made of the thread of the aloe or a kind of palm; or they painted on sheep's skins or upon paper. This last was made of the leaves of a certain kind of aloe, steeped like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEMP\">hemp</a>, and afterwards washed, stretched, and smoothed. They used also the bark of other trees, prepared with gum: but we are ignorant of the method they used in the manufacture. This paper is similar in thickness to the European pasteboard, but softer, smoother, and more easy for writing. In general it was made up in very long sheets, which they preserved in rolls, or folded like bed-screens. The volume of Mexican paintings, preserved in the library of Bologna, is a thick skin, ill dressed, composed of different pieces painted all over, and folded up in that manner. The beautiful colours which they employed both in their paintings and in their dyes, were obtained from wood, leaves, and the flowers of different plants, as well as from various animal substances. Their white was made from a kind of stone which burns into a fine plaster; or from a mineral, which after being made into a paste worked like clay, and formed into small balls, turns white in the fire like Spanish white. Their black was got from another mineral, which has a disagreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>, or from the foot of a kind of pine collected in small earthen vessels. They obtain blue and azure colours from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGO\">indigo</a>; but their mode of obtaining these was very different from that used by the moderns. They put the branches of the plant into hot, or rather lukewarm, water; and after having stirred them about for a sufficient time with a stick or ladle, they passed the water, when impregnated with the dye, into certain pots or cups, in which they let it remain until the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> part of the dye was deposited; after which they poured off the water. This sediment was first dried in the sun, and afterwards put between two plates before a fire until it grew hard. They had another plant which likewise afforded a blue colour, but inferior to the indigo. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">Red</a> was obtained from the seeds of the achiot or rocou, and purple from cochineal. Their yellows were ochre, and a colour extracted from the beautiful flower of a plant resembling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTEMISIA\">artemisia</a>.

Mezeray in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> surpassed all who had written the history of France before him, and was rewarded by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> with a pension of 400 livres. In 1668, he published an Abridgement of his History of France, in three volumes 4to, which was well received by the public; but as he inserted in that work the origin of most of the taxes, with very free reflections, M. Colbert complained of it, when Mezeray promised to correct what he had done in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> edition; but those corrections being only palliations, the minister caused half of his pension to be suppressed. Mezeray complained of this in very severe terms; when he obtained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other answer than the suppression of the other half. Vexed at this treatment, he resolved to write on subjects that could not expose him to such disappointments; and composed his treatise on the origin of the French, which did him much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>. He was elected perpetual secretary to the French academy; and died in 1683.

Both these grounding tools have been laid aside for many years; and a hand tool, resembling a shoemaker's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> board <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>, with a fine crenelling on the edge, was introduced by one Edial, a smith by trade, who afterwards became a mezzotinto painter.\n\nIt is very different from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> way of engraving. To perform it, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RAKE\">rake</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HATCH\">hatch</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNCH\">punch</a>, the surface of the plate all over with a knife, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> made for the purpose, first one way, then the other, across, &c. till the surface of the plate be thus entirely furrowed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> or furrows, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> and as it were contiguous to each other; so that, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> was then taken from it, it would be one uniform blot or smut. This done, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> is drawn or marked on the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a>; after which, they proceed with burnishers, scrapers, &c. to expunge and take out the dents or furrows, in all the parts where the lights of the piece are to be; and that more or less as the lights are to be stronger or fainter; leaving those parts <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> which are to represent the shadows or deepenings of the draught.\n\nAs it is much easier to scrape or burnish away parts of a dark ground corresponding with the outline of any design sketched upon it, than to form shades upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> ground by an infinite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HATCHES\">hatches</a>, strokes, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>, which must all terminate with exactness on the outline, as well as differ in their force and manner; the method of scraping, as it is called, in mezzotinto, consequently becomes much more easy and expeditious than any other method of engraving. The instruments used in this kind of engraving are cradles, scrapers, and burnishers.\n\nIn this engraving, the plate must be prepared and polished in the same manner as for other engraving; and afterwards divided equally by lines <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to each other, and traced out with very soft chalk. The distance of these lines should be about one-third of the length of the face of the cradle which is to be used, and these lines should be marked with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> letters, or strokes of the chalk. The cradle is then to be placed exactly betwixt the two first lines, and passed forwards in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>; being kept as steady as possible, and pressed upon with a moderate force. The same operation must be repeated with respect to all the other lines; till the instrument has thus passed over the whole surface of the plate.\u2014Other lines must be then drawn from the extremities of the other two sides, in the same manner; which, intersecting the first at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> with them form squares; and the same operation must be repeated with the cradle as in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of the first. New lines must then be drawn diagonally, and the cradle passed betwixt them as before; and when the first diagonal operation is performed, the lines must be crossed at right angles as the former, and the cradles passed betwixt them in the same manner.\u2014The plate having undergone the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the cradle, according to the disposition of the first order of lines, a second set must be formed, having the same distances from each other as the first. But they must be\nso placed as to divide those already made into spaces one-third less than their whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>; i.e., every one after the first on each side will take in one-third of that before it, e.g., beginning at A, of which the first third must be left out; a third of B will consequently be taken in, and so of the rest. These lines of the second order must be marked with small letters, or lesser strokes, to distinguish them from the first; and the same treatment of the plate must be pursued with respect to them as was practised for the others. When this second operation is finished, a third order of lines must be made; the first of which, e.g., in A, must omit two-thirds of it, and consequently take in two-thirds of B, &c. By these means, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> spaces will be exactly divided into equal thirds; and the cradle must be again employed betwixt these lines as before.\n\nWhen the whole of this operation is finished, it is called one turn; but in order to produce a very dark and uniform ground, the plate must undergo the repetition of all these several operations for above twenty times; beginning to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> the cradle again between the first lines, and proceeding in the same manner through all the rest. When the plate is prepared with a proper ground, the sketch must be chalked on it, by rubbing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> on the backside with chalk. It is also proper to overtrace it afterwards with black lead or Indian ink. The scraping is then performed, by paring or cutting away the grain of the ground in various degrees; so that none of it is left in the original state except in the touches of the strongest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>. The general manner of proceeding is the same as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> upon black paper. The masses of light are first begun with; and those parts which go off into light in their upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a>, but are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> below: the reflections are then entered upon; after which the plate is blackened with a printer's blacking-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> made of felt, in order to discover the effect: and then the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> is proceeded with; observing always to begin every part in the places where the strongest lights are to be.\n\nThe art of scraping mezzotintos has been applied to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> with a variety of colours, in order to produce the resemblance of paintings. The inventor of the method of doing this was J. C. Le Blon, a native of Frankfort, and pupil of Carlo Marata, between the years 1720 and 1730. It was established by the inventor on this principle, that there are three primitive colours, of which all the rest may be composed by mixing them in various proportions; that any two of these colours being mixed together, preserve their original power, and only produce a third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> such as their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> must necessarily give; but if transparent colours be mixed, and three primitive kinds compounded together, they destroy each other, and produce black, or a tendency to it, in proportion to the equality or inequality of the mixture; and that if, therefore, these three colours be laid, either separately or upon each other, by three plates, engraved correspondently on these principles to the colouring of the design, the whole variety of tints necessary may be produced. The requisites, therefore, to the execution of any design in this method of printing are as follows:\n\n1. To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of the colouring to be imitated; showing where the presence of each of the three simple colours is necessary, either in its pure state or combined with some other, to produce the effect required; and to reduce this plan to a painted sketch of each, in which not only the proper outlines, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of strength should be expressed.\n\n2. To engrave three plates according to this plan, which may print each of the colours exactly in the places where, and proportion in which, they are wanted.\n\n3. To find three transparent substances proper for printing with these three primitive colours. The manner in which M. Le Blon prepared the plates was as follows: The three plates of copper were first well fitted with respect to size and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> to each other, and grounded in the same manner as those designed for mezzotinto prints: and the exact <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> and boundary of each of the three primitive colours, conformably to the design, were sketched out on three papers, answering in dimensions to the plate. These sketches were then chalked on the plates; and all the parts of each plate that were not to convey the colour to which it was appropriated to the print, were entirely scraped away, as in forming the light of mezzotinto prints. The parts that were to convey the colours were then worked upon; and where the most light or diluted teints of the colour were to be, the grain in the ground was proportionally taken off; but where the full colour was required, it was left entire. In this regard was had, not only to the effects of the colour in its simple state, but to its combined operation, either in producing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">orange</a>-colour, green, or purple, by its admixture with one alone; and likewise to its forming brown, gray, and shades of different degrees, by its co-operation with both the others. But though the greatest part of the engraving was performed in the mezzotinto manner, yet the graver was employed occasionally for strengthening the shades, and for correcting the outline where it required great accuracy and steadiness. It was found necessary sometimes to have two separate plates for printing the same colour, in order to produce a stronger effect; but the second plate, which was used to print upon the first, was intended only to glaze and soften the colours in particular parts that might require it. With respect to the black and brown teints, which could not be so conveniently produced in a due degree by the mixture of the colours, umber and black were likewise used.\n\nWith respect to the order in which the plates are to be applied, it may be proper to observe, that the colour which is least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> should be laid on first; that which is betwixt the most and least apparent next; and that which predominates last; except where there may be occasion for two plates for the same colour, as was before mentioned; or where there is any required for adding browns and shades.\n\nM. Le Blon applied this art to portraits, and showed, by the specimens he produced, the possibility of its being brought, by farther improvements, to afford imitations of painting which might have some value. It is nevertheless much better adapted to the simpler subjects, where there are fewer intermixtures of colours; and where the accuracy of the reflections, and demi-teints, are not so essentially necessary to the truth of the design, from the greater latitude of form, and disposition of the colour, as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, anatomical figures, and some subjects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>. But perhaps plates engraved...\nMiasma graved or rather finished with the tool, particularly with respect to the outline, would be better accommodated in some of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> than those prepared only by scraping.\n\nM. Cochin remarks, at the end of an account he has given of M. le Blon's manner, that though this ingenious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a> confined his method principally to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of three colours; yet, should this invention be again taken up and cultivated, there would be more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> of success in using a greater variety; and that several different kinds might be printed by one plate, provided they were laid on in their respectively proper places by printing-balls, which should be used for that colour only. His hint might however be very greatly improved, by the further affluence of pencils, accommodated to the plates, for laying on the colours in the proper parts.\u2014For the method of taking off mezzotinto prints on glass, see Back-painting.","sp":395,"ep":397},{"h":"MIASMA","t":"among physicians, a particular kind of effluvia, by which certain fevers, particularly intermittents, are produced.","sp":397,"ep":397},{"h":"MICAH","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> The Book of Micah, a canonical book of the Old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>, written by the prophet Micah, who is the sixth of the twelve lesser prophets.

As to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a> between Michael and the Dragon, some authors understand it literally, and think it means the expulsion of certain rebellious angels, with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> or leader, from the presence of God. Others take it in a figurative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>; and refer it, either to the contest that happened at Rome between St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> and Simon Magus, in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOSTLE\">apostle</a> prevailed over the magician, or to those violent persecutions under which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> laboured for three hundred years, and which happily ceased when the powers of the world became Christian. Among the commentators who maintain the former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> is Grotius; and among those who take it in a figurative sense are Hammond and Mede.\n\nThe contest about the body of Moses is likewise taken both literally and figuratively. Those who understand it literally are of opinion, that Michael by the order of God hid the body of Moses after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>; and that the Devil endeavoured to discover it, as a fit means to entice the people to idolatry, by a superstitious worship of his relics. But this dispute is figuratively understood to be a controversy about rebuilding the temple, and restoring the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of God among the Jews at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>; the Jewish church being fitly styled the body of Moses. It is thought by some, that this story of the contest between Michael and the Devil was taken by St Jude out of an apocryphal book called The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">Assumption</a> of Moses.\n\nThe Roman church celebrates three appearances of Michael, of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> mention is made in scripture, and which have happened, they say, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of the apostles. The first appearance of this archangel was at Colossae in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHRYGIA\">Phrygia</a>, but at what time is uncertain. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> is that of Mount Garganus, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a>, about the end of the fifth century. The third is his appearance to Aubert bishop of Avranches, upon a rock called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOMB\">Tomb</a>, where at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">abbey</a> of St Michael. This was about the year 756. The first of these festivals is observed on the 6th of September, the second on the 8th of May, and the last on the 16th of October. It has been supposed, that it was Michael the archangel who conducted the Israelites in their journey through the wilderness, (see Exod. xxxii. 20, 23, and xxxiii. 2;) that it was he who appeared to Moses in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> bush; who appeared to Joshua in the fields of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERICHO\">Jericho</a>, and to Gideon and Manoah the father of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAMSON\">Samson</a>; and, in a word, to him have been imputed the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the most remarkable appearances either in the Old or New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>.\n\nMICHAEL ANGELO. See ANGELO.\n\nMount MICHAEL, formerly one of the most celebrated slate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRISONS\">prisons</a> of France, lies about 20 miles from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANVILLE\">Granville</a>. It is a rock situated in the middle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> of Avranches; and is only accessible at low <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">Nature</a> has completely fortified one side, by its craggy and almost perpendicular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a>, which renders it impracticable to mount it by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> or courage, however consummate. The other parts are surrounded by walls fenced with semilunar towers after the Gothic manner; but sufficiently strong, together with the advantage of its situation, to render it impregnable to any attack. At the foot of the mountain begins a street or town, which winds round its base to a considerable height. Above are chambers where state prisoners are kept, and where there are other buildings intended for residence. On the summit is erected the abbey itself, occupying a prodigious space of ground, and of a strength and solidity equal to its enormous size; since it has for many centuries withstood all the injuries of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>; to which it is so much exposed. In an apartment, called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">Sale</a> de Chavalerie, the knights of St Michael used to meet in solemn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVOCATION\">convocation</a> on important occasions. They were the defenders and guardians of this mountain and abbey, as those of the Temple, and of St John of Jerusalem, were of the holy sepulchre. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALL\">hall</a> in which they met is very spacious, but rude and barbarous. At one end is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> of the archangel, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> of their order; and in this hall <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XI. first instituted and invested with the insignia of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHTHOOD\">knighthood</a> the chevaliers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> of St Michael. There is a miserable dark apartment, or rather dungeon, in which many eminent persons were formerly confined. In the middle of it is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAGE\">cage</a>, composed of prodigious bars of wood; and the wicket which gives entrance into it is 10 or 12 inches in thickness. The inside of it comprises about 12 or 14 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, and it is nearly 20 in height. Towards\nwards the latter end of the 17th century, a newswriter in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, who had presumed to print some very fevered and sarcastic reflections on Madame de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAINTENON\">Maintenon</a>, was confined in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. Some months after his publication, he was induced, by a person sent expressly for that purpose, to make a tour into French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLANDERS\">Flanders</a>. The moment he had quitted the Dutch territories, he was put under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARREST\">arrest</a>; and immediately, by his majesty's express command, conducted to Mount Michael, where he was shut up in this cage. Here he lived upwards of 23 years; and here he at length expired. During the long nights of winter, no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> or fire was allowed him. He was not permitted to have any book. He <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, except the gaoler, who came once every day to present him, through a hole in the wicket, with his little portion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> and wine. No <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> was given him with which he could destroy himself; but he found means at length to draw out a nail from the wood, with which he engraved, or cut on the bars of his cage, certain fleurs de lis and armorial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARINGS\">bearings</a>, which formed his only employment and recreation. They are very curiously performed considering the rudeness of his instrument.\n\nThe subterraneous chambers in this mountain are said to be so numerous, that the gaolers themselves do not know them. There are certain dungeons called abbelettes, into which they were accustomed anciently to let <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> malefactors guilty of very heinous crimes: they provided them with a loaf of bread and a bottle of wine, and then they were totally forgotten, and left to perish by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a> in the dark vaults of the rock. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>, however, has not been inflicted by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> in the last or present century.\n\nHere also is a remarkable chamber, in one corner of which is a kind of window: between this and the wall of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> is a very deep space, of near 100 feet perpendicular, at the bottom of which is another window opening to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. It is called the Hole of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTGOMERY\">Montgomery</a>; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of it is as follows: In the year 1559, Henry II. king of France was unfortunately killed at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOURNAMENT\">tournament</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> de Montgomery*. He was a Huguenot; and having escaped the massacre of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, made head against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> forces in Normandy, supported by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a> with arms and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>. Being driven from his fortresses in these parts, he retired to a rock called the Tombelaine. This is another similar to Mount Michael; only three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> from it, and of nearly equal dimensions. At that time there was a castle upon it, which has since been demolished, and of which scarce any vestiges now remain. From this fortress, accessible only at low-water, he continually made excursions, and annoyed the enemy, who never dared to attack him. He coined money, laid all the adjacent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> under contribution, and rendered himself universally dreaded. Defeated, however, to surprise Mount Michael, he found means to engage one of the monks resident in the abbey; who promised to give him the signal for his enterprise by displaying a handkerchief. The monk having made the signal, betrayed him, and armed all his associates, who waited Montgomery's arrival. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> came, attended by 50 chosen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>, all desperate, and capable of any attempt. They crossed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>; and having placed their scaling-ladders, mounted one by one. As they came to the top, they were despatched, each in turn, without noise. Montgomery, who followed last, discovered the perfidy, and escaped with only two of his men, with whom he regained the Tombelaine. They preserve with great care the ladders and grappling irons used on this occasion. The count was at last besieged and taken prisoner, by the mar\u00e9chal de Matignon, in 1574, at Domfront, in Normandy; and Catharine de Medicis, who hated him for having been, though innocently, the cause of her husband's death, caused him to be immediately executed.\n\nThe church of Mount Michael is a great curiosity. It stands on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> pillars of most enormous dimensions, built on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> rock. Each of them appears to be about 25 feet in circumference: besides these, there are two others much inferior in size, on which the centre of the church rests, and over which is the tower. The following is the legendary account of the origin of this church: In the reign of Childbert II., there was a bishop of Avranches named St Aubert. To this holy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> the archangel Michael was pleased to appear one night, and ordered him to go to this rock to build a church. St Aubert treated this as a dream; upon which the angel appeared a second time; and being still disobeyed, he returned a third time, when, by way of imprinting his command upon the saint's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, he made a hole in his skull, by touching it with his thumb. The skull is still preserved in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a> of the church. It is enclosed in a little shrine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, and a crystal, which opens over the orifice, admits the gratification of curiosity by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of it. The hole is of a size and shape proportionable to the thumb said to have produced it; but it is impossible to determine whether it has been really made by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a> or any other way. It is not to be supposed that the saint would forget such a sensible mark of the angel's displeasure; he therefore immediately repaired to the rock, and constructed a small church, as he had been commanded. Here, however, true history supplies the place of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a>; and informs us, that it was in 966 when Richard the second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Normandy began to build the abbey. It was completed about the year 1070, under William the Conqueror, though many other additions were made by succeeding abbots.\n\nIn the treasury of the church are innumerable other relics: among which some few have a real and intrinsic value. There is a fine head of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> VI. of France, cut in a crystal, and the representation of a cockleshell in gold, weighing many pounds, given by Richard II. duke of Normandy, when he founded the abbey. There is an arm said to belong to St Richard king of England; but who this saint was it must be very difficult to determine. Such is the history of the priory, abbey, and church of Mount Michael previous to the revolution; they have probably undergone some changes since that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>.\n\nSt MICHAEL'S, a borough town of Cornwall, between St Columb and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRURO\">Truro</a>, 247 miles from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>.

After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of his father, he came to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> to reside with an uncle who was a brewer there, and who admitted him into a share of his business; not being qualified to succeed in this line, he went to London about the time of the conclusion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> which began in 1755, with a view to procure a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>. Here he was disappointed; but introduced himself to the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Lyttelton, to whom he sent one of his poems. From his Lordship, however, he received <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other favour than being admitted to several interviews, and encouraged to persevere in his poetical plans.\n\nSo closely did our author cultivate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSES\">muses</a>, that before he was 18 years of age he had written two tragedies and half an epic poem; but all these were committed to the flames. The first of his poems which appeared in print was published in one of the Edinburgh magazines, and entitled, \"On passing through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a> Cloak of Edinburgh at Midnight.\" This was afterwards inserted in A Collection of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">Original</a> Poems by a Scotch gentleman, vol. ii. p. 137.\n\nFrom the time of Mr Mickle's arrival in London till the year 1765, it is not known how he employed his time, though it is probable that he was employed in some branch of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> business; and in 1765 he engaged himself as corrector to the Clarendon press. This year he published the poem which first brought him into notice, entitled, \"Pollio, an Elegiac Ode,\" written in the Wood near R\u2014\u2014 (Rollin) Castle,\"\nThis was an elegy written on the death of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>; which, previous to its publication, had been shown to Lord Lyttelton, and received some corrections from him. The latter, in an epistle to the author, spoke of it as equal to any thing of the kind in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>. In 1767 he published a poem called \"The Concubine, in two cantos, after the manner of Spencer,\" 4to; and in 1769 he published, \"A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">Letter</a> to Mr Harwood, wherein some of his evasive gloffes, false translations, and blundering criticisms, in support of the Arian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERESY\">Heresy</a>, contained in his literal translation of the New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>, are pointed out and confuted,\" 8vo: and next year he published \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a> Queen of Scots, an Elegy;\" \"Hengist and Mary, a Ballad;\" and \"Knowledge, an Ode;\" in Peach's Collection of Poems. In 1770 he published \"Voltaire in the Shades, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Dialogues on the Deistical Controversy,\" 8vo. The Elegy on Mary had been submitted to the judgement of Lord Lyttelton, who declined to criticise it, not for its deficiency in poetical merit, but from thinking differently from the author concerning that unfortunate princess.\n\nAbout this time Mr Mickle was a frequent writer in the Whitehall Evening <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">Post</a>; but a more important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> now engaged his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. When no more than 17 years of age he had read Caffara's translation of the Lusiad of Camoens into French, and then projected the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of giving an English translation of it. From this, however, he was prevented by various avocations till the year 1771, when he published the first book as a specimen: and having prepared himself by acquiring some knowledge of the Portuguese language, he determined to apply himself entirely to this work. With this view he quitted his residence at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>, and went to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> at Forest-hill, where he pursued his design with unremitting assiduity till the year 1775, when the work was entirely finished.\n\nDuring the time that Mr Mickle was engaged in this work, he subsisted entirely by his employment as corrector of the press; and on his quitting that employment he had only the subscriptions he received for his translation to support him. Notwithstanding these difficulties, he adhered steadily to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> he had laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, and completed it in about five years.\n\nWhen his work was finished, Mr Mickle applied to a person of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, with whom his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> had been connected, for permission to dedicate it to him. Permission was granted, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> honoured him with a very polite letter; but after receiving a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a>, for which an extraordinary price was paid for the binding, he did not think proper to take any notice of the author. At last a gentleman of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> rank in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> world, a firm friend to the author, and who afterwards took him under his protection, waited on the patron, and heard him declare that he had not read the work, but that it had been represented not to have the merit it was at first said to possess. The applause with which the work was received, however, soon banished from the author's mind those disagreeable sensations which had been occasioned by the contemptuous neglect of his patron, as well as some severe criticisms which had been circulated concerning it. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> edition was prepared in 1773, with a plate prefixed to it, executed by the celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a> Mortimer; on whom Mr Mickle wrote an epitaph in 1779. This year also he published a pamphlet, entitled, \"A Candid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">Examination</a> of the Reasons for depriving the East <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a> of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTER\">Charter</a>, contained in The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> and Management of the East India Company from its Commencement to the Present Time; together with some Strictures on the Self-Contradictions and Historical Errors of Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a> Smith, in his Reasons for the Abolition of the said Company,\" 4to. About this time some of his friends thought of recommending him to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> as deserving of a pension; but this scheme was never put into execution. Dr Lowth bishop of London, would have put him into orders, and provided for him in the church; but this was not agreeable to our author's disposition. While he was meditating a publication of all his poems, in which he would most probably have found his account, he was appointed secretary to Commodore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JOHNSTONE\">Johnstone</a>, who had lately obtained the command of the Romney <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of war. In November 1779 he arrived at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LISBON\">Lisbon</a>, and was named by his patron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> for the prizes which were taken. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> and its neighbourhood he resided more than six months, being everywhere received with every mark of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITENESS\">politeness</a> and attention; and during this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> he composed his poem called \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALMADA\">Almada</a> Hill,\" which in 1781 was published in quarto. He collected also many particulars concerning the manners of the Portuguese, which he intended also to have published. During his stay at Lisbon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Academy was opened; and Mr Mickle, who was present at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> of its commencement, had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to be admitted a member under the presidency of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DON\">Don</a> John of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRAGANZA\">Braganza</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Laf\u00f5es. His presence being thought necessary in England to attend to the proceedings of the courts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> respecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDEMNATION\">condemnation</a> of some of the prizes, he did not accompany the Commodore in his last expedition, nor did he go any more to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. In 1782 he published \"The Prophecy of Queen Emma, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Ballad lately discovered, written by Johannes Turgotus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURHAM\">Durham</a>, in the reign of William Rufus; to which is added by the Editor, an Account of the Discovery, and Hints towards a Vindication of the Authenticity, of the Poems of Offian and Rowley,\" 8vo.\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> this year Mr Mickle married Miss Tomkins, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of the person with whom he resided at Forest-hill, while engaged in translating the Lusiad. Having received some fortune with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a>, as well as made some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> himself when in the service of Commodore Johnstone, he now enjoyed a comfortable independence. He afterwards fixed his residence at Wheatley in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORDSHIRE\">Oxfordshire</a>, and devoted his time to the revision of his poetical works, which he proposed to publish by subscription. During the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> he was employed in writing for the European <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a>. The Fragments of Leo, and some of the most approved reviews of books, in that periodical work, were of his production. He died after a short illness, on the 25th of October 1788, at Wheatley, leaving one son behind him. His poetry possesses much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, variety, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> of numbers, and vigour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>:","sp":399,"ep":400},{"h":"MICROCOSM","t":"a Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> signifying the little world; used by some for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, as being supposed an epitome of the universe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> great world.","sp":400,"ep":401},{"h":"MICROGRAPHY","t":"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of objects viewed with the assistance of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a>. See Microscopic objects.","sp":401,"ep":401},{"h":"MICROMETER","t":"an astronomical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>, by which small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> magnitudes of objects viewed through telescopes or microscopes are measured with great exactness.\n\n1. The first TELESCOPIC micrometers were only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> contrivances for measuring the image of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a> of the object-glass. Before these contrivances were thought of, astronomers were accustomed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> the field of view in each of their telescopes, by observing how much of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> they could see through it, the semidiameter being reckoned at 15 or 16 minutes; and other distances were estimated by the eye, comparing them with the field of view. Mr Galcogne, an English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, however, fell upon a much more accurate method before the year 1641, and had a Treatise on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">Optics</a> prepared for the press; but he was killed during the civil wars in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> I., and his manuscript was never found. His instrument, however, fell into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of Mr R. Townly*, who says, that by the help of it he could mark above 40,000 divisions in a foot.\n\n2. Mr Galcogne's instrument being shown to Dr Hooke, he gave a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of it, and proposed several improvements\u2020. Mr Galcogne divided the image of an object in the focus of the object glass, by the approach of two pieces of metal ground to a very fine edge, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of which Dr Hooke would substitute two fine hairs stretched <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to one another.\n\n3. Mr Huygens measured the apparent diameters of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a>, by first determining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of the field of view in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TELESCOPE\">telescope</a>; which, he says, is best done by observing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">star</a> takes up in passing over it, and then preparing two or three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and slender <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> plates, of various breadths, the sides of which are very straight, and converging to a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a>. In using these pieces of brass, he made them slide in two slots, made in the sides of the tube, opposite to the place of the image, and observed in what place it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> covered the diameter of any planet, or any small distance that he wanted to measure\u2021. It was observed, however, by Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton, that the diameters of planets, measured in this manner, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be larger than they should be, as all lucid objects appear to be when they are viewed upon dark ones.\n\n4. In the Ephemerides of the Marquis of Malvasia, published in 1662, it appears that he had a method of measuring small distances between fixed stars and the diameters of the planets, and also of taking accurate draughts of the spots of the moon by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a> of silver wire, fixed in the focus of the eye-glass. He likewise contrived to make one of two stars <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> along the threads of this net, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> it, or the telescope, as much as was necessary for that purpose; and he counted, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENDULUM\">pendulum</a>-clock, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEATING\">beating</a> seconds, the time that elapsed in its passage from one wire to another, which gave him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of minutes and seconds of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> contained between the intervals of the Micrometer wires of his net, with respect to the focal length of his telescope.\n\n5. In 1666, Messrs Auzout and Picard published a description of a micrometer, which was nearly the same micrometer with that of the Marquis of Malvasia, excepting the method of dividing it, which they performed with more exactness by a screw. In some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> they used threads of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>, as being finer than silver wires. Dechales also recommends a micrometer consisting of fine wires, or silk threads, the distances of which were exactly known, disposed in the form of a net, as peculiarly convenient for taking a map of the moon.\n\n6. M. de la Hire says, that there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> method more simple or commodious for observing the digits of an micrometric eclipse than a net in the focus of the telescope. These, he says, were generally made of silk threads; and that for this particular purpose six concentric circles had also been made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of, drawn upon oiled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>; but he advises to draw the circles on very thin pieces of glass with the point of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMOND\">diamond</a>. He also gives several particular directions to assist persons in the use of them.\n\n7. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">Construction</a> of Different Micrometers. The first we shall describe is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> micrometer. Let ABCD micrometer be the focus of the telescope at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> focus of the object-glass, or where the wires are situated, which are placed in a short tube containing the eye-glass, and may be turned into any position by turning that tube; m n is a fine wire extended over its centre; v w, x y, are two parallel wires well fixed, and perpendicular to m n; v w is fixed, and x y moves parallel to it by means of a screw, which carries two indexes over a graduated plate, to show the number of revolutions and parts of a revolution which it makes. Now to measure any angle, we must first ascertain the number of revolutions and parts of a revolution corresponding to some known angle, which may be thus done: 1st, Bring the inner edges of the wires exactly to coincide, and set each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">index</a> to 0; turn the screw, and separate the wires to any distance; and observe the time a star m is in passing along the wire m n from one vertical wire to the other: for that time, turned into minutes and seconds of a degree, will be the angle answering to the number of revolutions, or the angle corresponding to the distance. Thus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> d = col. of the star's declination, we have \\( \\frac{d}{m} \\) dm, the angle corresponding to this distance; and hence, by proportion, we find the angle answering to any other. 2ndly, Set up an object of a known diameter, or two objects at a given distance, and turn the screw till the vertical wires become tangents to the object, or till their opening just takes in the distance of the two objects upon the wire m n; then from the diameter, or distance of the two objects from each other, and their distance from the glass, calculate the angle, and observe the number of revolutions and parts corresponding. 3rdly, Take the diameter of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> on any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, by making the wires tangents to the opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>, and find, from the nautical almanac, his diameter on that day. Here it will be best to take the upper and lower limbs of the sun when on the meridian, as he has then no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> perpendicular to the horizon. If the edges do not coincide when the indexes stand at 0, we must allow for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>. Instead of making a proportion, it is better to have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> calculated to show the angle correspond-\ning to every revolution and parts of a revolution. But the observer must remember, that when the micrometer is fixed to telescopes of different focal lengths, a new table must be made. The whole system of wires is turned about in its own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>, by turning the eye-tube round with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and by that means the wire can be thrown into any position, and consequently angles in any position may be measured. Dr Bradley added a small motion by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACK\">rack</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PINION\">pinion</a> to set the wires more accurately in any position.\n\n8. But the micrometer, as now contrived, is of use, not only to find the angular distance of bodies in the field of view at the same time, but also of those which, when the telescope is fixed, pass through the field of view successively; by which means we can find the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> ascensions and declinations.\n\nLet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AA\">Aa</a>, Bb, Cc, be three parallel and equidistant wires, the middle one bisecting the field of view; HOR a fixed wire perpendicular to them passing through the centre of the field; and Ff, Gg, two wires parallel to it, each moveable by a micrometer screw, as before, so that they can be brought up to HOR, or a little beyond. Then to find the angular distance of two objects, bring them very near to Bb, and in a line parallel to it, by turning about the wires, and bring one upon HOR, and by the micrometer screw make Ff or Gg pass through the other; then turn the screw till that wire coincides with HOR, and the arc which the index has passed over shows their angular distance. If the objects be further remote than you can carry the distance of one of the wires Ff, Gg from HOR, then bring one object to Ff and the other to Gg; and turn each micrometer screw till they meet, and the sum of the arcs passed over by each index gives their angular distance. If the objects be two stars, and one of them be made to run along HOR, or either of the moveable wires as occasion may require, the motion of the other will be parallel to these wires, and their difference of declinations may be observed with great exactness; but in taking any other distances, the motion of the stars being oblique to them, it is not quite so easy to get them parallel to Bb; because if one star be brought near, and the eye be applied to the other to adjust the wires to it, the former star will have gotten a little away from the wire. Dr Bradley, in his account of the use of this micrometer, published by Dr Maskelyne in the Philosophical Transactions for 1772, thinks the best way is to move the eye backwards and forwards as quick as possible; but it seems to be best to fix the eye at some point between, by which means it takes in both at once sufficiently well defined to compare them with Bb. In finding the difference of declinations, if both bodies do not come into the field of view at the same time, make one run along the wire HOR, as before, and fix the telescope and wait till the other comes in, and then adjust one of the moveable wires to it, and bring it up to HOR, and the index gives the difference of their declinations. The difference of time between the passage of the star at either of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> moveable wires, and the transit of the other star over the cross fixed wire (which represents a meridian), turned into degrees and minutes, will give the difference of right ascension. The star has been here supposed to be biflected by the wire; but if the wire be a tangent to it, allowance must be made for the breadth of the wire, provided the adjustment be made for the coincidence of the wires. In observing the diameters of the sun, moon, or planets, it may perhaps be most convenient to make use of the outer edges of the wires, because they appear most distinct when quite within the limb; but if there should be any sensible inflection of the rays of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> in passing by the wires, it will be best avoided by using the inner edge of one wire and the outward edge of the other; for by that means the inflection at both limbs will be the same way, and therefore there will be no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> of the relative position of the rays passing by each wire. And it will be convenient in the micrometer to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> at what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> the index stands when the moveable wire coincides with HOR; for then you need not bring the wire when a star is upon it up to HOR, only reckon from the division at which the index then stands to the above division.\n\n9. With a micrometer thus adapted to a telescope, Mr Savery of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXETER\">Exeter</a> proposed a new way of measuring the difference between the greatest and least apparent diameters of the sun, although the whole of the sun's disk was not visible in the field of view at once. The method we shall briefly describe. Place two object-glasses instead of one, so as to form two images whose limbs shall be at a small distance from each other; or instead of two perfect lenses, he proposed to cut a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENS\">lens</a> into four parts of equal breadths by parallel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, and to place the two segments with their straight sides against each other, or the two middle frustums with their opposite edges together; in either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, the two parts which before had a common centre and axis, have now their centres and axes separated, and consequently two images will be formed as before by two perfect lenses. Another method in reflectors was to cut the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> concave reflector through the centre, and by a contrivance to turn up the outer edges whilst the straight ones remained fixed; by which means the axis of the two parts became inclined, and formed two images. Two images being formed in this manner, he proposed to measure the distance between the limbs when the diameters of the sun were the greatest and least, the difference of which would be the difference of the diameters required. Thus far we are indebted to Mr Savery for the idea of forming two images; and the admirable uses to which it was afterwards applied, we shall next proceed to describe.\n\n10. The divided object-glass micrometer, as now made, was contrived by the late Mr John Dollond, and by Mr John him adapted to the object-end of a reflecting telescope, Dollond, and has been since by the present Mr P. Dollond his son applied with equal advantage to the end of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACHROMATIC\">achromatic</a> telescope. The principle is this: The object-glass is divided into two segments in a line drawn through the centre; each segment is fixed in a separate frame of brass, which is moveable, so that the centres of the two segments may be brought together by a handle for that purpose, and thereby form one image of an object; but when separated they will form two images, lying in a line passing through the centre of each segment; and consequently the motion of each image will be parallel to that line, which can be thrown into any position by the contrivance of another handle to turn...\nturn the glass about in its own plane. The brass-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> carries a vernier to measure the distance of the centres of the two segments. Now let E, and H be the centres of the two segments, F their principal focus, and PQ two distant objects in FE, FH, produced, or the opposite limbs of the same object PBQD; then the images of P and Q, formed by each segment, or the images of the opposite limbs of the object PBQD, coincide at F: hence two images m = F, n = F of that object are formed, whose limbs are in contact; therefore the angular distance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> P and Q is the same as the angle which the distance EH subtends at F, which, as the angles supposed to be measured are very small, will vary as EH extremely nearly; and consequently if the angle corresponding to one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of the centres of the segments be known, the angle corresponding to any other will be found by proportion. Now to find the interval for some one angle, take the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> diameter of the sun on any day, by separating the images till the contrary limbs coincide, and read off by the vernier the interval of their centres, and look into the nautical almanac for the diameter of the sun on that day, and you have the corresponding angle. Or if greater exactness be required than from taking the angle in proportion to the distances of their centres, we may proceed thus:\u2014Draw FG perpendicular to EH, which therefore bisects it; then one half EH, or EG, is the tangent of half the angle EFH; hence, half the distance of their centres is to the tangent of half the angle corresponding to that distance as half any other distance of the centres is to the tangent of half the corresponding angle (A).\n\n11. From this the method of measuring small angles is manifest; for we consider P, Q either as two objects whose images are brought together by separating the two segments, or as the opposite limbs of one object PBQA, whose images, formed by the two segments E, H, touch at F; in the former case, EH gives the angular distance of the two objects; and in the latter, it gives the angle under which the diameter of the object appears. In order to find the angular distance of two objects, therefore, separate the segments till the two images which approach each other coincide; and to find the diameter of an object, separate the segments till the contrary limbs of the images touch each other, and read off the distance of the centres of the segment from the vernier (B), and find the angle as directed in the last article. Hence appears Micrometer's one great superiority in this above the wire micrometer; as, with the one any diameter of an object may be measured with the same ease and accuracy; whereas with the other we cannot with accuracy measure any diameter, except that which is at right angles to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of motion.\n\n12. But, besides these two uses to which the instrument seems so well adapted, Dr Malkeleyne* has shown, how it may be applied to find the difference of right ascensions and declinations. For this purpose, two wires at right angles to each other, bifurcating the field of view, must be placed in the principal focus of the eye-glass, and moveable about in their own plane.\u2014Let HCR be the field of view, HR and Cc the two wires; turn the wires till the westernmost star (which is the best, having further to move) run along ROH; Fig. 4, then separate the two segments, and turn about the micrometer till the two images of the same star <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> in the wire Cc; and then, partly by separating the segments, and partly by raising or depressing the telescope, bring the two innermost images of the two stars to appear and run along ROH, as a, b, and the vernier will give the difference of their declinations; because, as the two images of one of the stars coincided with Cc, the image of each star was brought perpendicularly upon HR, or to HR in their proper meridian. And, for the same reason, the difference of their times of passing the wire COc will give their difference of right ascensions. These operations will be facilitated, if the telescope be mounted on a polar axis.* If two other wires KL, MN, parallel to Cc, be placed near H and R, the observation may be made on two stars whose difference of meridians is nearly equal to HR the diameter of the field of view, by bringing the two images of one of the stars to coincide with one of these wires. If two stars be observed whose difference of declinations is well settled, the scale of the micrometer will be known.\n\n13. It has hitherto been supposed, that the images of the two stars can be both brought into the field of view at once upon the wire HOR; but if they cannot, let the micrometer to the difference of their declinations as nearly as you can, and make the image which comes first run along the wire HOR, by elevating or depressing the telescope; and when the other star comes in, if it do not also run along HOR, alter\n\n---\n\n(A) If the object is not distant let f be the principal focus; then Ff : FG :: FG : FK (FG being produced to meet a line joining the apparent places of the two objects P, Q,), \u2234 dividendo, fG : FG :: GK : FK, and alternando, fG : GK :: FG : FK :: (by similar triangles) EH : PQ, hence EH = PQ, therefore the angle subtended by EH at f = the angle subtended by PQ at G; and consequently, as fG is constant, the angle measured at G is, in this case, also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to EH. The instrument is not adapted to measure the angular distance of bodies, one of which is near and the other at a distance, because their images would not be formed together.\n\n(B) To determine if there be any error in the adjustment of the micrometer scale, measure the diameter of any small well-defined object, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a>'s equatorial diameter, or the longest axis of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATURN\">Saturn</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a>, both ways, that is, with o on the vernier to the right and left of o on the scale, and half the difference is the error required. This error must be added to or subtracted from all observations, according as the diameter measured with o on the vernier, when advanced on the scale, is less or greater than the diameter measured the other way. And it is also evident, that half the sum of the diameters thus measured gives the true diameter of the object.\nthe micrometer till it does, and half the sum of the numbers shown by the micrometer at the two separate observations of the two flares on the wire HOR will be the difference of their declinations. That this should be true, it is manifestly necessary that the two segments should recede equally in opposite directions; and this is effected by Mr Dollond in his new improvement of the object-glass micrometer.\n\n14. The difference of right ascensions and declinations of Venus or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">Mercury</a> in the sun's disk and the sun's limb may be thus found. Turn the wires so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> limb n of the sun's image <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">AB</a>, or the north limb of the image V of the planet, may run along the wire RH, which therefore will then be parallel to the equator, and consequently Cc a secondary to it; then separate the segments, and turn about the micrometer till the two images Vv of the planet pass Cc at the same time, and then by separating the segments, bring the north limb of the northernmost image V of the planet to touch HR, at the time the northernmost limb n of the southernmost image AB of the sun touches it, and the micrometer shows the difference of declinations of the northernmost limbs of the planet and sun, for the reason formerly given (Art. 11.) having brought the northernmost limbs of the two innermost images V and AB to HR, these two being manifestly interior to v and the northernmost limb N of the image PQ. In the same manner we take the difference of declinations of their southernmost limbs; and half the difference of the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> (taking immediately one after another) is equal to the difference of the declinations of their centres, without any regard to the sun's or planet's diameters, or error of adjustment of the micrometer; for as it affects both equally, the difference is the same as if there were no error; and the difference of the times of the transits of the eastern or western limbs of the sun and planet over Cc gives the difference of their right ascensions.\n\n15. Instead of the difference of right ascensions, the distance of the planet from the sun's limb, in lines parallel to the equator, may be more accurately observed thus: Separate the segments, and turn about the wires and micrometer, so as to make both images V, v, run along HR, or so that the two intersections I, T of the sun's image may pass Cc at the same time. Then bring the planet's and sun's limbs into contact, as at V, and do the same for the other limb of the sun, and half the difference gives the distance of the centre of the planet from the middle of the chord on the sun's disk parallel to the equator, or the difference of the right ascensions of their centres, allowing for the motion of the planet in the interval of the observations, without any regard to the error of adjustment, for the same reason as before. For if you take any point in the chord of a circle, half the\n\n(c) For if the eye can see distinctly an image at F, the pencils of rays, of which PF, QF are the two axes, diverging from F, are each brought to a focus on the retina at the same point; and therefore the two limbs appear to coincide: but if we increase the refractive power of the eye, then each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> is brought to a focus, and they cross each other before the rays come to the retina, consequently the two limbs on the retina will lap over; and if we diminish the refractive power of the eye, then each pencil being brought to a focus beyond the retina, and not crossing till after they have passed it, the two limbs on the retina must be separated.\nMicrometer R by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRISM\">prism</a> PR, may proceed in the direction RQ; and as all the rays which were proceeding to a suffer the same refraction at the prism, they will all be refracted to Q; and therefore, instead of an image ab, which would have been formed by the lens alone, an image Oc is formed by those rays which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> on the prism PR; and for the same reason, the rays falling on the prism SR will form an image Qd: and in fig. 9, the image of the point b is brought to Q, by the prism PR, and consequently an image Qd is formed by those rays which fall on PR: and for the same reason, an image Oc is formed by the rays falling on SR.\n\nNow in both cases, as the rays EFR, WGR, coming from the two opposite limbs of the sun, and forming the point of contact of the two limbs, proceed in the same direction RQ, they must thus accompany each other through the eye-glass and also through the eye, whatever refractive power it has, and therefore to every eye the images must appear to touch. Now the angle aRb is twice the refraction of the prism, and the angle aCb is the diameter of the sun; and as these angles are very small, and have the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUBTENSE\">subtense</a> ab, we have the angle aRb : angle aCb :: CQ : RQ.\n\nNow as CQ is constant, and also the angle aRb being twice the refraction of the prism, the angle aCa varies as RQ. Hence the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the scale for measuring angles becomes the focal length of the object-glass, and the angle measured is in proportion to the distance of the prisms from the principal focus of the object-glass; and the micrometer can measure all angles (very small ones excepted, for the reason given in Art. 19.) which do not exceed the sum of the refractions of the prisms; for the angle aCb, the diameter of the object to be measured, is always larger than the angle aRb, the sum of the refractions of the prisms, except when the prisms touch the object glass, and then they become equal. The scale can never be out of adjustment, as the point o, where the measurement begins, answers to the focus of the object-glass, which is a fixed point for all distant objects, and we have only to find the value of the scale answering to some known angle: for instance, bring the two limbs of the sun's images into contact, and measure the distance of the prisms from the focus, and look in the nautical almanac for the sun's diameter, and you get the value of the scale.\n\nIn fig. 8, the limb Q of the image Oc, is illuminated by the rays falling on the object glass between A and F, and of the image Qd by those falling between B and G; but in fig. 9, the same limbs are illuminated by the rays falling between B and F, A and G respectively, and therefore will be more illuminated than in the other case; but the difference is not considerable in achromatic telescopes, on account of the great aperture of the object glass compared with the distance FG.\n\nIt might be convenient to have two sets of prisms, one for measuring angles not exceeding 30', and therefore fit for measuring the diameters of the sun and moon, and the lucid parts and distances of the cusps in their eclipses; and another for measuring angles not much greater than 1', for the convenience of measuring the diameters of the planets. For as QC : QR :: sum of the refractions of the prisms : angle aCb, the apparent diameter of the object, it is evident that if you diminish the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a>, you must increase the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> in the same ratio, in order to measure the same Micrometer; and thus by diminishing the refractive angle of the prisms, you throw them further from Q, and consequently avoid the inconvenience of bringing them near to Q, for the reason in the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARAGRAPH\">paragraph</a>; and at the same time you will increase the illumination in a small degree. The prisms must be achromatic, each composed of two prisms of flint and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> glass, placed with their refracting angles in contrary directions, otherwise the images will be coloured.\n\nIn the construction here described, the angle measured becomes evanescent when the prisms come to the principal focus of the object-glass, and therefore o on the scale then begins: but if the prisms be placed in the principal focus they can have no effect, because the pencil of rays at the junction of the prisms would then vanish, and therefore it is not practicable to bring the two images together to get o on the scale. Dr. Maskelyne, therefore, thought of placing another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of prisms within, to refract the rays before they came to the other prisms, by which means the two images would be formed into one before they came to the principal focus, and therefore o on the scale could be determined. But to avoid the error arising from the multiplication of mediums, he, instead of adding another pair of prisms, divided the object-glass through its centre, and sliding the segments a little it separated the images, and then by the prisms he could form one image very distinctly, and consequently could determine o on the scale; for by separating the two segments you form two images, and you will separate the two pencils so that you may move up the two prisms, and the two pencils will fall on each respectively, and the two images may be formed into one. In the instrument which Dr. Maskelyne had made, o on the scale was chosen to be about 3' of the focal length of the object-glass, and each prism refracted 27'. By this means all angles are measured <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to o.\n\nIn the Philosophical Transactions for 1779, Mr. Ramsden has described two new micrometers, which he contrived with a view of remedying the defects of the object-glass micrometer.\n\nOne of these is a catoptric micrometer, which, beside the advantage it derives from the principle of reflecting reflection, of not being disturbed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HETEROGENEITY\">heterogeneity</a> micrometer of light, avoids every defect of other micrometers, and can have no aberration, nor any defect arising from the imperfection of materials or of execution; as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> simplicity of its construction requires no additional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRRORS\">mirrors</a> or glasses to those required for the telescope; and the separation of the images being effected by the inclination of the two specula, and not depending on the focus of any lens or mirror, any alteration in the eye of an observer cannot affect the angle measured. It has peculiar to itself the advantages of an adjustment, to make the images coincide in a direction perpendicular to that of their motion; and also of measuring the diameter of a planet on both sides of the zero, which will appear no inconsiderable advantage to observers who know how much easier it is to ascertain the contact of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> edges of two images than their perfect coincidence.\n\nA represents the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> speculum divided into two equal parts; one of which is fixed on the end of the arm B; the other end of the arm is fixed on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> axis.\nMicrometer X, which crosses the end of the telescope C. The other half of the mirror A is fixed on the arm D, which arm at the other end terminates in a socket g; that turns on the axis X; both arms are prevented from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a> by the braces a a. G represents a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> screw, having one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> e cut into double the number of threads in an inch to that of the part g; the part e having 100 threads in one inch, and the part g 50 only. The screw e works in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a> F in the side of the telescope, while the part g turns in a nut H, which is attached to the arm B; the ends of the arms B and D, to which the mirrors are fixed, are separated from each other by the point of the double screw pressing against the fluid h, fixed to the arm D, and turning in the nut H on the arm B. The two arms B and D are pressed against the direction of the double screw e g by a spiral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> within the part n, by which means all shake or play in the nut H, on which the measure depends, is entirely prevented.\n\nFrom the difference of the threads on the screw at e and g, it is evident, that the progressive motion of the screw through the nut will be half the distance of the separation of the two halves of the mirror; and consequently the half mirrors will be moved equally in contrary directions from the axis of the telescope C.\n\n23. The wheel V fixed on the end of the double screw has its circumference divided into 100 equal parts, and numbered at every fifth division with 5, 10, &c., to 100, and the index I shows the motion of the screw with the wheel round its axis, while the number of revolutions of the screw is shown by the divisions on the same index. The steel screw at R may be turned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KEY\">key</a> S, and serves to incline the small mirror at right angles to the direction of its motion. By turning the finger-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> T, the eye tube P is brought nearer or farther from the small mirror, to adjust the telescope to distinct vision; and the telescope itself hath a motion round its axis for the convenience of measuring the diameter of a planet in any direction. The inclination of the diameter measured with the horizon is shown in degrees and minutes by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> and vernier on a graduated circle, at the breech of the telescope.\n\n24. Besides the table for reducing the revolutions and parts of the screw to minutes, seconds, &c., it will require a table for correcting a small error which arises from the eccentric motion of the half-mirrors. By this motion their centres of curvature will approach a little towards the large mirror: the equation for this purpose in small angles is infinibl; but when angles to be measured exceed ten minutes, it should not be neglected. Or, the angle measured may be corrected by diminishing it in the proportion the verified sine of the angle measured, supposing the eccentricity radius, bears to the focal length of the small mirror.\n\n25. Mr Ramsden preferred Caflgrain's construction of the reflecting telescope to either the Gregorian or Newtonian; because in the former, the errors of one speculum are corrected by those of the other. From a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of the reflecting telescope, not generally known, that the apertures of the two specula are to each other very nearly in the proportion of their focal lengths, it follows, that their aberrations will be in the same proportion; and these aberrations will be in the same direction, if the two specula are concave; or in contrary directions, if one speculum is concave and the other convex. In the Gregorian telescope, both specula being concave, the aberration at the second image will be the sum of the aberrations of the two mirrors; but in the Caflgrainian telescope one mirror being concave and the other convex, the aberration at the second image will be the difference between the two aberrations. By assuming such proportions for the foci of the specula as are generally used in the reflecting telescope, which is about as 1 to 4, the aberration in the Caflgrainian construction will be to that in the Gregorian as 3 to 5.\n\n26. The other is a dioptric micrometer, or one suited to the principle of refraction. This micrometer is applied to the erect eye-tube of a refracting telescope, and is placed in the conjugate focus of the first eyeglas: in which position, the image being considerably magnified before it comes to the micrometer, any imperfection in its glass will be magnified only by the remaining eye-glasses, which in any telescope seldom exceeds five or six times. By this position also the size of the micrometer glass will not be the $\\frac{1}{\\text{v}}$ part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> which would be required if it was placed in the object-glas; and, notwithstanding this great disproportion of size, which is of great moment to the practical optician, the same extent of scale is preserved, and the images are uniformly bright in every part of the field of the telescope.\n\n27. Fig. 12. represents the glasses of a reflecting telescope; x y, the principal pencil of rays from the object-glas O; t u and u v, the axis of two oblique pencils; a, the first eye-glas; m, its conjugate focus, or the place of the micrometer; b the second eye-glas; c the third; and d the fourth, or that which is nearest the eye. Let p be the diameter of the object-glas, e the diameter of a pencil at m, and f the diameter of the pencil at the eye; it is evident, that the axes of the pencils from every part of the image will cross each other at the point m; and e, the width of the micrometer-glas, is to p the diameter of the object-glas, as m a is to g o, which is the proportion of the magnifying power at the point m; and the error caused by an imperfection in the micrometer glass placed at m will be to the error, had the micrometer been at O, as m is to p.\n\n28. Fig. 13. represents the micrometer; A, a convex lens bisected by a plane across its centre; one of these semi-lenses is fixed in a frame B, and the other in the frame E; which two frames slide on a plate H, and are pressed against it by thin plates a a: the frames B and E are moved in contrary directions by turning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTON\">button</a> D: L is a scale of equal parts on the frame B; it is numbered from each end towards the middle with 10, 20, &c. There are two verniers on the frame E, one at M and the other at N, for the convenience of measuring the diameter of a planet, &c., on both sides the zero. The first division on both these verniers coincides at the same time with the two zeros on the scale, L; and, if the frame is moved towards the right, the relative motion of the two frames is shown on the scale L by the vernier M; but if the frame B be moved towards the left, the relative motion is shown by the vernier N.\u2014This micrometer has a motion round the axis of vision, for the convenience of measuring the diameter of a planet, &c., in any direction, by turning...\ning an endless screw F; and the inclination of the diameter measured with the horizon is shown on the circle g by a vernier on the plate V. The telescope may be adjusted to distinct vision by a screw, which moves the whole eye-tube with the micrometer nearer to or farther from the object-glass, as telescopes are generally made; or the same effect may be produced without moving the micrometer, by sliding the part of the eye tube m on the part n, by help of a screw or pinion.\n\n29. Notwithstanding these improvements on micrometers, they are still liable to many sources of error. The imperfections of the wire micrometer, (which was still the most correct instrument for measuring small angles) when employed to determine the distance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> double stars, have been ably pointed out by Dr. Herschel.\n\n30. When two stars are taken between the parallel wires the diameters must be included. Dr. Herschel has in vain attempted to find lines sufficiently thin to extend them across the centres of the stars so that their thickness might be neglected. The threads of the silk-worm, with such lenses as he uses, are too much magnified that their diameter is more than that of many of the stars. Besides, if they were much smaller, the deflection of light would make the attempt to measure the distance of the centres this way fruitless; for he has always found the light of the stars to play upon those lines and separate their apparent diameters into two parts. Now since the spurious diameters of the stars thus included, are continually changing with the state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, and the length of time we look at them, we are, in some respects, left at an uncertainty; and our measures taken at different times, and with different degrees of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, will vary on that account. Nor can we come at the true distance of the centres of any two stars, unless we know the semidiameters of the stars themselves; for different stars have different apparent diameters, which, with a power of 227, may differ from each other as far as two seconds (D).\n\n31. The next imperfection arises from a deflection of light upon the wires when they approach very near to each other; for if this be owing to a power of repulsion lodged at the surface, it is easy to see that such powers must interfere with each other, and give the measures larger in proportion than they would have been if the repulsive power of one wire had not been opposed by a contrary power of the other wire.\n\n32. Another disadvantage of these micrometers is an uncertainty of the real zero. The least alteration in the situation and quantity of light will affect the zero; and a change in the position of the wires will sometimes produce a difference. To remove this difficulty Dr. Herschel always found his zero while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> preserved the situation which it had when his observations were made; but this introduces an additional observation.\n\n33. The next imperfection, is that every micrometer hitherto used requires either a screw, or a divided <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> and pinion, to measure the distance of the wires or the two images. Those acquainted with works of this kind are sensible how difficult it is to have screws perfectly equal in every thread or revolution of each thread; or pinions and bars that shall be so evenly divided as to be depended upon in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a> and tooth to the two or three thousandth part of an inch: and yet, on Microme-\n\naccount of the small scale of these micrometers, these quantities are of the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>; an error of a single thousandth part inducing in most instruments a mistake of several seconds.\n\n34. The greatest imperfection of all is, that the wires require to be illuminated; and when Dr. Herschel had double stars to measure, one of which was very obscure, he was obliged to be content with less light than is necessary to make the wires distinct; and several stars on this account could not be measured at all, though not too close for the micrometer.\n\nDr. Herschel, therefore, was led to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> his attention to the improvement of these instruments; and the result of his endeavours has been a very ingenious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a>-micrometer, which is not only free from the imperfections above specified, but also possesses the advantages of a large scale.\n\n35. It is represented in fig. 14, where A B G C F E is a Dr. Her-\n\nFig. 14.\nand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, upon which a semicircular board (the lamp-ghoq) is moveable upwards or downwards, and is held ter-\nin its situation by a peg p put into any one of the holes of the upright piece A R. This board is a segment of a circle of fourteen inches radius, and is about three inches broader than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEMICIRCLE\">semicircle</a>, to give room for the handles r D, e P, to work. The use of this board is to carry an arm L, thirty inches long, which is made to move upon a pivot at the centre of the circle, by means of a string, which passes in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROOVE\">groove</a> upon the edge of the semicircle ghoq; the string is fastened to a hook at o (not expressed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, being at the back of the arm L), and passing along the groove from o h to q is turned over a pulley at q, and goes down to a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARREL\">barrel</a> e, within the plane of the circular board, where a double-jointed handle e P commands its motion. By this contrivance, we see, the arm L may be lifted up to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a> from the horizontal position to the perpendicular, or be suffered to descend by its own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> below the horizontal to the reverse perpendicular situation. The weight of the handle P is sufficient to keep the arm in any given position; but if the motion should be too easy, a friction spring applied to the barrel will moderate it at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>.\n\n36. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of the arm L a final slider, about three inches long, is moveable in a rabbet from the end L towards the centre backwards and forwards. A string is fastened to the left side of the little slider, and goes towards L, where it passes round a pulley at m, and returns under the arm from m, n, towards the centre, where it is led in a groove on the edge of the arm, which is of a circular form, upwards to a barrel (raised above the plane of the circular board) at r, to which the handle r D is fastened. A second string is fastened to the slider, at the right side, and goes towards the centre, where it passes over a pulley n; and the weight w, which is suspended by the end of this string, returns the slider towards the centre, when a contrary turn of the handle permits it to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a>.\n\n37. By a and b are represented two small lamps, two inches high, 1/2 in breadth by 1/2 in depth. The sides, back, and top, are made so as to permit no light to be seen, and the front consists of a thin brass sliding door. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> in the lamp a is placed three-tenths of an inch\n\n(D) These imperfections are remedied in the instrument described in p. 801.\nMicrometers from the left side, three-tenths from the front, and half an inch from the bottom. In the lamp b it is placed at the same height and distance, measuring from the right side. The wick of the flame consists only of a single very thin lamp cotton thread; for the smallest flame being sufficient, it is easier to keep it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> in so confined a place. In the top of each lamp must be a little slit lengthways, and a small opening in one side near the upper part, to permit the air to circulate to feed the flame. To prevent every reflection of light, the side opening of the lamp a should be to the right, and that of the lamp b to the left. In the sliding door of each lamp is made a small hole with the point of a very fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a> just opposite the place where the wicks are burning, so that when the sliders are shut down, and everything dark, nothing shall be seen but two fine lucid points of the size of two stars of the third or fourth magnitude. The lamp c is placed so that its lucid point may be in the centre of the circular board where it is fixed. The lamp d is hung to the little slider which moves in the rabbet of the arm, so that its lucid point, in an horizontal position of the arm, may be on a level with the lucid point in the centre. The moveable lamp is suspended upon a piece of braids fastened to the slider by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">pin</a> exactly behind the flame, upon which it moves as a pivot. The lamp is balanced at the bottom by a leaden weight, so as to remain upright, when the arm is either lifted above or depressed below the horizontal position. The double-jointed handles rD, eP, consist of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> rods, 10 feet long, and the lowest of them may have divisions, marked upon it near the end P, expressing exactly the distance from the central lucid point in feet, inches, and tenths.\n\n38. Hence we see, that a person at a distance of 10 feet may govern the two lucid points, so as to bring them into any required position south or north preceding or following from 0 to 90\u00b0 by using the handle P, and also to any distance from six-tenths of an inch to five or six and twenty inches by means of the handle D. If any reflection or appearance of light should be left from the top or sides of the lamps, a temporary screen, consisting of a long piece of pasteboard, or a wire frame covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> cloth, of the length of the whole arm, and of any required breadth, with a slit of a half an inch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> in the middle, may be affixed to the arm by four bent wires projecting an inch or two before the lamps, situated so that the moveable lucid point may pass along the opening left for that purpose.\n\nFig. 15 represents part of the arm L, half the real size; S the slider; m the pulley, over which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CORD\">cord</a> xyzyz is returned towards the centre; v the other cord going to the pulley n of fig. 14. R the braids piece moveable upon the pin e, to keep the lamp upright. At R is a wire riveted to the braids piece, upon which is held the lamp by a nut and screw. Fig. 16, 17 represent the lamps a, l, with the sliding doors open, to show the situation of the wicks. W is the leaden weight with a hole d in it, through which the wire R of fig. 15, is to be passed when the lamp is to be fastened to the slider S. Fig. 18 represents the lamp a with the sliding door shut; f the lucid point; and i the openings at the top, and s at the sides, for the admission of air.\n\n39. The motions of this micrometer are capable of great improvement by the application of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a> and pinions, and other mechanical resources; but as the principal object is only to be able to adjust the two lucid points to the required position and distance, and to keep them there for a few minutes, while the observer measures their distance, it will be unnecessary to say more upon the subject.\n\n40. It is well known that we can with one eye look into a telescope, and see an object much magnified, while the other eye may see a scale upon which the magnified <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> is thrown. In this manner Dr Herschel generally determined the power of his telescopes; and anyone who has been accustomed to make such observations will seldom mistake so much as one in fifty in determining the power of an instrument, and that degree of exactness is fully sufficient for the purpose.\n\n41. When Dr Herschel uses this instrument he puts it at ten feet distance from the left eye, in a line perpendicular to the tube of his Newtonian telescope, and raises the moveable board to such a height that the lucid point of the central lamp may be upon a level with the eye. The handles, lifted up, are passed through two loops fastened to the tube, just by the observer, to as to be ready for his use. The end of the tube is cut away, so as to leave the left eye entirely free to see the whole micrometer.\n\n42. The telescope being directed to a double star, it is viewed with the right eye, and at the same time with the left it is seen projected upon the micrometer; then, by the handle P, the arm is raised or depressed so as to bring the two lucid points to a similar situation with the two stars; and, by the handle D, the moveable lucid point is brought to the same distance of the two stars, so that the two lucid points may be exactly covered by the stars.\n\n43. With a rule divided into inches and forty parts, the distance of the lucid points is thus determined with the greatest accuracy; and the measure thus obtained is the tangent of the magnified angle under which the stars are seen to a radius of ten feet; therefore, the angle being found and divided by the power of the telescope, the real angular distance of the centres of a double star is ascertained. On September 25, 1781, Dr Herschel measured a Herculis with this instrument. Having caused the two lucid points to coincide with the stars, he found the radius or distance of the central lamp from the eye 10 feet 4.45 inches; the tangent or distance of the two lucid points 50.6 forty parts of an inch; this gives the magnified angle 35\u00b0, and dividing by the power 460, we obtain 4\" 34\"' for the distance of the centres of the two stars. The scale of the micrometer at this convenient distance, with the power of 460, is above a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of an inch to a second; and by putting on a power of 922, we obtain a scale of more than half an inch to a second, without increasing the distance of the micrometer; whereas the most perfect micrometers, with the same instrument, had a scale of less than the two thousandth part of an inch to a second.\n\n44. Mr Brewster has lately directed his attention to Mr Brewster's improvement of micrometers, and has invented one in her's particular which appears to be highly deserving of notice in this place. In this instrument a pair of fixed wires is made to subtend different angles by varying the magnifying power of the telescope, by sliding one tube within another; whereas in all other micrometers with wires...\nwires this effect is produced by mechanical contrivances. Mr Brewster's method of shutting and opening the wires optically is therefore free from all those sources of error to which other micrometers are subject, and renders it particularly useful to the practical astronomer; while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of changing the magnifying power by the motion of a second object glass affords a length of scale equal to the local distance of the principal object-glass. The same principle is peculiarly applicable to the Gregorian telescope; for the magnifying power of this instrument can be changed by merely increasing or diminishing the distance of the eye-piece from the large speculum.\n\n45. In the common micrometer, which can manifestly, as well as Mr Cavallo's and Mr Brewster's, be used in the measurement of distances, the focal length of the telescope to which it is attached remains always the same; so that a correction computed from an optical theorem must be applied to every angle that is measured; but in Mr Brewster's telescope and micrometer, the focal length varies in the same proportion as the distance of the object; and consequently no correction of the angles can be necessary. To obviate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of having a stand for the instrument, which would prevent its usefulness at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, Mr Brewster divides the second or moveable object-glass into two, as in the divided object-glass micrometer. By this contrivance two images are formed, and these images are separated or made to form different angles at the eye, by bringing the moveable object-glass nearer to the fixed one. In determining the angle, therefore, we have only to bring the two images of the object into contact; and such contact the eye is capable of ascertaining even during the agitation of a carriage, as the two images retain the same relative position whatever be their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> motion.\n\nThis ingenious instrument, being formed with sliding tubes, is very portable and convenient; and will be found extremely useful to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> gentlemen, and others who may wish to ascertain distances without a more cumbersome apparatus. Haidy's Nat. Phil. by Gregory, v. ii. p. 427.\n\n46. Mr Brewster, we understand, still continues to direct his attention to the subject of micrometers, keeping in view the improvement of these instruments, not only in greater accuracy of construction, but also in their more extensive application to various practical purposes. An account of those uses and improvements is to form the subject of an appropriate publication; and, if we are rightly informed, the author deems them of sufficient importance to secure to himself, by patent, the exclusive right to the advantages which he thinks will arise from using them.\n\n47. A very simple micrometer for measuring small angles with the telescope has been invented by Mr Cavallo. It consists of a thin and narrow slip of mother-of-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEARL\">pearl</a> finely divided, and situated in the focus of the eye-glass of a telescope, just where the image of the object is formed. It is immaterial whether the telescope be a refractor or a reflector, provided the eye-glass be a convex lens.\n\nThe simplest way of fixing it is to stick it upon the diaphragm, which generally stands within the tube, in the focus of the eye-glass. When thus fixed, the divisions of the micrometrical scale will appear very distinct, unless the diaphragm is not exactly in the focus; in which case, the scale must be placed accurately in the focus of the eye-glass, either by moving the diaphragm, or by interposing any thin substance, such as paper or card between it and the scale. This construction is fully sufficient, when the telescope is always to be used by the same person; but when different persons are to use it, then the diaphragm which supports the micrometer must be constructed so as to be easily moved backwards or forwards, though that motion need not be greater than about \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) or \\( \\frac{1}{16} \\) of an inch.\n\nThe scale of the micrometer is represented in fig. 19 (fig. 19), which is about four times greater than one which Mr Cavallo has adapted to a three feet achromatic telescope that magnifies about 84 times. It is something less than the 24th part of an inch broad; its thickness is equal to that of common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> paper; and the length of it is determined by the breadth of the field of view. The divisions are 2000ths of an inch, and the lines which form them reach from one edge of the scale to about the middle of it, excepting every fifth and tenth division, which are longer. Two divisions of the scale in the telescope already mentioned are very nearly equal to one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>; and as a quarter of one of those divisions may be easily distinguished by the eye, an angle of one-eighth part of a minute, or of \\( \\frac{7}{3} \\), may be measured with it.\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> through a telescope furnished with such a micrometer, the field of view appears divided by the micrometer scale, the breadth of which occupies about \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)th of the aperture; and as the scale is semitransparent, that part of the object which is behind it may be discerned sufficiently well to ascertain the division, with which its borders coincide. Fig. 20 shows the appearance of the field of the telescope with the micrometer, when directed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> page of the Philosophical Transactions, in which it appears that the thickness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> C is equal to three-fourths of a division, the diameter of the O is equal to three divisions, and so on.\n\n48. After having adapted this micrometer to the telescope, we must then ascertain the value of the divisions. It is hardly necessary to mention in this place, that though those divisions measure the chords of the angles, and not the angles or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> themselves, and the chords are not as the arches, yet in small angles the chords, arches, sines, and tangents, follow the same proportion to very nearly, that the difference may be safely neglected: so that if one division of this micrometer is equal to one minute, we may conclude, that two divisions are equal to two minutes, three divisions to three minutes, and so on. In order to ascertain the value of the divisions of this micrometer, the following simple and accurate method may be adopted.\n\nMark upon a wall the length of six inches, by making two dots or lines six inches asunder, or by fixing a six inch ruler upon a stand; then place the telescope before it so that the ruler or six-inch length may be at right angles with the direction of the telescope, and just 37 feet 3\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inches distant from the object-glass of the telescope: this done, look through the telescope at the ruler or other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of six inches, and observe how many divisions of the micrometer are equal to it, and that same number of divisions is equal to half a degree, or \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) as may be shown by plane <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIGONOMETRY\">trigonometry</a>.\n\n49. When this value has been once ascertained, any other angle measured by any other number of divisions is determined by simple proportion. Thus, if the diameter of the sun seen through the same telescope, be equal to\nMicrometer. 12 divisions, say as \\( \\frac{1}{11} \\) divisions are to 30 minutes, so are 12 divisions to \\( \\left( \\frac{12}{11} \\times \\frac{30}{1} \\right) = 31.3 \\), which is the required diameter of the sun.\n\nNotwithstanding the facility of this calculation, a scale may be made answering to the divisions of a micrometer, which will show the angle corresponding to any number of divisions by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> inspection. Thus, for the above-mentioned small telescope, the scale is represented in fig. 21. AB is a line drawn at pleasure; it is then divided into 23 equal parts, and those divisions which represent the divisions of the micrometer that are equal to one degree, are marked on one side of it. The line then is divided again into 60 equal parts, which are marked on the other side of it; and these divisions represent the minutes which correspond to the divisions of the micrometer; thus the figure shows, that six divisions of the micrometer are equal to \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) minutes, \\( \\frac{1}{11} \\) divisions are nearly equal to 20 minutes, &c. What has been said of minutes may be said of seconds also, when the scale is to be applied to a large telescope.\n\nSo we shall therefore add some practical rules to render this micrometer useful to persons unacquainted with trigonometry and the use of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOGARITHMS\">logarithms</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBLEM\">Problem</a> I. The angle, not exceeding one degree, which is subtended by an extension of one foot perpendicular to the axis of the telescope being given, to find its distance from the object-glass of the telescope.\n\nRule 1. If the angle be expressed in minutes, say, as the given angle is to 60, so is 687.55 to a fourth proportional, which gives the answer in inches.\n\nExample. At what distance is a globe of one foot diameter when it subtends an angle of two seconds?\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2''}{3600''} : \\frac{687.55}{60} = \\frac{3600 \\times 687.55}{2} = 1237590\n\\]\n\ninches, or 10313 feet, which is the answer required.\n\nProblem II. The angle, not exceeding one degree, which is subtended by any known extension, being given, to find its distance from the object-glass of the telescope.\n\nRule. Proceed as if the extension were of one foot by Problem I, and call the answer B; then, if the extension in question be expressed in inches, say, as 12 inches are to that extension, so is B to a fourth proportional, which is the answer in inches; but if the extension in question be expressed in feet, then you need only multiply it by B, and the product is the answer in inches.\n\nExample. At what distance is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> six feet high, when he appears to subtend an angle of 30\u00b0?\n\nBy Problem I. If the man were one foot high, the distance would be 82506 inches; but as he is six feet high, therefore multiply 82506 by 6, and the product gives the required distance, which is 495036 inches, or 41253 feet.\n\nFor greater convenience, especially in travelling, or in such circumstances in which one has not the opportunity of making even the easy calculations required in those problems, the following two tables have been computed; the first of which shows the distance answering to any angle from one minute to one degree, which is subtended by a man, the height of which has been called an extension of six feet; because, at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a>, such is the height of a man when dressed with hat and Microshoes on.\n\nThus, if it is required to measure the extension of a street, let a foot ruler be placed at the end of the street; measure the angle it subtends, which suppose to be 36\u00b0, and in the table you will have the required distance opposite 36\u00b0, which is 9\u00bd feet. Thus also a man who appears to be 49' high, is at the distance of 421 feet.\n\nAngles subtended by an Extension of one Foot at different Distances.\n\n| Angles | Distances in Feet |\n|--------|------------------|\n| Min.   | 1                |\n|        | 3437.7           |\n|        | 1718.9           |\n|        | 1145.9           |\n|        | 859.4            |\n|        | 687.5            |\n|        | 572.9            |\n|        | 491.1            |\n|        | 429.7            |\n|        | 382.0            |\n|        | 343.7            |\n|        | 312.5            |\n|        | 286.5            |\n|        | 264.4            |\n|        | 245.5            |\n|        | 229.2            |\n|        | 214.8            |\n|        | 202.2            |\n|        | 191.0            |\n|        | 180.9            |\n|        | 171.8            |\n|        | 162.7            |\n|        | 156.2            |\n|        | 149.4            |\n|        | 143.2            |\n|        | 137.5            |\n|        | 132.2            |\n|        | 127.3            |\n|        | 122.7            |\n|        | 118.5            |\n|        | 114.6            |\n\nAngles subtended by an Extension of six Feet at different Distances.\n\n| Angles | Distances in Feet |\n|--------|------------------|\n| Min.   | 1                |\n|        | 20626.8          |\n|        | 10313.3          |\n|        | 6875.4           |\n|        | 5156.5           |\n|        | 4125.2           |\n|        | 3437.7           |\n|        | 2916.6           |\n|        | 2578.2           |\n|        | 2291.8           |\n|        | 2062.6           |\n|        | 1875.2           |\n|        | 1718.8           |\n|        | 1586.7           |\n|        | 1473.3           |\n|        | 1375.1           |\n|        | 1298.1           |\n|        | 1213.3           |\n|        | 1145.9           |\n|        | 1085.6           |\n|        | 1031.4           |\n|        | 982.2            |\n|        | 937.6            |\n|        | 866.8            |\n|        | 859.4            |\n|        | 825.1            |\n|        | 793.3            |\nMr Brewster's circular mother-of-pearl micrometer.\n\nThe following is the account of a micrometer invented by Mr Brewster, of the circumstances which led to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, and of its advantages. We shall give it in his own words:\n\n\"In the winter of 1805 (he observes), when I was employed in delineating the surface of the moon, I wished to measure the diameter of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> spots by applying Mr Cavallo's micrometer to a thirty-inch achromatic telescope made by Berge. But as the eyepiece was moved by a rack and pinion, and consequently could not turn round its axis, the micrometer must have remained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a>, and could only measure angles in one direction. This difficulty, indeed, might have been surmounted by a mechanical contrivance for turning the diaphragm about its centre, or more simply by giving a motion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a> to the tube which contains the third and fourth eye-glasses. Such a change in the eye-piece, however, was both inconvenient and difficult to be made. Mr Cavallo's micrometer, therefore, has this great disadvantage, that it cannot be used in reflecting telescopes, or in any achromatic telescope where the adjustment of the eye-piece is effected by rackwork, unless the structure of these instruments is altered for the purpose. Another disadvantage of this micrometer arises from the slip of mother-of-pearl passing through the centre of the field. The picture in the focus of the eye-glass is broken into two parts, and the view is rendered still more unpleasant by the inequality of the segments into which the field is divided. In addition to these disadvantages, the different divisions of the micrometer are at unequal distances from the eye-glass which views them, and therefore can neither appear equally distinct nor subtend equal angles at the eye.\n\nFinding that Mr Cavallo's instrument laboured under these imperfections, I thought of a circular mother-of-pearl micrometer which is free from them all, and has likewise the advantage of a kind of diagonal scale, increasing in accuracy with the angle to be measured. This micrometer, which I got executed by Miller and Adie, optical instrument-makers in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, and which I have often used, both in determining small\n\n| Angles | Distances in Feet |\n|--------|------------------|\n| Min. 27 | 763.9 |\n| 28     | 736.6 |\n| 29     | 711.3 |\n| 30     | 687.5 |\n| 31     | 665.4 |\n| 32     | 644.5 |\n| 33     | 625.5 |\n| 34     | 606.6 |\n| 35     | 589.3 |\n| 36     | 572.9 |\n| 37     | 557.5 |\n| 38     | 542.8 |\n| 39     | 528.9 |\n| 40     | 515.6 |\n| 41     | 503.1 |\n| 42     | 491.1 |\n| 43     | 479.7 |\n\n| Angles | Distances in Feet |\n|--------|------------------|\n| Min. 44 | 46.88 |\n| 45     | 45.84 |\n| 46     | 44.84 |\n| 47     | 43.89 |\n| 48     | 42.97 |\n| 49     | 42.17 |\n| 50     | 41.25 |\n| 51     | 40.44 |\n| 52     | 39.67 |\n| 53     | 38.92 |\n| 54     | 38.19 |\n| 55     | 37.51 |\n| 56     | 36.83 |\n| 57     | 36.19 |\n| 58     | 35.56 |\n| 59     | 34.96 |\n| 60     | 34.37 |\n\nangles in the heavens and such as are subtended by terrestrial objects, is represented in fig. 27, which exhibits its appearances in the focus of the fourth eye-glass. The black ring, which forms part of the figure, is the diaphragm, and the remaining part is a ring of mother-of-pearl, having its interior circumference divided into 365 equal parts. The mother-of-pearl ring, which appears connected with the diaphragm, is completely separate from it, and is fixed at the end of a brass tube which is made to move between the third eye-glass and the diaphragm, so that the divided circumference may be placed exactly in the focus of the glass next the eye. When the micrometer is thus fitted into the telescope, the angle subtended by the whole field of view, or by the diameter of the innermost circle of the micrometer, must be determined either by measuring a base or by the passage of an equatorial star, and the angles subtended by any number of divisions or degrees will be found by a table constructed in the following manner.\n\nLet \\( A \\) \\( m \\) \\( p \\) \\( n \\) \\( B \\), fig. 28, be the interior circumference of the micrometer scale, and let \\( m \\) \\( n \\) be the object to be measured. Bisect the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> \\( m \\) \\( n \\) in \\( p \\), and draw \\( C \\) \\( m \\), \\( C \\) \\( p \\), \\( C \\) \\( n \\). The line \\( C \\) \\( p \\) will be at right angles to \\( m \\) \\( n \\), and therefore \\( m \\) \\( n \\) will be twice the sine of half the arch \\( m \\) \\( n \\). Consequently, \\( A \\) \\( B \\) : \\( m \\) \\( n \\) = rad. fine of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) \\( m \\) \\( p \\) \\( n \\); therefore \\( m \\) \\( n \\times R = \\sin \\frac{1}{2} m \\) \\( p \\) \\( n \\times A \\) \\( B \\), and \\( m \\) \\( p \\) \\( n = \\frac{\\sin \\frac{1}{2} m \\) \\( p \\) \\( n \\times A \\) \\( B}{R} = \\frac{\\sin \\frac{1}{2} m \\) \\( p \\) \\( n}{R} \\times A \\) \\( B \\); a formula by which the angle subtended by the chord of any number of degrees may be easily found. The first part of the formula, viz. \\( \\frac{\\sin \\frac{1}{2} m \\) \\( p \\) \\( n}{R} \\) is constant, while \\( A \\) \\( B \\) varies with the size of the micrometer and with the magnifying power which is applied. We have therefore computed the following table, containing the value of the constant part of the formula for every degree or division of the scale.\n\n| Deg. | Constant Part of the Formula

In order to find the angle subtended by any number of degrees, we have only to multiply the constant part of the formula corresponding to that number in the table by A.B., or the angle subtended by the whole field. Thus if A.B. is 30 minutes, as it happens to be in the micrometer which I have constructed, the angle subtended by 1 degree of the scale will be $30 \\times 0.009 = 16\\frac{1}{2}$ seconds, and the angle subtended by 40 degrees will be $30 \\times 0.342 = 10\\frac{1}{2} \\times 15.6''$; and by making the calculation it will be found that as the angle to be measured increases, the accuracy of the scale also increases; for when the arch is only 1 or 2 degrees, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of 1 degree produces a variation of about 16 seconds in the angle; whereas when the arch is between 170 and 180, the variation of a degree does not produce a change much more than one second in the angle. This is an important advantage in the circular scale, as in Cavallo's micrometer a limit is necessarily put to the size of the divisions.\n\n\"It is obvious, from an inspection of fig. 27, that there is no occasion for turning the circular micrometer round its axis, because the divided circumference lies in every possible direction. In fig. 2, for example, if the object has the direction a b it will be measured by the arch a o b, and if it lies in the line c d it will be measured by the arch c r d.\"\n\n\"In the circular micrometer which I have been in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of using, A.B., or the diameter of the field of view, is exactly half an inch, the diameter of the brass tube in which it is fixed is one inch, the length of the tube half an inch, and the degrees of the divided circumference $\\frac{1}{4}$ th of an inch.\"\n\n54. II. The micrometer has not only been applied to telescopes, and employed for astronomical purposes; but there have also been various contrivances for adapting it to MICROSCOPICAL observations. Mr Leeuwenhoek's method of estimating the size of small objects was by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a>, comparing them with grains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, of which 100 in diameter to a line took up an inch. These grains he laid upon the microscope, placed plate with his objects, and viewed them at the same time. Dr Jurin's method was similar to this; for he found the diameter of a piece of fine silver wire, by wrapping it as close as he could about a pin, and observing how many rings made an inch; and he used this wire in the same manner as Leeuwenhoek employed his sand. Dr Hooke looked upon the magnified object with one eye, while at the same time he viewed other objects placed at the same distance with the other eye. In this manner he was able, by the help of a ruler, divided into inches and small parts, and laid on the pedestal of the microscope, to call it as it were the magnified appearance of the object upon the ruler, and thus exactly to measure the diameter which it appeared to have through the glass; which being compared with the diameter as it appeared to the naked eye, showed the degree in which it was magnified.\n\n55. Mr Martin recommended such a micrometer for Martin's microscope as had been applied to telescopes; for he advises to draw a number of parallel lines on a piece of glass, with the fine point of a diamond, at the distance of one fourtieth of an inch from one another, and to place it in the focus of the eye-glass. By this method, Dr Smith contrived to take the exact draught of objects viewed by a double microscope; for he advises to get a lattice, made with small silver wires or squares, drawn upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> glass by the strokes of a diamond, and to put it into the place of the image, formed by the object glass; then by transferring the parts of the object, seen in the squares of the glass or lattice upon similar corresponding squares drawn on paper, the picture may be exactly taken. Mr Martin also introduced into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> microscopes another micrometer, consisting of a screw.\n\n65. The mode of actual measurement (Mr Adams observes) is without doubt the most simple that can be used; as by it we comprehend, in a manner, at one glance, the different effects of combined glasses; and as it saves the trouble, and avoids the obscurity, of the usual modes of calculation: but many persons find it exceedingly difficult to adopt this method, because they have not been accustomed to observe with both eyes at once. To obviate this inconvenience, the late Mr Adams contrived an instrument called the Needle-Micrometer, which was first described in his Micrographia Illustrata; and of which, as now constructed, we have the following description by his son Mr George Adams in the ingenious Essays above quoted.\n\nThis micrometer consists of a screw, which has 50 threads to an inch; this screw carries an index, which points to the divisions on a circular plate, which is fixed at right angles to the axis of the screw. The revolutions of the screw are counted on a scale, which is an inch divided into 50 parts; the index to these divisions is a flower-de-luce marked upon the slider, which carries the needle point across the field of the microscope. Every revolution of the micrometer screw measures $\\frac{1}{50}$ th part of an inch, which is again subdivided by means of the divisions on the circular plate,\nMicrometer.\n\nMicrometer as this is divided into 20 equal parts, over which the index passes at every revolution of the screw; by which means we obtain with ease the measure of 1000th part of an inch: for 50, the number of threads on the screw in one inch, being multiplied by 20, the divisions on the circular plate are equal to 1000; so that each division on the circular plate shows that the needle has either advanced or receded 1000th part of an inch.\n\n57. To place this micrometer on the body of the microscope, open the circular part FKH, fig. 25, by taking out the screw G, throw back the semicircle FK, which moves upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> at K; then turn the sliding tube of the body of the microscope, so that the small holes which are in both tubes may exactly coincide, and let the needle g of the micrometer have a free passage through them; after this, screw it fast upon the body by the screw G. The needle will now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRAVERSE\">traverse</a> the field of the microscope, and measure the length and breadth of the image of any object that is applied to it.\n\nBut further affluence must be had, in order to measure the object itself, which is a subject of real importance; for though we have ascertained the power of the microscope, and know that it is so many thousand times, yet this will be of little affluence towards ascertaining an accurate idea of its real size; for our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of bulk being formed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of one object with another, we can only judge of that of any particular body, by comparing it with another whose size is known: the same thing is necessary, in order to form an estimate by the microscope; therefore, to ascertain the real measure of the object, we must make the point of the needle pass over the image of a known part of an inch placed on the stage, and write down the revolutions made by the screw, while the needle passed over the image of this known measure; by which means we ascertain the number of revolutions on the screw, which are adequate to a real and known measure on the stage. As it requires an attentive eye to watch the motion of the needle point as it passes over the image of a known part of an inch on the stage, we ought not to trust to one single measurement of the image, but ought to repeat it at least five times; then add the five measures thus obtained together, and divide their sum by five, or the number of trials; the quotient will be the mean of all the trials. This result is to be placed in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> of a table next to that which contains the number of the magnifiers.\n\n58. By the affluence of the sectoral scale, we obtain with ease a small part of an inch. This scale is shown at figs. 22, 23, 24, in which the two lines ca, cb, with the side ab, form an isosceles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a>; each of the sides is two inches long, and the base still only of one-tenth of an inch. The longer sides may be of any given length, and the base still only of one tenth of an inch. The longer lines may be considered as the line of lines upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECTOR\">sector</a> opened to one-tenth of an inch. Hence whatever number of equal parts ca, cb are divided into, their transverse measure will be such a part of one-tenth as is expressed by their divisions. Thus if it be divided into ten equal parts, this will divide the inch into 100 equal parts; the first division next e will be equal to 100th part of an inch, because it is the tenth part of one-tenth of an inch. If these lines are divided into twenty equal parts, the inch will be by that means divided into 200 equal parts. Lastly, if ab, ca, are made three inches long, and divided into 100 equal parts, we obtain with ease the 1000th part. The scale is represented as folio at fig. 23, but as perforated at fig. 22, and 24, so that the light passes through the aperture, when the sectoral part is placed on the stage.\n\n59. To use this scale, first fix the micrometer, fig. 25, to the body of the microscope; then fit the sectoral scale, fig. 24, in the stage, and adjust the microscope to its proper focus or distance from the scale, which is to be moved till the base appears in the middle of the field of view; then bring the needle point g, fig. 25, (by turning the screw L) to touch one of the lines ca, exactly at the point answering to 20 on the sectoral scale. The index a of the micrometer is to be set to the first division, and that on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAL\">dial</a> plate to 20, which is both the beginning and end of its divisions; we are then prepared to find the magnifying power of every magnifier in the compound microscope which we are using.\n\n60. Example. Every thing being prepared agreeable to the foregoing directions, suppose you are desirous of ascertaining the magnifying power of the lens marked No. 4, turn the micrometer screw until the point of the needle has passed over the magnified image of the tenth part of an inch; then the division, where the two indices remain, will show how many revolutions, and parts of a revolution, the screw has made, while the needle point traversed the magnified image of the one-tenth of an inch; suppose the result to be 26 revolutions of the screw, and 14 parts of another revolution, this is equal to 26 multiplied by 20, added to 14; that is, 534,000 parts of an inch.\u2014The 26 divisions found on the straight scale of the micrometer, while the point of the needle passed over the magnified image of one-tenth part of an inch, were multiplied by 20, because the circular plate CD, fig. 25, is divided into 20 equal parts; this produced 520; then adding the 14 parts of the next revolution, we obtain the 534,000 parts of an inch, or five tenths and 3400 parts of another tenth, which is the measure of the magnified image of one-tenth of an inch, at the aperture of the eye-glasses or at their foci. Now if we suppose the focus of the two eye-glasses to be one inch, the double thereof is two inches; or if we reckon on the 1000th part of an inch, we have 2000 parts for the distance of the eye from the needle point of the micrometer. Again, if we take the distance of the image from the object at the stage at 6 inches, or 6000, and add thereto 2000, double the distance of the focus of the eye-glasses, we shall have 8000 parts of an inch for the distance of the eye from the object; and as the glasses double the image, we must double the number 534 found upon the micrometer, which then makes 1068; then, by the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a>, we shall obtain the number of times the microscope magnifies the diameter of the object; say, as 240, the distance of the eye from the image of the object, is to 800, the distance of the eye from the object; so is 1068, double the measure found on the micrometer, to 3563, or the number of times the microscope magnifies the diameter of the object. By working in this manner, the magnifying power of each lens used with the compound microscope may be easily found, though the result will\nbe different in different compound microscopes, varying according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of the lenses, their distance from the object and one another, &c.\n\n61. Having discovered the magnifying power of the microscope, with the different object-lenses that are used therewith, our next subject is to find out the real size of the objects themselves, and their different parts: this is easily effected, by finding how many revolutions of the micrometer screw answer to a known measure on the sectorial scale or other object placed on the stage; from the number thus found, a table should be constructed, expressing the value of the different revolutions of the micrometer with that object lens, by which the primary number was obtained. Similar tables must be constructed for each object lens. By a set of tables of this kind, the observer may readily find the measure of any object he is examining; for he has only to make the needle point traverse over this object, and observe the number of revolutions the screw has made in its passage, and then look into his table for the real measure which corresponds to this number of revolutions, which is the measure required.\n\n62. Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COVENTRY\">Coventry</a> of Southwark has favoured us with the description of a micrometer of his own invention; the scale of which, for minuteness, surpasses every instrument of the kind of which we have any knowledge, and of which, indeed, we could scarcely have formed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>, had he not indulged us with several of these instruments, graduated as underneath.\n\nThe micrometer is composed of glass, ivory, silver, &c., on which are drawn parallel lines from the 10th to the 10,000th part of an inch. But an instrument thus divided, he observes, is more for curiosity than use; but one of those which Mr Coventry has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENT\">lent</a> us is divided into squares, so small that fifteen millions of them are contained on the surface of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> inch, each square appearing under the microscope true and distinct; and though so small, it is a fact, that animalcula are found which may be contained in one of these squares.\n\nThe use of micrometers, when applied to microscopes, is to measure the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> size of the object, and how much that object is magnified. To ascertain the real size of an object in the single microscope, nothing more is required than to lay it on the micrometer, and adjust it to the focus of the magnifier, noticing how many divisions of the micrometer it covers. Suppose the parallel lines of the micrometer to be the 1000th of an inch, and the object covers two divisions; its real size is 500ths of an inch; if five, 200ths, and so on.\n\nBut to find how much the object is magnified, is not mathematically determined so easily by the single as by the compound microscope: but the following simple method (says Mr Coventry) I have generally adopted, and think it tolerably accurate. Adjust a micrometer under the microscope o, say the 100th of an inch of divisions, with a small object on it; if square, the better: notice how many divisions one side of the object covers, suppose 10; then cut a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> paper something larger than the magnified appearance of the object: then fix one eye on the object through the microscope, and the other at the same time on the paper, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOWERING\">lowering</a> it down till the object and the paper appear level and distinct: then cut the paper till it appear exactly the size of the magnified object; the paper being then measured, suppose an inch square: Now, as the object under the magnifier, which appeared to be one inch square, was in reality only ten hundredths, or the tenth of an inch, the experiment proves that it is magnified ten times in length, one hundred times in superficies, and one thousand times in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a>, which is the magnifying power of the glass; and, in the same manner, a table may be made of the power of all the other glasses.\n\nIn using the compound microscope, the real size of the object is found by the same method as in the single; but to demonstrate the magnifying power of each glass to greater certainty, adopt the following method.\u2014Lay a two-feet rule on the stage, and a micrometer level with its surface (an inch suppose, divided into 100 parts): with one eye see how many of those parts are contained in the field of the microscope, (suppose 50); and with the other, at the same time, look for the circle of light in the field of the microscope, which with a little practice will soon appear distinct; mark how much of the rule is intercepted by the circle of light, which will be half the diameter of the field. Suppose eight inches; consequently the whole diameter will be sixteen. Now, as the real size of the field, by the micrometers, appeared to be only 50 hundredths, or half an inch, and as half an inch is only one 32d part of 16 inches, it shows the magnifying power of the glass to be 32 times in length, 1024 superficies, and 32,768 cube (E).\n\n63. Another way of finding the magnifying power of compound microscopes, is by using two micrometers of the same divisions; one adjusted under the magnifier, the other fixed in the body of the microscope in the focus of the eye-glass. Notice how many divisions of the micrometer in the body are seen in one division of the micrometer under the magnifier, which again must be multiplied by the power of the eye-glass. Example: Ten divisions of the micrometer in the body are contained in one division under the magnifier; so far the power is increased ten times: now, if the eye-glass be one inch focus, such glass will itself magnify about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> times in length, which, with the ten times magnified before, will be seven times ten, or 70 times in length, 4900 superficies, and 343,000 cube.\n\n\"If (says Mr Coventry) these micrometers are employed in the solar microscope, they divide the object into squares on the screen in such a manner as to render it extremely easy to make a drawing of it. And (says he) I apprehend they may be employed to great advantage with such a microscope as Mr Adams's lenticular; because this instrument may be used either by day or night, or in any place, and gives the actual magnifying power without calculation.\"\n\n(e) It will be necessary, for great accuracy, as well as for comparative observations, that the two-feet rule should always be placed at a certain distance from the eye: eight inches would, in general, be a proper distance.\nThe case with which we have been favoured by Mr Coventry contains six micrometers, two on ivory and four on glass. One of those on ivory is an inch divided into one hundred parts, every fifth line longer than the intermediate ones, and every tenth longer still, for the greater ease in counting the divisions under the microscope, and is generally used in measuring the magnifying power of microscopes. The other ivory one is divided into squares of the 50th and 100th of an inch, and is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> employed in measuring opaque objects.\n\nThose made of glass are for transparent objects, which, when laid on them, show their natural size.\u2014That marked on the bars 100, are squares divided to the 100th of an inch; that marked 5000 are parallel lines forming nine divisions, each division the 1000th of an inch; the middle division is again divided into 5, making divisions to the 5000th of an inch. That marked 10,000 is divided in the same manner, with the middle division divided into 10, making the 10,000th of an inch. Example:\n\nThe glass micrometer without any mark is also divided, the outside lines into 100th, the next into 1000th, and the inside lines into the 4000th of an inch: these are again crossed with an equal number of lines in the same manner, making squares of the 100th, 1000th, and 4000th of an inch, thus demonstrating each other's size. The middle square of the 1000th of an inch (see fig. 26.) is divided into sixteen squares; now as 1000 squares in the length of an inch, multiplied by 1000, gives one million in an inch surface; by the same rule, one of those squares divided into 16 must be the sixteen millionth part of an inch surface. See fig. 26, which is a diminished view of the apparent surface exhibited under the magnifier No. 1. of Wilson's microscope. In viewing the smallest lines, Mr Coventry uses No. 2. or 3.; and they are all better seen, he says, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> than by day-light.\n\nMICR\u00d3PUS, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASTARD\">BASTARD</a> CUDWEED: A genus of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> belonging to the syngenesia class, and in the natural method ranking under the 49th order, Compositae.

In some notices concerning this subject which we have seen, it is observed that this science is more intimately connected with the Egyptian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIEROGLYPHICS\">hieroglyphics</a> than is generally thought, and that this connection may help to explain them. In Germany this art has been revived by M. Aretin; and a pupil of his, M. Kaestner has been permitted to teach Mnemonica the new doctrine at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEIPZIG\">Leipzig</a>, but on the express condition of not allowing his hearers to write <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> his lectures. This seems to be a singular, and we may add a silly prohibition. The following account is given of this art in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> in the beginning of 1807. \"During my residence, says the writer, in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a> I heard a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of a new method of mnemonique, or of a method to assist and fix our memory, invented by Gregor de Feinaigle. Notwithstanding the simplicity with which he announced his lectures in the papers, I could not determine myself to become a pupil of his, as I thought to find a quack or mountebank, and to be laughed at by my friends for having thrown away my cash in such a foolish manner. Perhaps I should hesitate to this moment about the utility of this newly invented method to assist our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> memory, had I not had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> of dining at his excellency's the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> of Metternich, the Austrian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a>, who followed, with all his secretaries, the whole course of lectures: they all spoke very advantageously of it, likewise several other persons of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> I met there: in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this I was invited into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of pupils, and I follow, at this moment, the lectures. All I can tell you about this method is, it is a very simple one, and easy to be learned, adapted to all ages and sexes: all difficulties in such sciences as require an extraordinary good memory, for instance, the names and epochs in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, are at once overcome and obviated. There is not one branch of science to which this method cannot be applied. It is easy to be perceived that such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> without some critique, and even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARCE\">farce</a>, in the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINTS\">prints</a>: some of them were very injurious, and plausible enough to mislead the public, who, knowing nothing of the method, are always more ready to condemn than to assist. Mr Feinaigle, to answer all these critics at once, adopted a method not less public for Paris than the public papers, but let's public for the rest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>: he gave, the 24th of last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, a public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> to about 2000 spectators, in which he did not appear at all, only about 12 or 15 of his pupils; each of them made such an application of the method as his situation in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> required. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> parts were the following: history, about names and years; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a>, with respect to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a>, latitude, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of inhabitants, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> miles, &c. &c.; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GRAMMAR\">grammar</a> in various languages, about different editions of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>; pandects, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of each book, title, &c.; different systems of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">botany</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">arithmetic</a>, &c. &c.

It may however be deduced from principles more elementary, by reasoning as follows. Let PCQ be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEMICIRCLE\">semicircle</a>, and ABCDE several successive sides of a regular polygon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a> in it.

Bisect AB in L, and draw AF, LM, BG, CH, &c. perpendicular to PQ. For the sake of brevity, let circ. AF denote the circumference of a circle whose radius is AF. Then because AF, BG, LM, are to each other respectively as circ. AF, circ. BG, circ. LM (Geom. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">Sect</a>. VI. Prop. 4.), and because \\(\\frac{1}{2}(AF + BG) = LM\\), therefore \\(\\frac{1}{2}(\\text{circ. AF} + \\text{circ. BG}) = \\text{circ. LM}\\). Now the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> of the surface generated by the chord AB is \\(\\frac{1}{2}(\\text{circ. AF} + \\text{circ. BG})(\\times AB)\\) (Prob. 3.) therefore the same area is also equal to \\((\\text{circ. LM}) \\times AB\\). Draw AO <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to FG, and draw LN to the centre of the circle. Then the triangles AOB, OLM are manifestly similar; therefore \\(AB : AO :: NL : LM :: \\text{circ. NL} : \\text{circ. LM}\\); and hence \\(AO \\times \\text{circ. NL} = AB \\times \\text{circ. LM}\\). But this last quantity has been proved equal to the surface generated by AB, therefore the same surface is equal to \\(AO \\times \\text{circ. NL}\\), or to \\(FG \\times \\text{circ. NL}\\), that is, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTANGLE\">rectangle</a> contained by FG and the circumference of a circle inscribed in the polygon. In the same way it may be shown that the surfaces generated by BC, CD, DE, are respectively equal to \\(GH \\times \\text{circ. LN}, HI \\times \\text{circ. LN}, IK \\times \\text{circ. LN}\\). Therefore the whole surface generated by the chords AB, BC, CD, DE, &c. is equal to \\((FG + GH + HI + IK) \\times \\text{circ. LN} = FK \\times \\text{circ. LN}\\). Conceive now the number of chords between A and E to be indefinitely increased; then, observing that the limit of the surface generated by the chords is the surface generated by the arch ABCDE, and that the limit of NL is NP, the radius of the generating circle, it follows that the spherical surface or zone generated by the arch ACE is equal to the product of the circumference of the sphere by FK the height of the zone.\n\nEx. 1.

The\nVol. XIII. Part II.\n\n(A) The story is as follows: After St Paul had made some stay at Messina (a circumstance of his travels\nunnoticed by St Luke), the Messinese prevailed upon him to return to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a> with an embassy of four\npersons sent by the city to the Virgin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>. Their excellencies were graciously received by her, and brought\nback a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> written with her own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> tongue, which St Paul translated into Greek. By\nthe irruption of the Saracens this invaluable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a> was lost, and utterly forgotten till the year 1467, when\nConstantine Lascaris, a refugee Greek, found a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of it, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> it into Latin, made it known to the\ncitizens, and then to all the Catholic world. Its authenticity is now so well established at Messina, that Regna\nthe historian candidly acknowledges, that whoever was to confess even a doubt on the subject in that city would\nbe treated as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDEL\">infidel</a>.\n\nThis curious epistle is conceived in these terms:\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARIA\">Maria</a> Virgo, Joachim filia, Dei humillima Christi Jesu\ncrucifixi mater, ex tribu Iuda, stirpe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAVID\">David</a>, Messianentibus omnibus salutem, et Dei Patris Omnipotentis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-BENE\">bene</a>-\ndictionem.

Nonas Junii,\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUNA\">luna</a> XXVII. feria V. ex Hierofolymis.\n\nThus translated:\u2014\"The Virgin Mary, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Joachim, most humble mother of God, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> Christ\ncrucified, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> of Juda and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of David, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> and the blessing of God the Father Almighty\nto all the people of Messina. Out of the abundance of your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, you have, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of a public de-\nliberation, sent a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPUTATION\">deputation</a> to me; and since you acknowledge that my Son is both God and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, and that\nhe ascended into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a> after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESURRECTION\">resurrection</a>, as you have learned from the preaching of St Paul the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOSTLE\">apostle</a>,\npretensions to pre-eminence over the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, nay over the whole world; to its virtues and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a> they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> every piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a>, and to their own unworthiness all finister events that have befallen them. The authenticity of this epistle has been seriously impugned, and of course vigorously defended by many Sicilian divines and disputators.\n\nThere is another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> in this city that deserves particular notice, not so much on account of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> ornaments, as for its being the last refuge of the Greek liturgy, which was once the predominant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of the island, but gradually abolished by different conquerors. It is dedicated to the Virgin Mary de Graffico, or of the Letter, which denomination may perhaps have furnished Lascaris with the idea of his letter. It is known at present by the name of la Cattolica. According to the Greek canons, the entrance of monastic churches was reciprocally forbidden to each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>, and the cathedrals were the only places of worship where a daily sacrifice was offered up by the bishop and clergy, and where both men and women were present at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, but in different parts of the church. From this general admittance the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> acquired the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Catholic or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a>.\n\nMezzina is all paved with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAVA\">lava</a>, cut into large flags of two feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>: a material which the vicinity of lavas renders it easy to procure, and which being very hard resists friction better than any other.\n\nDuring a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of ages, notwithstanding the various revolutions and calamities to which it has been exposed, this city has still maintained its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> situation; while most other cities have shifted their ground more or less from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where they were first founded. But its situation enjoys advantages which have still tempted such of its inhabitants as escaped from the ravages of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> and the desolation of earthquakes, to prefer it to every other spot, however delightful or secure. It is of very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> origin; it has been under many different races of monarchs; and its name has been repeatedly changed: it has been at different times called Zancle, Mamertina, Mezzina. Its first name Zancle, which in the old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of Sicily meant \"a fickle;\" alluding, as some authors suppose, to the form of the port; or, according to others, to the fertility of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. Allured by the advantages of its situation, the Cumeans, a commercial and enterprising people, invaded the island and drove the Siculi from this settlement; they were in their turn overpowered by a band of Samian adventurers, who made way for a colony of citizens of Messina, and under these masters it changed its name to Mezzina. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> was of short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>; for in the 289th year before Christ it was destroyed by the Mamertines, a warlike unprincipled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> inhabiting the south part of Bruttium. These <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> being received into Messina on their return to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRACUSE\">Syracuse</a>, where they had served as mercenaries in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> of Agathocles, took an opportunity of massacring the inhabitants and usurping their possessions. The city was now called Mamertina; and, in order to support themselves against the resentment of the Sicilian powers, the Mamertines implored the protection of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, who, eager to extend their dominion beyond the limits of Italy, and jealous of the growing power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARTHAGE\">Carthage</a>, made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> scruple to succour these allies with a consular army. This step brought on the first Punic war. The Mamertines reaped no other fruit from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> but a more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a>; for such was the real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of their connexion with Rome, whatever name it might be disguised under.\n\nMezzina was, however, always distinguished by particular attentions and favours from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a>; and, excepting a short period during the wars of the triumvirate, appears to have tasted all the sweets of Roman prosperity, without partaking of the bitter draughts of adversity. Its fate, in the ruin of the empire, was similar to that of the rest of Sicily. In 829 Mezzina fell into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the Saracens, but obtained very honourable terms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITULATION\">capitulation</a>; for half the city was left to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>, where they were to be governed by their own laws, and professed their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> undisturbed. In the other resided the bey of one of the five provinces into which the Arabian conquerors had divided the island. Notwithstanding this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a>, Mezzina was the first to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> off the yoke in 1377, when George Maniaces landed an army of Greeks and Normans on the shore of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FARO\">Faro</a>. It afterwards held out against the whole Mahometan force, till the feeble state of a distracted empire put out all hopes of assistance from Constantinople. This unfortunate city then opened its gates to the army of the caliph, and felt very severely the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of his resentment, but it did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> groan under the yoke; for in less than 20 years Roger the Norman took it by surprise and delivered it from Mahometan oppression. During the crusade our Richard Coeur de Lion and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> Augustus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of France wintered here in their way to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALESTINE\">Palestine</a>; a sojourn marked by continual quarrels, conflagration, and bloodshed. The Mezzinese were particularly tardy in entering into the national <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a> of 1282, but afterwards exceeded the rest of the insurgents in deeds of cruelty: This, and the importance of their situation, flung them out for the first objects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a>'s vengeance. He invested their city closely, and declared to openly his determination to refuse all terms whatever to the beleaguered, that they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> no hopes of safety but in an obstinate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>. Their courage, perseverance, and sufferings, were excessive; at length their strength and resources began to fail rapidly, and every circumstance seemed to denounce their speedy destruction, when Roger Lauria appeared off the harbour with the Aragonian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a>, forced the king to retire with precipitation across the\n\nI give my blessing to you and all your city, and agree to become your protectors. In the 42d year of my Son, the 1st of the Indiction, the 3d <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>, and the 27th of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, at Jerusalem.\"\n\nNot to dwell upon the astronomical blunders in these dates, let it suffice to observe, that Lascaris was not aware that Denis the Little, a Syrian monk in the 6th century, was the first who made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the era that commences at our Saviour's birth.\nthe straits, and in his flight defeated and destroyed his naval armament. Robert, grandson of Charles I., also made a fruitless attack; but in the disturbed reign of Frederick III., Messina was delivered up to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a> and his consort <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> Joan, who entered it in triumph. In a few years it returned to its former possessors. The year 1672 was remarkable for the revolt of the Messinese.\u2014They threw off the Spanish yoke, and swore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a> to Louis XIV., king of France. They were for some time vigorously afflicted by the French; but before the Spaniards had gained the least advantage to excite any hopes of recovering so valuable a possession, Louis found himself necessitated from motives of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> his new subjects, and leave them to the mercy of their old incensed masters. The horror of being thus abandoned, and the chastisement inflicted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, broke the fierce spirit of the Messinese; they were still stunned with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a> and effects of this blow, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a> in 1743 was introduced from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVANT\">Levant</a>, and swept away more than half the inhabitants. From this chain of calamities, the opulence, trade, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of Messina, have been gradually sinking; and unless very favourable circumstances happen, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> every year <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> lower. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of its inhabitants does not now exceed 35,000.\n\nThe following particulars are added from M. Houel, who visited this city since the late earthquakes, which completed its destruction.\n\nOn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a> there is a square, which, though not regular, is far from being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a>. This was not the largest square in Messina before its overthrow; but it was the most elegant, the most splendidly adorned, and the best frequented. There stands in this square an equestrian statue of Charles II., of Spain, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRONZE\">bronze</a>, which has been spared by the earthquake. It stands on a marble pedestal, in the middle of the square. Opposite to this statue is an elegant marble fountain, ornamented with a variety of figures, representing men and other animals, all of them spouting out <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> in great abundance; which used, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, to spread an agreeable and refreshing coolness over the square, that induced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> to assemble here. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">Seven</a> streets terminated here. The cathedral forms a part of the square. It is dedicated to the blest Virgin; the occasion of which has been already mentioned.\n\nThere is an anniversary feast celebrated in Messina, which is called the feast of the Letter. A lock of the Virgin's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>, which she sent to the Messenians at the same time with the letter, is carried through the city in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESSION\">procession</a> in a crystal vessel. She made also a present of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> to the Messenian deputies. It is placed over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABERNACLE\">tabernacle</a>. None but the canons of the cathedral are permitted to touch, or take up on their shoulders, the silver shrine in which the crystal vessel with the Virgin's hair is deposited. Eight of those canons, with mitres on their heads, bear this shrine in the procession. The canopy suspended over it is supported by six senators in their robes. The picture and the hair are shown to strangers. This procession, and the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> ceremonies of this festival, are followed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> races. The spirits of the people being already elevated by their religious exercises, they engage with amazing eagerness in these and the other diversions with which they are accompanied: a tumultuous joy reigns over the city; and the evening concludes with illuminations and fireworks. The ships in the harbour pay the citizens the compliment of entertaining them with a discharge of their guns on the occasion.\n\nThrough a square called the Square of the Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">Hospital</a>, runs a large and impetuous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORRENT\">torrent</a>, the Porta delle Legni. It is precipitated from those lofty mountains which overlook this city on the south side. The channel which it has cut out for itself is at times entirely full. It would, on such occasions, overflow the square and other parts of the city, were it not confined by walls which have been built on both sides to prevent such accidents.\u2014Another stream of a similar origin, called the Torrent of La Boceta, runs through another part of the city, it is also confined within walls to prevent it from overflowing.\n\nThe Square of St John of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MALTA\">Malta</a> is one of the largest in Messina. In the middle of this square is a fine marble fountain, ornamented with a variety of sculptured figures and jets d'eau. Beside the fountain there used to stand a large reservoir for horses to drink out of.\n\nIn the time of the annual festivals, there used to be exhibited on the water of the reservoir a galley, or rather a fictitious representation of a galley, with galley-slaves, soldiers, officers, and a commander on board, all in arms, and the galley properly equipped as a ship of war. This galley was decorated with great art; and by night the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASTS\">masts</a>, and every other suitable part, were hung with lamps, which illuminated it in a very splendid manner. Everything around was so artificially disposed, that when the fireworks were played off, the spectator was led to think, though he perceived only one galley, that the noise which he heard was produced by a naval <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a>; and that the other ships were concealed from his view by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> occasioned by the guns and fireworks. This, when properly conducted, was a noble spectacle. The festa repaired thither from the cathedral, attended with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> and a numerous company. In one carriage sat six senators, the governor of the city, and sometimes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a>. It was exceedingly large, and drawn by six <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> horses very richly harnessed. Other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a> followed, with the train who attended the governor and the senators.\n\nAlmost all festivals owe their origin to some extraordinary event, or some singular story either true or false. It is said, that when the splendor with which the feast of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">Assumption</a> de la <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARA\">Bara</a> was celebrated at Messina, first began to attract foreigners to the city, on that occasion such crowds repaired thither as to alarm the inhabitants with the fears of a famine: But one year, when the number of strangers was greater than usual at the time of this festival, the magistrates were very much at a loss how to supply them with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>; and at length, every other resource failing, no hopes of relief remained but from the kindness of the Blest Virgin. Fervent prayers were addressed to their patroness; and next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> by day-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> three brigantines appeared entering the harbour with full sails. They proved to be loaded with corn. It was eagerly purchased; and the people of the city halted to appease their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a>. But when they came after\nrefreshing themselves to pay the corn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, neither ships nor merchants could be found. After their first emotions of surprize had subsided, they naturally concluded that such a seasonable supply must undoubtedly be a present from the Virgin, who, being pleased with the zeal of her Messina votaries, and desirous to prevent the concourse of strangers who attended the festival from diminishing, had interposed in this miraculous manner to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> them from the distresses of famine. A new festival was celebrated in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> to their generous benefactress. Three small vessels of silver were made, and dedicated to the Virgin in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of the event; and these are at present used as lamps in the cathedral. The senate likewise decreed, that the clergy should pay annually a small tax, to be laid out in constructing a small gallery to swim on the fountain, and in defraying the expenses of the fireworks. The profits of the clergy are so considerable on the occasion of the festival, that they may be supposed to pay the tax with great cheerfulness.\n\nIn Messina, as in the other cities of Sicily, the women wrap themselves in a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> mantle above the neck of their dresses. The stuffs are richer or plainer according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> and circumstances. People who are not rich enough to have fine clothes of their own, hire them at so much an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>. There are women who make a livelihood by lending out their clothes. The mantle covers the wearer from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> to foot.\u2014It reduces the old and the young, the ill-shaped and the handsome, pretty much to an equality in point of appearance. This must naturally appear very unfavourable to the influence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>. But yet, on proper occasions, at church or in a public walk, the ladies of Messina find means to open and adjust the mantle so as to display all their beauties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> and shape, and to attract the affections of lovers, perhaps more powerfully than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> their dresses were suited to display their charms in a more ostentatious manner.\n\nBetween Messina and the tower of Faro there stands a small church called the Madonna of the Grotto. It was anciently a temple of a round structure, and ornamented with columns like the temple of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> at Rome. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">Modern</a> columns now supply the place that was occupied by the ancient. There are large niches in the rock adjoining to the temple, which are thought to be of equal antiquity. These contain no sculptured figures; but in Pagan times they might possibly contain some.\n\nMessina being situated between Mount Etna and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARYBDIS\">Charybdis</a>, and being likewise at no great distance from the volcanoes of Lipari and Stromboli, must have been in all ages liable to suffer by earthquakes. Such terrible events, however, appear to have been more unfrequent in ancient than in modern times, and have actually alarmed the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> oftener than any other. In the year 1693 a fourth part of the cities of Sicily was destroyed by an earthquake. Messina merely felt the shock; all its buildings, however, suffered. In the year 1742 it suffered another equally violent. A plague which followed in 1743 retarded the repairs necessary after the earthquake. In the year 1780 this city <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, for more than six months, to suffer from new earthquakes.\n\nWere the state of the elements, previous to these dreadful events, carefully examined, it might perhaps be found to undergo certain changes which might be considered as prognosticating them.\n\nThe autumn of the year 1782 was unusually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> and rainy. Fahrenheit's thermometer was often as low as 56 degrees. The succeeding winter was dry; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> never fell under 25 degrees: And, what is uncommon in that season, storms were now and then observed to arise from the west. The pilots in the channel observed that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a> no longer rose at the usual periods, and the gulf of Charybdis raged with extraordinary fury.\n\nOn the 5th of February 1783, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> was heavy and calm; and the sky obscured with thick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> seemingly all in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a>. About half after twelve at noon, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> began to shake with a dreadful noise. The shocks continually increased, and became at length so violent as to open the ground, and to overturn in two or three minutes a considerable part of the buildings.\n\nA long white cloud appeared to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-west; and soon after another, very dark, in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of the heavens. The latter in a moment spread over the whole horizon, and deluged the city with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIL\">hail</a>, accompanied with dreadful claps of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a>. The inhabitants fled in the utmost terror to the fields and the ships in the harbour.\n\nFrom mid-day till five in the afternoon the earthquake continued almost without interruption. The shocks then became somewhat less frequent. The cries of the dying; the shrieks of those who were half buried under the ruins; the wild terror with which others, who were still able, attempted to make their escape; the despair of fathers, mothers, and husbands, bereft of those who were dearest to them; then formed altogether a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of horror, such as can but seldom occur in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the calamities of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>. Amid that awful scene, instances of the most heroic courage and the most generous affection were displayed. Mothers, regardless of their own safety, rushed into every danger to snatch their children from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. Conjugal and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FILIAL\">filial</a> affection prompted deeds not less desperate and heroic. But no sooner did the earthquake cease, than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> wretches who had escaped began to feel the influence of very different passions. When they returned to visit the ruins, to seek out the situation of their fallen dwellings, to inquire into the fate of their families, to procure food and collect some remains of their former fortunes\u2014such as found their circumstances the most wretched became suddenly animated with rage, which nothing but wild despair could inspire. The distinction of ranks, and the order of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> were disregarded, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> eagerly violated. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">Murder</a>, rapine, and lawless robbery, reigned among the smoking ruins.\n\nAbout one in the morning another shock of the earthquake was felt, which overturned most of the houses that were still standing. Most of those whom want, or avarice, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>, still detained among the ruins, now shared the same fate with their friends whom the former shocks had buried under them.\n\nThe succeeding day scarce alleviated the distress of this dismal night: the few wretches who still survived found themselves destitute of every necessary. At length order was in some degree re-established; and in\ntwo days after every person was supplied at least with some small portion of the necessaries for subsistence.\n\nNone yet thought of returning to take up their abode among the ruins. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> people fixed their residence on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> of Porto Salvo, near the town of Salico. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a>, magistrates, and merchants, took up their abode on another plain, on the other side of the stream Porto de Legno; the soldiers at Terra Nuova.\n\nSome violent shocks which were again felt on the 7th of February and the 28th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> completed the destruction of the city. The corn magazines, however, escaped without damage; and the public ovens and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-AQUEDUCTS\">aqueducts</a> were but little injured. From these facts it may perhaps be inferred, that had not the houses of Messina been, in general, hastily built at the first, and afterwards carelessly repaired, fewer of them would have been overthrown by the earthquake.\n\nThe neighbouring villages having suffered but little, were the first to relieve the remaining inhabitants of Messina in their distresses. Maltese galleys for some days supplied necessaries to the poor and the sick with a generosity which merits the highest praise. They brought surgeons and whatever was needful for the cure of the wounded. The supplies sent by the king of France were refused, for what reason we know not. What money was needed for the support of the people was taken from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a> of the city of Messina; for what the king of Naples sent was seized and spent by the garrison.\n\nIt is said that not more than 800 or 900 persons perished by this earthquake. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> during that convulsion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> was slightly agitated in the harbour. Farther out the sea was more violently agitated; but none of the ships in the harbour were dashed to pieces. The waters rose so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> as to be injurious in a very considerable degree to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHAROS\">Pharos</a>, as well as along the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of Sicily and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAGNARA\">Bagnara</a>.\n\nThis earthquake was not of a momentary duration, like that by which Lithon was destroyed, and like many others; for more than sixty days, from the 5th of February to the beginning of April, Messina continued to be shaken, and in that time felt more than 200 shocks; and even after that period the alarm was again and again renewed. Not only the magistrates, the soldiers, and the people, but the priests likewise, with their tabernacle and altar, retired to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARRACKS\">barracks</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NUNS\">nuns</a>, too, deserted their cloisters, and sought a retreat without the walls. Some of them confined themselves to the gardens of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONVENTS\">convents</a>; others mixed indiscriminately with the people.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> damage which the public buildings within the city suffered was the fall of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOME\">dome</a> of the church of Purgatory. Only the walls were left standing; and even these had suffered considerably. One half of the steeple of the cathedral was beaten to the ground. The magazines of Porto Franco were likewise very much shattered. The fort of St Salvator, being built on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> foundation, the side next the sea is there fallen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>; but on the other side, where it is founded on a rock, it has stood unmoved by all the shocks of the earthquake.\n\nOn the 5th of February, when the earthquake was more violent than at any time afterwards, a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a> of sulphur was felt. The earth was affected somewhat in the same way as if it had been borne up on a fluid; and seemed to reel with the shocks much like a ship tossed with the waves. This tremulous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> was felt all over Sicily; but towards Pharos it became weaker. On the following days the sky was cloudy; the mountains of Sicily and the shores of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALABRIA\">Calabria</a> continued covered with a thick fog like smoke. North and north-east winds raged with the most violent impetuosity.\n\nThe disastrous year of this earthquake was scarce concluded, the chasms which it had opened in the ground were still yawning, and the poor inhabitants of the adjacent country still trembled with terror, when the elements again renewed their fury to ravage this miserable land.\n\nOn Tuesday the 6th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1784, about sunrise, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> began to blow softly from the north-east. The sea gradually swelled, rose beyond its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> with rapid impetuosity, overflowed the quay of Messina, and lashed with its billows the ruins of the Palazzata. It loosened and displaced many of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOLE\">mole</a>, spread over the whole street, and attacked the pedestals of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a> which had been spared by the earthquake, and still stood firm among the ruins. The same furious wind which swelled the sea in so extraordinary a manner, ravaged the whole coast from Messina all the way to Syracuse.","sp":153,"ep":157},{"h":"RULE","t":"Add into one sum 39 times the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of the bung diameter, 25 times the square of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> diameter, and 26 times the product of the diameters; multiply the sum by the length, and the product by .000343; then the last product divided by 9 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> give the wine gallons, and divided by 11 will give the ale gallons.\n\nIn investigating this rule the ingenious author assumed as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, that one-third of a cask at each end is nearly the frustum of a cone, and that the middle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> may be taken as the middle frustum of a parabolic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINDLE\">spindle</a>.

Dr Heberden gives a very accurate account of the symptoms produced by the acarides, from an eminent physician who was troubled with them all his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. They brought on an uneasiness in the rectum, and an almost intolerable itching in the anus; which sensations most usually came on in the evening, and prevented <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> for several hours. They were attended with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, sometimes so considerable as to produce a swelling in the rectum both\nboth internally and externally; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> these symptoms were not soon relieved, a tenesmus was brought on, with a mucous dejection. Sometimes there was a gripping pain in the lower part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABDOMEN\">abdomen</a>, a little above the os <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol0.html#article-PUBIS\">pubis</a>. If this pain was very severe, a bloody mucus followed, in which there were often found acarides alive. They were also sometimes suspected of occasioning disturbed sleep, and some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of headache.\n\nOn this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> Dr Heberden observes, that the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> of the patient did not seem to have suffered from the long continuance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, nor the immediate inconveniences of the disorder itself to have increased. \"It is (says he) perhaps universally true, that this kind of worms, though as difficult to be cured as any, yet is the least dangerous of all. They have been known to accompany a person through the whole of a long life, without any reason to suspect that they had halved its end. As in this case there was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> remarkable sickness, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGESTION\">indigestion</a>, giddiness, pain of the stomach, nor itching of the nose, possibly these symptoms, where they have happened to be joined with the acarides, did not properly belong to them, but arose from some other causes. There is indeed no one sign of these worms, but what in some patients <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be wanting.\"\n\nThe above mentioned patient used purging and irritating clysters with very little success. One dram and an half of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a> was infused in six ounces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; and the strained liquor being given as a clyster, occasioned a violent pain in the lower part of the abdomen, with faintness and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> sweat: this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INJECTION\">injection</a>, though retained only one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>, acted as a smart purge, but did little or no good. Lime-water was also used as a clyster; which brought on a catarrh, but had no good effect. Six grains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> were dissolved in six ounces of water, and injected. This clyster in a few minutes occasioned an aching in the rectum, gripped a little without purging, and excited a tenesmus. Some few acarides were brought off with it; but all of them were alive. The uneasy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> in the rectum did not abate till some warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> was thrown up. Whenever the tenesmus or mucous stools were thought worth the taking notice of, warm milk and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> generally gave immediate relief. If purging was necessary, the lenient purges, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANNA\">manna</a> with oil, were, in this particular case, made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of: <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-RHUBARB\">rhubarb</a> was found too stimulating.\u2014But, in general, the most useful purge, and which therefore was most usually taken, was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CINNAMON\">cinnamon</a> and rhubarb, of each half a drachm: this powder seldom failed to bring away a mucus as transparent as the white of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a>, and in this many acarides were moving about. The cinnamon frequently adhered to this mucus, which did not come off in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> quantities, when a purge was taken without cinnamon. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALOMEL\">Calomel</a> did no more than any other purge which operates briskly would have done; that is, it brought away acarides, with a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of mucus. Oil given as a clyster sometimes brought off the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol2.html#article-ANIMALCULES\">animalcules</a>: the oil swam on the surface of the mucus, and the acarides were alive and moving in the mucus itself, which probably hindered the oil from coming in contact with them and killing them.\n\nDr Heberden also observes, that mucus or slime is the proper nest of the acarides, in which they live, and is perhaps the food by which they are nourished; and it is this mucus which preserves them unhurt, though surrounded with many other liquors, the immediate touch of which would be fatal. It is hard to satisfy ourselves by what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTINCT\">instinct</a> they find it out in the human body, and by what means they get at it; but it is observable in many other parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, as well as here, that where there is a fit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> for the hatching and growth of animals and vegetables, nature has taken sufficient care that their seeds should find the way thither. Worms are said to have been found in the intestines of still-born <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a>. Purges, by lessening this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, never fail to relieve the patient; and it is not unlikely, that the worms which are not forced away by this quickened <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the intestines, may, for want of a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of it, languish, and at last die; for if the acarides are taken out of their mucus, and exposed to the open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, they become motionless, and apparently die in a very short time. Dr Heberden supposes that the kind of purge made use of is of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> in the cure of all other worms as well as acarides; the animals being always defended by the mucus from the immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of medicines; and that therefore those purges are the best which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> briskly, and of which a repetition can be most easily borne. Purging waters are of this sort, and jalap especially for children; two or more grains of which, mixed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>, are most easily taken, and may be repeated daily.\n\nFrom Dr Heberden's observations, we may easily see why it is so difficult to destroy these animals; and why anthelmintics, greatly celebrated for some kinds, are yet far from being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFICS\">specifics</a> in the disease. As the worms which reside in the cavities of the human body are never exposed to the air, by which all living creatures are invigorated, it is evident, that in themselves they must be the most tender and easily destructible creatures imaginable, and much less will be requisite to kill them than any of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> insects. The most pernicious substances to any of the common insects are oil, caustic fixed alkali, lime, and lime-water. The oil operates upon them by shutting up the pores of their bodies; the lime-water, lime, and caustic alkali, by dissolving their very substance. In the case of intestinal worms, however, the oil can have very little effect upon them, as they are defended from it by the moisture and mucus of the intestines; the like happens with lime-water: and therefore it is necessary that the medicine should be of such a nature as to destroy both mucus and insects together; for which purpose the caustic fixed alkali is at once safe and efficacious; nor is it probable that any case of worms whatever could resist the proper use of this medicine. A very large dose of any salt indeed will also destroy the mucus and destroy the worms; but it is apt to inflame and excoriate the stomach and intestines, and thus to produce worse distempers than that which it was intended to cure. Dr Heberden gives the following remarkable case of a patient cured of worms by enormous doses of common salt, after trying many other remedies in vain. In February 1757, the patient was seized with uncommon pains in his stomach, attended with nausea, vomiting, and constipation of bowels, and an almost total loss of sleep and appetite:\nWorms. He soon became much emaciated, and could neither stand nor walk upright; his belly grew small and hard, and closely retracted, insomuch that the sternum covered the navel, and the latter could scarce be discovered or felt by the finger: his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URINE\">urine</a> was always milky, and soon deposited a thick white sediment; his excrements were very hard and lumpy, resembling those of sheep, only of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>; nor had he ever a stool without some medicine or other to procure it. In this situation he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> four years; during which time he had been in an infirmary, attended by eminent physicians, but was disguised as incurable. At last he was advised by a neighbour to drink salt and water, as he said he knew one cured by it who had for many years been afflicted with the same kind of pains in the belly and stomach. As his distemper was now almost inapplicable, he willingly tried the experiment. Two pounds of common salt were dissolved in as little water as possible, all which he drank in less than an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>. Soon afterwards he found himself greatly oppressed at the stomach, grew extremely sick, and vomited violently; on the fourth straining he brought up about half a pint of small worms, part acariides, and the rest resembling those worms which are called the botus, and frequently met with in the stomach of horses, but much smaller, and about the size of a grain of wheat. The salt soon began to operate downwards, and he had five or six very copious fetid stools, tinged with blood; and in them discharged near an equal quantity of the same kind of worms he had vomited. Being greatly fatigued with the violence of the operations, he fell into a calm sleep, which lasted two hours, during which he sweated profusely, and awoke much refreshed. Instead of his usual pains, he now only complained of a rawness and soreness of his gullet, stomach, and bowels, with an almost unquenchable thirst; to allay which, he drank large quantities of cold water, whey, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a>-milk, or whatever he could get. The urine he now passed was small in quantity, and rendered with very great difficulty, being highly saturated with the salt, from whence arose a most troublesome dysuria and strangury. However, these symptoms gradually abated by a free use of the liquors above-mentioned; and on the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> he was so well recovered, that he took two pounds more of salt, dissolved in the like quantity of water. The effects were nearly similar to the former; only that most of the worms were now burnt, and came away with a considerable quantity of lime and mucus. The drought, strangury, &c. returned with their former violence, but soon yielded to the old treatment. He sweated very copiously for three days, slept easily, and by that time could extend his body freely: on the fifth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> he left his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a>, and, though very weak, could walk upright; his strength and appetite soon returned, and he became robust and well.\n\nThe anthelmintic medicines which have been recommended by one person or other, are in a manner innumerable; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> are,\n\n1. Quicksilver. This is very efficacious against all kinds of worms, either taken in the form of calomel or corrosive sublimate. Even the crude metal boiled in water, and the water drunk, has been recommended as an almost certain cure. But this, it is evident, can receive no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPREGNATION\">impregnation</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a>. If, therefore, it have any effect, it must be from some foreign and accidental impregnation. In most instances there can be no objection to mercury, but only that it is not endowed with any attenuating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> whereby the mucus in which these insects resides can be dissolved. It therefore fails in many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, though it will most certainly destroy worms where it can get at them.\n\n2. Powder of tin. This was for some time celebrated as a specific, and indeed we may reasonably expect good effects from it; as by its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> and grittiness it rubs off the mucus and worms it contains from the coats of the intestinal canal, in which case they are easily evacuated by purgatives. In order to produce any considerable effects, it must be given in a large dose.\n\n3. Geoffroa incrustis, or cabbage bark. This remedy is used by the inhabitants of Jamaica. The first account of it which appeared in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> was published in the Physical and Literary Essays, vol. ii., by Mr Duguid surgeon in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>. He acquaints us, that the inhabitants of Jamaica, young and old, white and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, are much infested with worms, especially the long round sort; the reason of which, he thinks, is the quantity of sweet viscid vegetables which they eat. On dissecting a child of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> months old, who died of vomiting and convulsions, twelve large worms were found; one of them filled the appendix vermiformis, and three of them were entwined in such a manner as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a> up the valvula Tulpia, so that nothing could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> from the small to the great guts.\u2014The cabbage bark, however, he tells us, is a safe and effectual remedy, and the most powerful vermifuge yet known; and that it frequently brings away as many worms by stool as would fill a large hat. He owns that it has sometimes violent effects; but this he attributes to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NEGROES\">negroes</a> who make the decoction (in which form the bark is used) too strong, and not to the remedy itself.\n\nMr Anderson, surgeon in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, has also given an account of this bark and its operation, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to Dr Duncan, published in the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> iv. p. 84. From this account it appears, that there are two different kinds of cabbage bark; the one much paler than the other: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> kind operates much more violently than the other. It often occasions loose stools, great nausea, and such like symptoms, attended with great uneasiness in the belly: in one or two instances it was suspected of inducing syncope. The darker coloured kind resembles the calca lignea, though it is of a much coarser texture. This kind, Mr Anderson thinks, may be exhibited in any case where an anthelmintic is necessary; the dangerous symptoms might have followed either from the use of the first kind, or from an over-dose of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>. The usual method of preparing the medicine is by boiling two ounces and a half of the bark in two quarts of water to a pint and a half. Of this a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a>-spoonful may be given at first in the morning, gradually increasing the quantity till we come to four or five <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>-spoonfuls in a day. When exhibited in this manner, Mr Anderson informs us, that he never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> it produce any violent symptoms, and has experienced the best effects from it as an anthelmintic. After the use of this decoction for eight\nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> mornings successively, a dose of jalap with calomel must be given, which seldom fails to bring away the worms, some dead, some alive. If at any time the decoction produce more than one or two loose stools, a few drops of liquid laudanum may be given; and, in general, Mr Anderson gave 15 or 20 drops of the spirit of lavender with each dose.\n\nIn a letter from Dr Ruth, professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILADELPHIA\">Philadelphia</a>, to Dr Duncan of Edinburgh, the following account is given of another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> of this medicine. \"It has long (says he) been a complaint among physicians, that we have no vermicide medicine which can be depended upon. Even calomel fails in many cases where there are the most pathognomonic signs of worms in the bowels. But this complaint, it is hoped, is now at an end. The physicians of Jamaica have lately found, that the cabbage bark, as it is called in the West Indies, made into a syrup with brown sugar, is an infallible antidote to them. I have used above 30 pounds of it, and have never found it fail in one instance. The syrup is pleasant; it sometimes pukes, and always purges, the first or second time it is given.\"\n\nThe most accurate botanical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the geoffreana inermis, or the tree furnishing the worm bark, as it has often been called, is that which was published some years ago in the Philosophical Transactions by Dr Wright, formerly physician at Jamaica, now of Edinburgh, who also highly extols this remedy as an anthelmintic.\n\nNotwithstanding these encomiums, however, the cabbage bark has not come into general use in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>. But diseases from the tereter, or lumbrici as they are often called, the species of worm against which this bark is employed, much less frequently occur in Britain than in some other countries. When they do occur, in almost every instance they readily yield to more gentle and safe anthelmintics; and the worms may not only be expelled by calomel, but by the vegetable bitters; as the powder of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTEMISIA\">artemisia</a> fantonica, or the like.\n\n4. Couhage, or cow itch. This is the Dolichos serus or pruriens of Linn\u00e6us; and the principles on which it acts have been already explained under the article Dolichos. It is somewhat similar to the powder of tin, but bids fair for being more efficacious. It might at first appear to occur as objections to this medicine, that by the hairs of it entangling themselves with one another, calculi might be formed in the intestines, or obstructions equally bad; or if the sharp <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> and hooks with which it abounds were to adhere to the nervous coats of the intestines themselves, they might occasion a fatal irritation, which could not be removed by any means whatever. But from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> of those who have employed it extensively in practice, it would appear, that these objections are entirely theoretical; and that it may be employed with perfect safety. The episcule, gently scraped off from a single pod, and mixed with syrup or molasses, are taken for a dose in the morning fasting. This dose is repeated in this manner for two or three days without any sensible operation; but even a very slight purgative taken afterwards has been found to discharge an almost incredible quantity of worms. And according to Dr Bancroft, who has given a very particular account of its use in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">Natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUIANA\">Guiana</a>, it is one of the safest and most certain anthelmintics yet discovered; but, as well as the bark of the Geoffrea, it has hitherto been very little used in Britain, probably from its not being necessary.\n\n5. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> pink. This plant, which is the Spigelia marilandica of Linn\u00e6us, is also an American plant, and was first recommended in the Edinburgh Physical and Literary Essays by Dr Gardiner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLESTOWN\">Charlestown</a> in South Carolina. He is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that a vomit ought always to precede the use of it; and informs us, that half a dram of it purges as briskly as the same quantity of rhubarb. At other times he has known it produce no effect on the belly though given in very large quantity: In such cases it becomes necessary to add a grain or two of sweet mercury, or some grains of rhubarb; but then it is less efficacious than when it proves purgative without addition. The use of it, however, in small doses, is by no means safe; as it frequently produces giddiness, dimness of sight, convulsions, &c. The addition of a purgative, indeed, prevents these effects; but at the same time, as already observed, it diminishes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of the medicine. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> therefore recommends large doses, as from them he never knew any other effect than the medicine's proving emetic or violently cathartic. The dose is from 12 to 60 or 70 grains of the root in substance, or two, three, or four drams of the infusion, twice a day. This medicine has also had its day, and is now very far from being considered as a specific.\n\nThe long round worms seem to be the most dangerous which infest the human body, as they often pierce through the stomach and intestines, and thus bring on a miserable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. The common symptoms of them are nausea, vomiting, looseness, fainting, slender intermittent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a>, itching of the nose, and epileptic fits. By the consumption of the chyle they produce <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a>, paleness, weakness, coliciveness, tumor of the abdomen, eructations, and rumbling of the intestines; but it is from the perforation of the intestines that the disease proves so frequently fatal. A child may be known to have worms from his cold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPERAMENT\">temperament</a>, paleness of the countenance, livid eyelids, hollow eyes, itching of the nose, voracity, startings, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>, in sleep; and more especially by a very fetid breath. Very frequently, however, they are voided by the mouth and anus, in which case there is no room for doubt. In the Medical Commentaries, vol. ii., we have an account of the intestines being perforated by a worm, and yet the patient recovered. The patient was a woman troubled with an inflammation in the lower part of the abdomen. The pain was so violent, that for six days she slept none at all; the tumor then broke, discharged upwards of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> of thin watery faeces, immediately after which the excrements followed. The next day she was extremely low; her pulse could scarcely be felt; the extremities were cold; and there was a considerable discharge from the wound, which had already begun to mortify. She got a decoction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CINCHONA\">cinchona</a> with wine, which alleviated the symptoms; but in removing the mortified parts a worm was found among them nine inches long, and as thick as an eagle's quill. By proper applications, the discharge of excrements ceased, and she recovered perfect health. She was sensible of no accident giving rise to the\nAppendix.","sp":71,"ep":75}]
