But we may safely venture to assert, that even from many enlightened governments it has hitherto claimed much less attention than its importance merits. At the British universities this has been too much the case. It is indeed true, that for near 20 years a few lectures on this subject have been delivered at the university of Edinburgh, by the professor of the institutions of medicine. But he could by no means consider the subject on that extensive scale which its importance merited. And he had often expressed his regret, that, as in several of the foreign universities, a professorship had not been instituted for the express purpose of giving a course of lectures on medical jurisprudence. That defect, however, in medical education at Edinburgh is now supplied. When that able and upright statesman Lord Grenville, to whom every thing that regarded the laws of his country was an object of peculiar attention, was at the head of his majesty's councils, a regius professorship of juridical and political medicine was established in the university of Edinburgh by a royal warrant.\nAppendix.","sp":82,"ep":83},{"h":"MEDICAL POLICE","t":"Of incomparably greater consequence, and more widely extended influence, is the second division of this subject. It regards not merely the welfare of individuals, but the prosperity and security of nations. It is perhaps the most important branch of general police; for its influence is not confined to those whom accidental circumstances bring within its sphere, but extends over the whole population of the state.\nMany of its principles have been long acknowledged, and considered as necessary consequences of medical and political truths; and some few of them have acquired the authority of laws. But it was reserved for the philanthropic Frank, to collect the whole into one vast and beneficent system, and to separate it from juridical medicine; in the old systems of which, it was neglected, or mentioned only in a few short paragraphs. His enlarged mind perceived at once, and fully vindicated its importance. The very name of Medical Police, is now sufficient to attract the attention of legislators and of magistrates, and to make them desirous of becoming acquainted with its principles, and anxious to see them carried into execution. In fact, its influence is already visible in the countries where it is cultivated. If the principles of medical police were separated from the professional part of medicine, and communicated in a form generally intelligible, in what country have we reason to expect more beneficial effects from its influence than this? Where is the spirit of patriotism and benevolence so prevalent? What nation is more generous in its public institutions? Where does the individual sacrifice a part of his wealth so willingly for the benefit of the community? It seems only necessary to prove that an undertaking will be of advantage to the state, to have it carried into instant execution. But, can medical knowledge be more usefully employed than in pointing out the means of preserving or improving health; of supplying healthy nourishment to the poor, especially in times of scarcity; of opposing the introduction of contagious diseases, and of checking their progress; of securing to the indigent the advantages intended by their benefactors; of rearing the orphan to be the support of the nation which has adopted him; and of diminishing the horrors of confinement to the poor maniac and the criminal? These good effects are not to be promoted so much by rigid laws, as by recommendation and example. Nor can it be reasonably objected to a system of medical police, that it is a pleasing dream, which flatters the imagination, but the execution of which is in reality impracticable. As well might we entirely throw aside the rules of humanity, because no one is able to observe them all; or live without laws, because no existing code is unexceptionable.\n\nMedical police may be defined,\u2014The application of the principles deduced from the different branches of medical knowledge, for the promotion, preservation and restoration of general health.\n\nThe effects to be expected from it are the general welfare of the state, and increase of healthy population; and are to be attained by means of public institutions, express laws, and popular instruction. Instructing the people, and convincing them of the propriety of certain precautions and attentions, in regard to their own and the general state of health, are necessary to secure the good effects of our public institutions and regulations; to obtain respect and obedience in many things, to which no express law can be adapted; and, to induce them to forego what may be prejudicial to the safety of the community, and of themselves.\n\nPublic medical institutions and laws, must be adapted to the country for which they are intended. Many local circumstances, national character, habits of life, prevalent customs and professions, situation, climate, &c, make considerable varieties necessary. And many institutions, many a law which would be highly beneficial to the public health, in some circumstances, would be useless, impracticable, and even hurtful, in others. These causes and their effects, must, therefore, be particularly attended to.\n\nThe principal authors who have written on this subject, are Alberti, Heister, Plaz, Frank, Huffly, Metzger, and Hebenstreit; to whom we may add Howard and Rumford.\n\nThe subjects which it comprehends, cannot be classified very regularly or systematically.

Aged.\nObservations on the Means of preserving Health.\n\nHaving now treated of all the most important diseases to which the human body is subjected, we shall conclude the article MEDICINE, with a few observations on the means of preserving health, both for the general management of valetudinarians, and of those also who wish to obtain long life and good health by avoiding the causes of those diseases which the human species often bring upon themselves. On this subject much has been written at almost every period of medicine. And we may refer those readers who wish for a full and extensive view of this interesting subject to a very elaborate work lately published by Sir John Sinclair Bart., entitled the Code of Health and Longevity. Here we cannot propose to give even an abridged view of this extensive inquiry; but must content ourselves with offering only a very few general observations.\n\nI. Rules for the Management of Valetudinarians.\n\nThat part of the medical system which lays down rules for the preservation of health, and prevention of diseases, termed Hygiene, is not to be strictly understood as if it respected only those people who enjoy perfect health, and who are under no apprehensions of disease, for such seldom either desire or attend to medical advice; but is rather considered as relating to valetudinarians, or such as, though not actually sick, may yet have sufficient reason to fear that they will soon become so; hence it is that the rules must be applied to correct morbid dispositions, and to obviate various particulars which were shown to be the remote or possible causes of diseases.\n\nFrom the way in which the several temperaments are commonly mentioned by systematic writers, it should seem as if they meant that every particular constitution might be referred to one or other of the four; but this is far from being the case, since by much the greater number of people have temperaments so indifferently marked, that it is hard to say to which of the temperaments they belong.\n\nWhen we actually meet with particular persons who have evidently either,\n\n1. Too much strength and rigidity of fibre, and too much sensibility;\n2. Too little strength, and yet too much sensibility;\n3. Too much strength, and but little sensibility; or,\n4. But little sensibility joined to weakness;\n\nwe should look on such persons as more or less in the valetudinary state, who require that these morbid dispositions be particularly watched, lest they fall into those diseases which are connected with the different temperaments.\n\nPeople of the first mentioned temperament being liable to suffer from continued fevers, especially of the inflammatory species, their scheme of preserving health should consist in temperate living, with respect both to diet and exercise; they should studiously avoid immoderate drinking, and be remarkably cautious lest any of the natural discharges be checked. People of this habit bear evacuations well, especially bleeding; they ought not, however, to lose blood but when they really require to have the quantity lessened; because too much of this evacuation would be apt to reduce the constitution to the second-mentioned temperament, in which strength is deficient, but sensibility redundant.\n\nPersons of the second temperament are remarkably prone to suffer from painful and spasmodic diseases, and are easily ruffled; and those of the softer sex who have this delicacy of habit, are very much disposed to hysterical complaints. The scheme here should be, to strengthen the solids by moderate exercise, cold bathing, cinchona, and chalybeate waters; particular attention should constantly be had to the state of the digestive organs, to prevent them from being overloaded with any species of food which might engender flatus, or irritate the sensitive membranes of the stomach and intestines, from whence the disorder would soon be communicated to the whole nervous system. Persons of this constitution should never take any of the drastic purges, or strong emetics; neither should they lose blood but in cases of urgent necessity. But a principal share of management, in these extremely irritable constitutions, consists in avoiding all sudden changes of every sort, especially those with respect to diet and clothing, and in keeping the mind as much as possible in a state of tranquillity; hence the great advantages which people of this frame derive from the use of medicinal waters drunk on the spot, on account of that freedom from care and serious business of every kind, which generally obtains in all the places planned for the reception of valetudinarians.\n\nThe third-mentioned temperament, where there is an excess of strength and but little sensibility, does not seem remarkably prone to any distressing or dangerous species of disease; and therefore it can hardly be supposed that persons so circumstanced will either of themselves think of any particular scheme of management, or have recourse to the faculty for their infirmities; such constitutions, however, we may observe, bear all kinds of evacuations well, and sometimes require them to prevent an over-fullness, which might end in an oppression of the brain or some other organ of importance.\n\nBut the fourth temperament, where we have weakness joined to want of sensibility, is exceedingly apt to fall into tedious and dangerous diseases, arising from a defect of absorbent power in the proper sets of vessels, and from languor of the circulation in general; whence corpulency, dropsy, jaundice, and different degrees of scrofulous affection. In order to prevent these, or any other species of accumulation and deprivation of the animal fluids, the people of this constitution should use a generous course of diet, with brisk exercise,\nMeans of exercise, and be careful that none of the secretions be\npreventing interrupted, nor any of the natural discharges sup-\npressed. These constitutions bear purging well, and often require it; as also the use of emetics, which are frequently found necessary to supply the place of exercise, by agitating the abdominal viscera, and are of service to prevent the stagnation of bile, or the accumulation of mucous humours, which hinder digestion, and clog the first passages. The free use of mustard, horseradish, and the like sort of stimulating dietetics, is serviceable in these torpid habits.\n\nWhen the general mass of fluids is increased beyond what is conducive to the perfection of health, there arises what the writers term a plethora, which may prove the source of different diseases; and therefore, when this overfulness begins to produce languor and oppression, care should be taken in time to reduce the body to a proper standard, by abridging the food and increasing the natural discharges, using more exercise, and indulging less in sleep.\n\nBut in opposite circumstances, where the fluids have been exhausted, we are to attempt the prevention of further waste by the use of strengthening stomachics, nourishing diet, and indulgence from fatigue of body or mind.\n\nVitiated fluids are to be considered as tainted either with the different kinds of general acrimony, or as betraying signs of some of the species of morbid matter which give rise to particular diseases, such as calculus, scurvy, &c.\n\nDuring the state of infancy, we may sometimes observe a remarkable acidity, which not only shows itself in the first passages, but also seems to contaminate the general mass of fluids. As it takes its rise, however, from weak bowels, our views, when we mean to prevent the ill consequences, must be chiefly directed to strengthen the digestive organs, as on their soundness the preparation of good chyle depends; and hence small doses of rhubarb and chalybeates (either the natural chalybeate waters mixed with milk, or the murias ammonia et ferrri in doses of a few grains, according to the age of the child), are to be administered; and the diet is to be so regulated as not to add to this acid tendency: brisk exercise is likewise to be enjoined, with frictions on the stomach, belly, and lower extremities.\n\nWhere the fluids tend to the putrefactive state, which shows itself by fetid breath, sponginess and bleeding of the gums, a bloated look and livid cast, the diet then should be chiefly of fresh vegetables and ripe fruits, with wine in moderation, due exercise, and strengthening bitters.\n\nWhere acrimony shows itself by itching eruptions, uncommon thirst, and flushing heats, nothing will answer better than such sulphureous waters as the Harrowgate and Moffat, at the same time using a course of diet that shall be neither acrid nor heating.\n\nSo far with respect to those kinds of morbid matter which do not invariably produce a particular species of disease: but there are others of a specific nature, some of which are generated in the body spontaneously, and seem to arise from errors in diet, or other circumstances of ill management with respect to the animal economy; and hence it is sometimes possible, to a certain degree if not altogether, to prevent the ill con-\n\nsequences. Thus, there are instances where returns of the gout have been prevented by adhering strictly to a milk diet.\n\nThe rheumatism has also been sometimes warded off by wearing a flannel shirt, or by using the cold bath without interruption.\n\nCalculus may be retarded in its progress, and prevented from creating much distress, by the internal use of soap and lime-water, by soap less taken in milk or in veal-broth, or by the use of aerated alkaline water, which may perhaps be considered as being both more safe and more efficacious, and at the same time more pleasant, than any of the other practices.\n\nThe scurvy may be prevented by warm clothing and perseverance in brisk exercise, by drinking wine or cider, and eating freely of such vegetable substances as can be had in these situations where this disease is most apt to show itself.\n\nIn constitutions where there is an hereditary disposition to the scrophula, if early precautions be taken to strengthen the solids by cold bathing, a nourishing course of diet, and moderate use of wine, the constitution which gives rise to the disease will probably be prevented from producing any very bad effects.\n\nThe other kinds of morbid matter, which are of the specific nature, are received into the body by infection or contagion.\n\nThe infection of a putrid fever or dysentery is best prevented by immediately taking an emetic on the first attack of the sickness or shivering; and if that do not completely answer, let a large blister be applied between the shoulders: by this method the nurses and other attendants on the sick in the naval hospitals have often been preserved. As to other infectious morbid matter, we must refer to what has already been said when treating of hydrophobia, poisons, gonorrhoea, &c.\n\nThe ill effects which may arise from the different species of salivary, are to be obviated, in general, by the prudent administration of emetics, and carefully abstaining from such kinds of food as are known to cause the accumulation of noxious matters in the first passages.\n\nCrude vegetables, milk, butter, and other oily substances, are to be avoided by persons troubled with a fowling in the stomach; brisk exercise, especially riding, is to be used, and they are to refrain from fermented liquors: the common drink should be pure water; or water with a very little of some ardent spirit, such as rum or brandy. Seltzer and Pyrmont waters are to be drunk medicinally; and aromatic bitters, infusions, or tinctures, acidulated with sulphuric acid, will be found serviceable, in order to strengthen the fibres of the stomach, and promote the expulsion of its contents, thereby preventing the too hasty fermentation of the alimentary mixture. In order to procure immediate relief, magnesia alba, or creta preparata, will seldom fail; the magnesia, as well as the chalk, may be made into lozenges, with a little sugar and mucilage; and in that form may be carried about and taken occasionally by people afflicted with the acid salivary.\n\nIn constitutions where there is an exuberance or stagnation of bile, and a troublesome bitterness in the mouth, it is necessary to keep the bowels always free, by taking occasionally small doses of pure aloes, olym ricini.\nAppendix.\n\nM E D I C I N E.\n\nMeans of preserving Health.\n\nWhen there is a tendency to the empyreumatic and rancid fuburra, people should carefully avoid all the various kinds of those oily and high-seasoned articles of diet generally termed made-dishes, and eat sparingly of plain meat, without rich sauces or much gravy; and in these cases the most proper drink is pure water.\n\nII. Rules for those who enjoy perfect Health.\n\nThere can be no doubt, that, in general, temperance is the true foundation of health; and yet the ancient physicians, as we may see in the rules laid down by Celsus, did not scruple to recommend indulgence now and then, and allowed people to exceed both in eating and drinking: but it is safer to proceed to excess in drink than in meat; and if the debauch should create any extraordinary or distressing degree of pain or sickness, and a temporary fever should ensue, there are two ways of shaking it off, either to lie in bed and encourage perspiration, or to get on horse-back and by brisk exercise restore the body to its natural state. The choice of these two methods must always be determined by the peculiar circumstances of the parties concerned, and from the experience which they may before have had which agrees best with them.\n\nIf a person should commit excess in eating, especially of high-seasoned things, with rich sauces, a draught of cold water, acidulated with sulphuric acid, will take off the sense of weight at the stomach, and assist digestion by moderating and keeping within bounds the alimentary fermentation, and thus preventing the generation of too much flatus. The luxury of ices may be here of real service at the tables of the great, as producing similar effects with the cold water acidulated. Persons in these circumstances ought not to lay themselves down to sleep, but should keep up and use gentle exercise until they are sensible that the stomach is unloaded, and that they no longer feel any oppressive weight about the praecordia.\n\nIf a man be obliged to fast, he ought, if possible, during that time, to avoid laborious work: after suffering severe hunger, people ought not at once to gorge and fill themselves; nor is it proper, after being overfilled, to enjoy an absolute fast: neither is it safe to indulge in a state of total rest immediately after excessive labour, nor suddenly fall hard to work after having been long without motion: in a word, all changes should be made by gentle degrees; for though the constitution of the human body be such that it can bear many alterations and irregularities without much danger, yet, when the transitions are extremely sudden, there is a great risk of producing some degree of disorder.\n\nIt is also the advice of Celsus to vary the scenes of life, and not confine ourselves to any settled rules: but as inaction renders the body weak and listless, and exercise gives vigour and strength, people should never long omit riding, walking, or going abroad in a carriage. Fencing, playing at tennis, dancing, or other similar engagements, which afford both exercise and amusement, as each shall be found most agreeable or convenient, are to be used in turn, according to the circumstances and tendency to any particular species of disease. But when the weaknesses of old age shall have rendered the body incapable of all these, then dry frictions with the flesh-brush will be very requisite to preserve health, by accelerating the flow of humours through the smallest orders of vessels, and preventing the fluids from stagnating too long in the cellular interstices of the fleshy parts.\n\nSleep is the great restorer of strength; for, during this time, the nutritious particles appear to be chiefly applied to repair the waste, and replace those that have been abraded and washed off by the labour and exercise of the day; but too much indulgence in sleep has many inconveniences, both with respect to body and mind, as it blunts the senses, and encourages the fluids to stagnate in the cellular membrane; whence corpulency, and its necessary consequences languor and weakness.\n\nThe proper time for sleep is the night, when darkness and silence naturally bring it on: sleep in the daytime, from noise and other circumstances, is in general not so found or refreshing; and to some people is really distasteful, as creating an unusual giddiness and languor, especially in persons addicted to literary pursuits. Custom, however, frequently renders sleep in the day necessary; and in those constitutions where it is found to give real refreshment, the propensity to it ought to be indulged, particularly in very advanced age.\n\nWith regard to the general regimen of diet, it has always been held as a rule, that the softer and milder kinds of aliment are most proper for children and younger subjects: that grown persons should eat what is more substantial; and old people lessen their quantity of solid food, and increase that of their drink both of the diluent and cordial kind.","sp":83,"ep":87},{"h":"MEDICI","t":"LORENZO DE, filled, with great propriety, the Magnificent, was the grandson of Cosmo, and about 16 years of age at his decease. In 1469 his father died, and he succeeded to his authority as if it had constituted a part of his fortune. In the year 1474, Lorenzo incurred the displeasure of the pope for the opposition he\nhe made to some of his encroachments on the petty princes of Italy, and for this reason he deprived him of the office of treasurer of the Roman see, which he conferred on one Pazzi, connected with a Florentine family, the interest of which he thus secured, and intended to sacrifice Lorenzo and Giuliano to his private revenge. Their assassination was fixed for Sunday, April 26, 1478, and the cathedral was the place in which a monitor of an archbishop had resolved to murder them by the instigation of the pope. When the people saw one of their favourites (Giuliano) expiring, and the other (Lorenzo) covered with blood, their rage was not to be expressed in language. The interference of the magistrates was finally victorious, who had the courage and virtue to hang the archbishop from one of the windows, arrayed in his pontifical robes, which made Florence resound with the acclamation\u2014Medici! Medic! down with their enemies!\n\nLorenzo was delivered from that part of the cathedral to which he had fled for refuge, and was triumphantly carried home, where his wounds were attended to by men of ability. His friends in the meantime pursued the conspirators, and spared none who happened to fall in their way. In a word, the generality of them were either hanged or decapitated, and very few had the good fortune to escape their uncommon vigilance. Much to the honour of Lorenzo, he exerted all his influence to prevent the indiscriminate massacre of his cruel enemies, and restrain the just indignation of the people, begging that they would trust the magistrates with the punishment of the guilty; and the respect in which he was held had the most astonishing effect in restraining the vengeance of popular indignation.\n\nNo sooner had hostilities ceased between Pope Sixtus and the Florentine republic, then Lorenzo began to develop plans for securing the internal peace and tranquillity of Italy, by which the highest honour has been conferred on his political life. But the life of this great man was again brought into imminent danger by the intrigues of Cardinal Riaro, and some Florentine exiles, who determined to assassinate him in the church of the Carmelites, on the festival of the Ascension 1481; but the plot was happily discovered, the conspirators were executed, and after this Lorenzo very seldom went abroad without being surrounded by a number of friends in whom he could securely confide.\n\nWhen we attentively examine the character of Lorenzo, it will not perhaps appear astonishing, that Italy, Christendom, and even the Mahometans themselves, conferred upon him the most flattering approbation. Even Prince Mirandola chose Florence as the place of his residence entirely upon his account, and there ended his mortal career. To a most engaging person Lorenzo added almost every other accomplishment. He was the favourite of the ladies, the envy of his own sex, and the admiration of all. He was declared to be unrivalled in chivalry, and one of the most eminent orators that the world in any age has produced. According to the opinion of his contemporaries, he was even superior to Julius Caesar himself, except as a general, yet he would also have proved a most consummate commander had not peace been always the darling of his soul. We recollect a memorable passage in the Rambler, which may here be appropriately introduced. A great man condescending to do little things, is like the Medicis. Fun in his western declination; he remits his splendor, but retains his magnitude, and pleases more though he dazzles less. To such little things did Lorenzo frequently submit, often seeking pleasure in his nursery, and spending hours there in all the frivolous pranks of childish diversion. The gravity of his life, if contrasted with its levity, must make him appear as a composition of two different persons, incompatible, and, as it were, impossible to be joined the one with the other.\n\nSuch were the love and veneration of the citizens for Lorenzo, that the physician who attended him on his deathbed, terrified to return to Florence, left the house in a state of distraction, and plunged himself into a well. When Ferdinand king of Naples was informed of his death, he cried out, \"This man has lived long enough for his own glory, but too short a time for Italy.\" He died on the 8th of April 1492, amidst a number of his weeping friends, who appeared deeply conscious of such an irreparable loss.\n\nMedicis, John de, on account of his bravery and knowledge in military affairs, was surnamed the Invincible. He was the son of John, otherwise called Fourdun, de Medicis. His only son Cosmo I. styled the Great, was chosen duke of Florence after the murder of Alexander de Medicis, A.D. 1537. He first carried arms under Laurence de Medicis against the duke of Urbino, afterwards under Pope Leo X. Upon the death of Leo, he entered into the service of Francis I., which he quitted to follow the fortune of Francis Sforza duke of Milan. When Francis I. formed an alliance with the pope and the Venetians against the emperor, he returned to his service. He was wounded in the knee at Governola, a small town in the Mantuan territory, by a musket ball; and being carried to Mantua, he died the 29th of November 1526, aged 28. Brantome relates, that when his leg was to be cut off, and when he was informed that he needed some person to support him, \"Proceed without fear (said he), I need nobody!\" and he held the candle himself during the operation. This anecdote is also mentioned by Varchi. John de Medicis was above the middle stature, strong, and nervous. His soldiers, to express their affection for him and their concern for his loss, assumed a mourning dress and standards, which gave the name of the black band to the Tuscan troops whom he commanded.\n\nMedicis, Laurence, or Laurencius de, was descended from a brother of Cosmo the Great, and affected the name of popular. In 1537, he killed Alexander de Medicis, whom Charles V. had made duke of Florence, and who was believed to be the natural son of Laurence de Medicis duke of Urbino. He was jealous of Alexander's power, and disguised this jealousy under the specious pretext of love to his country. He loved men of learning, and cultivated literature. His works are, 1. Lamenti, Modena, 12mo. 2. Acidoso Commedia, Florence 1595, 12mo. He died without issue.\n\nMedicis, Hypolitus de, natural son of Julian de Medicis and a lady of Urbino, was early remarkable for the brilliancy of his wit and the graces of his person. Pope Clement VII. his cousin, made him cardinal in 1529, and sent him as legate into Germany to the court of Charles V. When that prince went into Italy, Medicis, yielding to his warlike disposition, appeared.\nMedici appeared in the dress of an officer, and advanced before the emperor, followed by several respectable gentlemen of the court. Charles, naturally suspicious, and afraid that the legate intended to do him some ill offices with the pope, sent after him and caused him to be apprehended. But when he understood that it was a mere fallacy of humour in the young cardinal, he set him at liberty in a few days. The character which Medici obtained by the happy success of this appointment was of essential service to him. He was considered as one of the supports of the Holy See; and a little before Clement's death, when the corsair Barbarossa made a descent into Italy to the great terror of Rome, which was only defended by 200 of the pope's guards, Medici was despatched to protect the coasts from the fury of the barbarians. On his arrival at the place of destination, he was fortunate enough to find that Barbarossa had withdrawn himself at that critical moment; which allowed him to claim the honour of the retreat without exposing his person or his army. When he returned to Rome, he was of great service in the election of Paul III., who nevertheless refused to make him legate to Ancona, though that office had been promised to him in the conclave. Enraged also that the pope had bestowed the principality of Florence on Alexander de Medici, supposed to be the natural son of Laurence duke of Urbino, he was prompted by his ambition to believe that he might succeed to that dignity by the destruction of Alexander. He entered into a conspiracy against him, and determined to carry him off by a mine; but the plot was discovered before he had accomplished his purpose. Octavian Zanga, one of his guards, was arrested as his chief accomplice. Hyppolitus de Medici, apprehensive for his own safety, retired to a castle near Tivoli. On his road to Naples, he fell sick at Itri in the territory of Fondi, and died August 13, 1535, in his 24th year, not without suspicion of being poisoned. His house was an asylum for the unfortunate, and frequently for those who were guilty of the blackest crimes. It was open to men of all nations; and he was frequently addressed in twenty different languages. He had a natural son named Andrea de Medici, who was a knight of Malta. This anecdote proves that his manners were more military than ecclesiastic. He wore a sword, and never put on the habit of cardinal except on occasions of public ceremony. He was wholly devoted to the theatre, hunting, and poetry.\n\nMedici, Alexander de, first duke of Florence in 1539, was natural son of Laurence de Medici, further named the Younger, and nephew of Pope Clement VII. He owed his elevation to the intrigues of his uncle and to the arms of Charles V. This prince having made himself master of Florence after an obstinate siege, conferred the sovereignty of this city on Alexander, and afterwards gave him in marriage Margaret of Austria his natural daughter. According to the terms of capitulation granted to the Florentines, the new duke was to be only hereditary doge, and his authority was tempered by councils, which left them at least a shadow of their ancient liberty. But Alexander, who felt himself supported by the emperor and the pope, was no sooner in possession of his new dignity, than he began to govern like a tyrant; being guided by no law but his own caprice, indulging the most brutal passions, and making light of discouraging families, and of violating even the asylum of the cloisters to gratify his lust. Among the confidants of his debauchery was a relation of his own, Laurence de Medici. This young man, who was only 22 years of age, at the instigation of Philip Strozzi, a zealous republican, conceived the design of assassinating Alexander, and thereby of delivering his country from oppression. From the moment when he first became attached to him, he tried to gain his confidence, for no other reason but that he might the better have it in his power to take away his life. A considerable time elapsed before he found such an opportunity as he desired. At length, under pretence of procuring the duke a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with a lady of whom he was deeply enamoured, he brought him alone and unattended into his chamber, and put him under his bed. He went out, under pretence of introducing the object of his passion; and returned along with an assassin by profession, to whom alone he had entrusted his design, only to stab him. This cruel scene happened on the night betwixt the 5th and 6th of January 1537. Alexander was only 26 years of age. The Florentines derived no advantage from this crime of Laurence, for they failed in their attempt to recover their liberty. The party of the Medici prevailed, and Alexander was succeeded by Cosmo; whose government, it must be confessed, was as just and moderate, as that of his predecessor had been violent and tyrannical. Laurence de Medici fled to Venice, to some of the leaders of the malecontents at Florence, who had taken refuge there; but not thinking himself in sufficient security, he went to Constantinople, whence he returned sometime after to Venice. He was there assassinated in 1547, ten years after the duke's murder, by two soldiers, one of whom had formerly been in Alexander's guards: And these soldiers were generous enough to refuse a considerable sum of money, which was the price put upon his head.\n\nMedici, Cosmo de, grand duke of Tuscany, joined Charles V. against the French, after trying in vain to continue neutral. As a reward for his services, the emperor added to the duchy of Tuscany Piombino, the isle of Elba, and other states. Cosmo soon after received from Pope Pius IV. the title of grand duke; and had it not been opposed by all the princes of Italy, this pontiff, who was entirely devoted to Cosmo, because he had thought proper to acknowledge him to be of his house, would have conferred on him the title of king. There never was a more zealous patron of learning. Ambitious of imitating the second C\u00e6sar, he like him, was fond of learned men, kept them near his person, and founded for them the university of Pisa. He died in 1574, at the age of 55, after governing with equal wisdom and glory. In 1562 he instituted the military order of St. Stephen. His son, Francis Mary who died in 1587, was the father of Mary of Medici, the wife of Henry the Great and of Ferdinand I., who died in 1608.\n\nMedietas linguae, in Law, signifies a jury, or inquest impanelled, of which the one half are natives of this land and the other foreigners.

The inflammation; so that in all probability it arose entirely from the worm itself.\n\nThe *t\u00e6nia*, or *tape worm* as it is called, is one of those most difficult to be removed from the human body. It is of two kinds, *t\u00e6nia folium* and *t\u00e6nia lata*; for a description of which see the article *T\u00c6NIA*. The reason of its being so difficult to cure is, that though portions of it are apt to break off and be discharged, it is endowed with a power of reproduction, so that the patient is little or nothing better. The symptoms occasioned by it are not different from those above described. A specific against the *t\u00e6nia lata* has been lately so much celebrated in France, that the king thought proper to purchase it from the proprietor (Madame Nouffer), and the account of it has been translated into English by Dr Simmons. The patients are required to observe no particular regimen till the day before they take the specific. That day they are to take nothing after dinner till about 7 o'clock; after which, they are to take the following soup: \"Take a pint and an half of water, two or three ounces of good fresh butter, and two ounces of bread cut into thin slices; add to this salt enough to season it, and then boil it to the consistence of panada.\" About a quarter of an hour after this, they take a biscuit and a glass of white wine, either pure or mixed with water; or even water alone, if they have not been accustomed to wine. If the patient has not been to stool that day, (which, however, is not usual with patients in this way), the following clyster is to be injected. \"Take a small quantity of the leaves of mallows, and boil them in a sufficient quantity of water, mixing with it a little salt, and when strained off add two ounces of olive oil.\" Next morning, about eight or nine hours after the supper above mentioned, the specific is to be taken. This is no other than two or three drams of the root of male fern, *polypodium filix mas* of Linnaeus, gathered in autumn, and reduced to fine powder. It is to be taken in any distilled water, or in common water. This medicine is apt to occasion a nausea; to avoid which, Madame Nouffer allows her patients to chew anything that is agreeable, but forbids anything to be swallowed; or they may smell to vinegar, to check the sickness; but if notwithstanding this, the specific be thrown up, a fresh dose must be swallowed as soon as the sickness is gone off, and then they must try to sleep. About two hours after this the following bolus is to be taken. \"Take of the pavacea of mercury 14 times sublimed, and select resin of scammony, each ten grains: of fresh and good gamboge six or seven grains: reduce each of these substances separately into powder, and then mix them with some conserve into a bolus.\" This composition is to be swallowed at two different times, washing it down with one or two dithers of weak green-tea, after which the patient must walk about his chamber. When the bolus begins to operate, he is to take a dish of the same tea occasionally, until the worm be expelled; then, and not before, Madame Nouffer gives him broth or soup, and he is directed to dine as is usual after taking physic. After dinner he may either lie down or walk out, taking care to conduct himself discreetly, to eat but little supper, and to avoid everything that is not of easy digestion.\n\nThe cure then is complete; but it is not always effected with the same quickness in every subject. He who has not kept down the whole bolus, or who is not sufficiently purged by it, ought to take, four hours after it, from two to eight drams of Epsom salt dissolved in boiling water. The dose of this salt may be varied according to the temperament and other circumstances of the patient.\n\nIf the worm should not come away in a bundle, but in the form of a thread (which particularly happens when the worm is involved in much tenacious mucus), the patient must continue to sit upon the close stool without attempting to draw it away, drinking at the same time warm weak tea; sometimes this alone is not sufficient, and the patient is obliged to take another dose of purging salt, but without varying his position till the worm be wholly expelled.\n\nIt is unusual for patients who have kept down both the specific and purging dose, not to discharge the worm before dinner-time. This, however, sometimes happens when the dead worm remains in large bundles in the intestines, so that the faeces becoming more limpid towards the end of the purging, pass by it without drawing it with them. The patient may in this case eat his dinner; and it has been observed, that the food, joined to the use of a clyster, has brought about the expulsion of the worm.\n\nSometimes the worm is brought away by the action of the specific alone, before the patient has taken the purging bolus: when this happens, Madame Nouffer gives only two thirds of it, or substitutes the salt in its stead.\n\nPatients must not be alarmed by any sensation of heat or uneasiness they may feel during the action of the remedy, either before or after a copious evacuation, or just as they are about to void the worm. These sensations are transitory, and go off spontaneously, or by the affluence of the vapour of vinegar drawn in at the nose.\n\nThey who have vomited both the specific and bolus, or who have kept down only a part of them, sometimes do not void the worm that day. Madame Nouffer therefore directs them to take again that night the soup, the wine and biscuit; and if circumstances require it, the clyster. If the worm do not come away during the night, she gives them early the next morning another dose of the specific, and, two hours afterwards, fix drams or an ounce of purging salt, repeating the whole process of the preceding day; excepting the bolus, which she suppresses.\n\nShe observes, that very hot weather diminishes in some degree the action of her remedy; she therefore prefers the month of September for administering it; but as she has not been always able to choose the season, and has been sometimes obliged to undertake the cure of patients in the hottest days of summer, she then gave her specific very early in the morning; and with this precaution she saw no difference in its effects.\n\nOn the day appointed for the trial of this medicine before the commissioners nominated by the king of France, it was exhibited to five different persons; but only one of them was certainly known to have the *t\u00e6nia lata* by having discharged parts of it before. That person was cured; the second voided a portion of the *t\u00e6nia folium*; the third some *africoides*, with a part of the *t\u00e6nia folium*; the fourth and fifth voided no worms; but\nbut the last considered much of the viscid slime he voided to be worms in a dissolved state.\n\nThis trial was thought sufficient to ascertain the efficacy of the medicine, and further trials were made by those to whom the secret was communicated. The first voided two tenia, after much vomiting and 18 or 20 stools; the second had no vomiting, but was as violently purged, and discharged two worms; the third had 20 copious stools during the night, and discharged the worm in the morning; and the fifth was affected in much the same manner. Some others who were not relieved, were supposed not to have a tenia.\n\nThis specific, however, is not to be considered as a new discovery; the efficacy of fern in cases of tenia having been known long ago. Theophrastus prescribes its root, in doses of four drams, given in water sweetened with honey, as useful in expelling flat worms.\u2014Dioctorides orders it in the same dose, and adds, that its effects are more certain when it is mixed with four oboli (40 grains) of scammony or black hellebore; he particularly requires that garlic should be taken before hand. Pliny, Galen, Oribasius, and A\u00ebtius, ascribe this same virtue to fern; and are followed in this by Avicenna, and the other Arabian physicians. Dorotheus, Valerius Cordus, Dodonaeus, Matthiolus, Delechampius, who commented on Dioctorides, or copied him in many things, all mention the fern-root as a specific against the tenia. Sennertus, and Burnet after him, recommended in similar cases an infusion of this plant, or a dram of its powder, for young persons, and three drams for adults. Simon Paulus, quoted by Ray and Geoffroy, confides it as the most efficacious of all poisons against the flat worm, and as being the basis of all the secret remedies extolled by empirics in that defense. Andry prefers distilled fern-water to the root in powder, or he employs it only in the form of an opiate, or mixed with other substances.\n\nThese are not the only authors who have mentioned the tenia; many others have described this worm, the symptoms it excites, and the treatment proper to expel it. Almost all of them mention the fern-root, but at the same time they point out other remedies as possessing equal efficacy. Amongst these we find the bark of the root of the mulberry-tree, the juice of the auricula marus, the roots of chamaeleon niger, ginger, zedoary; decoctions of mugwort, southernwood, wormwood, penny-royal, origanum, hyssop, and in general all bitter and aromatic plants, &c. Some of them direct the specific to be simply mixed and taken in wine or honey and water; others join to it the use of some purgative remedy, which they say adds to its efficacy. Oribasius, Sylvius, &c. distinguish the specific that kills the worm, from the purgative that evacuates it, and direct them to be given at different times. Sennertus gives a very satisfactory reason for adopting this method. If we give, says he, the purgative medicine and the specific at the same time, the latter will be hastily carried off before it can have exerted its powers on the worm; whereas, if we give the specific first, and thus weaken the worm, it will collect itself into a bundle, and, being brought away by means of the purge, the patient will be cured. The cure will be more speedy if the prime vice have been previously lubricated. These precautions are all of them essential to the success of the remedy, nor are they neglected by Madame Nouffer in her method of treatment. The panada and injection she prefers the night before, to lubricate the intestines, and prepare the prime vice. The fern root, taken in the morning, kills and detaches the worm; of this the patients are sensible by the cessation of the pain in the stomach, and by the weight that is felt in the lower belly. The purgative bolus administered two hours after this, procures a complete evacuation; it is composed of substances that are at once purgative and vermifuge, and which, even when administered alone, by different physicians, sometimes succeeded in expelling the worm. If this purgative appear to be too strong, the reader is desired to recollect, that it produced no ill effects in either of the cases that came under the observation of the physicians appointed to make the trials; and that in one of those cases, by diminishing the dose, they evidently retarded the evacuations.\u2014Regard however, they observe, is to be had both to the age and the temperament of the patient, and the treatment should always be directed by a prudent and experienced physician, who may know how to vary the proportions of the dose as circumstances may require. If the purgative be not of sufficient strength, the worm, after being detached by the specific, remains too long a time in the intestines, and becoming soon corrupted, is brought away only in detached portions; on the other hand, if the purgative be too strong, it occasions too much irritation, and evacuations that cannot fail to be inconvenient.\n\nMadame Nouffer's long experience has taught her to distinguish all these circumstances with singular adroitness.\n\nThis method of cure is, as we have seen, copied in a great measure from the ancients; it may be possible to produce the same effects by varying the remedies; but the manner of applying them is by no means indifferent: we shall be always more certain of success, if the intestines be previously evacuated, and if the specific be given some time before the purgative bolus. It is to this method that Madame Nouffer's constant success is attributed.\n\nHer remedy has likewise some power over the tenia folium; but as the rings of this worm separate from each other more easily than those of the tenia lata, it is almost impossible for it to be expelled entire. It will be necessary therefore to repeat the treatment several times, till the patient cease to void any portions of worms. It must likewise be repeated, it, after the expulsion of one tenia folium, another should be generated in the intestinal canal. This last case is so rare, that it has been supposed that no person can have, more than one of these worms; and for this reason it has been named solitary worm, which, being once removed, could never be renewed or replaced by a second; but experience has proved, that this notion is an ill-founded prejudice; and we know that sometimes these worms succeed each other, and that sometimes several of them exist together. Two living teniae have frequently been expelled from the same patient. Dr De Haen relates an instance of a woman who voided 18 teniae at once. In these cases the symptoms are usually more alarming; and the appetite becomes excessive, because these worms derive all their nourishment from the chyle. If too austere and ill-judged a regimen deprives\nAppendix.\n\nWorms deprives them of this, they may be expected to attack even the membranes of the intestines themselves. This evil is to be avoided by eating frequently.\n\nSuch are the precautions indicated in this disease. The ordinary vermifuge remedies commonly procured only a palliative cure, perhaps because they were too often improperly administered. But the efficacy of the present remedy, in the opinion of the French physicians, seems to be sufficiently confirmed by experience. To the above account, however, it seems proper to subjoin the following observations by Dr Simmons.\n\n\"A Swiss physician, of the name of Herrenschwand, more than 20 years ago, acquired no little celebrity by distributing a composition of which he styled himself the inventor, and which was probably of the same nature as Madame Nouffer's. Several very eminent men, as Tronchin, Hovius, Bonnet, Cramer, and others, have written concerning the effects of this remedy. It seems that Dr Herrenschwand used to give a powder by way of preparation, the night before he administered his specific. Nothing could be said with certainty concerning the composition either of one or the other. The treatment was said sometimes to produce most violent effects, and to leave the patients in a valetudinary state. Dr De Haen was dissuaded by his friends from using it, because it disordered the patients too much. It will be readily conceived, now that we are acquainted with Madame Nouffer's method, that these effects were occasioned wholly by the purgative bolus. It is not strange, that resin of scammony or jalap, combined with mercurius dulcis and gamboge, all of them in strong doses, should in many subjects occasion the greatest disorders. It seems likely, however, that much of the success of the remedy depends on the use of a drastic purge. Some of the ancients who were acquainted with the virtues of the fern root, observed that its efficacy was increased by scammony. Refinuous purges, especially when combined with mercury, have often been given with success in cases of tenia. Dr De Haen saw a worm of this sort five ells long expelled by the resin of jalap alone. Dr Gaubius knew a woman who had taken a variety of anthelmintic remedies without any effect, though she had voided a portion of tenia an ell and a half long previous to the use of these medicines; but at length, after taking a purge of singular strength, she voided the worm entire. Many other instances of the same kind are to be met with in authors. Other remedies have occasionally been given with success. In Sweden, it has been a practice to drink several gallons of cold water, and then to take some drastic purge. Boerhaave says, that he himself saw a tenia measuring 300 ells expelled from a Russian by means of the sulphate of iron.\n\nFrom some late accounts, there is reason to believe that Dr Herrenschwand's remedy for tenia does not so exactly agree with that of Madame Nouffer as Dr Simmons seems to imagine. According to the account given us by a gentleman who had his information from Dr Herrenschwand himself, it consists entirely of gamboge and fixed vegetable alkali.\n\nOf Poisons.\n\nOf many poisons we have already treated, but there are some of which nothing has hitherto been said. Among the most fatal of these are the bites and stings of serpents, scorpions, &c. According to Dr Mead, the symptoms which follow the bite of a viper are, an acute pain in the place wounded, with a swelling, at first red, but afterwards livid, which by degrees spreads farther to the neighbouring parts; with great faintness, and a quick, low, and sometimes interrupted pulse; great sickness at stomach, with bilious convulsive vomitings, cold sweats, and sometimes pains about the navel. Frequently a foamy liquor runs from the small wound, and little pustules are raised about it: the colour of the whole skin in less than an hour is changed yellow, as if the patient had the jaundice. These symptoms are very frequently followed by death, especially if the climate be hot, and the animal of a large size. This is not, however, the case with all kinds of serpents. Some, we are assured, kill by a fatal sleep; others are said to produce an universal hemorrhage and diffusion of the blood; and others an unquenchable thirst. But of all the species of serpents hitherto known, there is none whose bite is more expeditiously fatal than that of the rattlesnake. Dr Mead tells us, that the bite of a large serpent of this kind killed a dog in a quarter of a minute; and to the human species they are almost equally fatal. Of this serpent it is said, that the bite makes the person's skin become spotted all over like the skin of the serpent; and that it has such a motion as if there were innumerable living serpents below it. But this is probably nothing more than a diffusion of the blood, by which the skin becomes spotted as in petechial fevers, at the same time that the muscles may be convulsed as in the distemper called hieroglyphos, which was formerly thought to be the effect of evil spirits; but it is even not improbable that observers have been somewhat aided by fancy and superstition when they thought that they detected such appearances.\n\nIt has justly appeared surprising to philosophers, how such an inconsiderable quantity of matter as the poison emitted by a viper at the time of biting should produce such violent effects. But all inquiries into this matter must necessarily be uncertain; neither can they contribute anything towards the cure. It is certain that the poison produces a gangrenous disposition of the part itself, and likewise seemingly of the rest of the body; and that the original quantity of poison continues some time before it exerts all its power on the patient, as it is known that removing part of the poisonous matter by suction will alleviate the symptoms. The indications of cure then are three: 1. To remove the poisonous matter from the body: Or, 2. If this cannot be done, to change its destructive nature by some powerful and penetrating application to the wound: And, 3. To counteract the effects of that portion already received into the system.\n\nThe poisonous matter can only be removed from the body by sucking the wound either by the mouth, or by means of a cupping glass; but the former is probably the more efficacious, as the saliva will in some measure dilute and perhaps obviate the poison. Dr Mead directs the person who sucks the wound to hold warm oil in his mouth, to prevent inflammation of the lips and tongue: but as bites of this kind are most likely to happen in the fields, and at a distance from houses, the want of oil ought by no means to retard\nthe operation, as the delay of a few minutes might prove of the most fatal consequence; and it appears from Dr Mead's experiments, that the taking the poison of a viper into the mouth undiluted, is attended with no worse consequences than that of raising a slight inflammation. A quick excision of the part might also be of very great service.\n\nThe only way of answering the second indication is, by destroying the poisoned part by a red-hot iron, or the application of alkaline salts, which have the power of immediately altering the texture of all animal substances to which they are applied, provided they are not covered by the skin; and as long as the poison is not totally absorbed into the system, these must certainly be of use.\n\nTo answer the third indication, Dr Mead recommends a vomit of ipecacuanha, encouraged in the working with oil and warm water. The good effects of this, he says, are owing to the shake which it gives to the nerves, whereby the irregular spasms into which their whole system might be drawn are prevented. After this the patient must go to bed, and a sweat must be procured by cordial medicines; by which the remaining effects of the poison will be carried off.\n\nIt has been confidently asserted by many, that the American Indians are possessed of some specific remedy by which they can easily cure the bite of a rattlesnake. But Mr Cateby, who must have had many opportunities of knowing this, positively denies that they have any such medicine. They make applications indeed, and sometimes the patient recovers; but these recoveries he ascribes to the strength of nature overcoming the poison, more than to the remedies made use of. He says, they are very acute in their prognostics whether a person that is bit will die or not; and when they happen to receive a bite in certain parts of the body, when the teeth of the animal enter a large vein, for instance, they quietly resign themselves to their fate, without attempting anything for their own relief. Indeed, so violent and quick is the operation of this poison, that unless the antidote be instantly applied, the person will die before he can get to a house. It would seem therefore eligible for those who are in danger of such bites, to carry along with them some strong alkaline ley, or dry alkaline salt, or both, which could be instantly clapt on the wound, and by its dissolving power would destroy both the poison and the infected parts. Strong cordials also, such as ardent spirits, volatile alkali, &c., might possibly excite the languid powers of nature, and enable her to expel the enemy, which would otherwise prove too powerful. This seems to be somewhat confirmed from the account we have in the Philosophical Transactions of a gentleman bit by a rattlesnake, who was more relieved by a poultice of vinegar and vine-ashes put to his wound than any thing else. The vine ashes being of an alkaline nature, must have saturated the vinegar, so that no part of the cure could be attributed to it; on the other hand, the ashes themselves could not have been saturated by the small quantity of acid necessary to form them into a poultice; of consequence they must have operated by their alkaline quality.\u2014Soap ley, therefore, or very strong salt of tartar, may reasonably be thought to be the best external applica-\n\ntion, not only for the bites of vipers, but of every venomous creature; and in fact we find dry salt universally recommended both in the bites of serpents and of mad dogs. Dr Mead recommends the fat of vipers immediately rubbed into the wound; but owns that it is not safe to trust to this remedy alone.\n\nSome years ago the volatile alkali was strongly recommended by M. Sage of the French academy, as a powerful remedy against the bite of the viper; and, by a letter from a gentleman in Bengal to Dr Wright, it would appear that this article, under the form of the eau de luce, which is very little if any thing different from the spiritus ammoniae succinatus of the London Pharmacopoeia, has been employed with very great success against this affection in the East Indies; but from the trials made with it by the abb\u00e9 Fontana, published in his Treatise on the Poison of the Viper, it would appear that it by no means answered his expectation; and the efficacy of this, as well as of the snake pills mentioned under the article HYDROPHOBIA, still requires to be confirmed by further experience.\n\nMEL\u00c6NE.\n\nThis is a distemper not very common, but it has been observed by the ancient physicians, and is described by Hippocrates under the name of morbus niger. It shows itself by a vomiting and purging of black tar-like matter, which Hippocrates, Boerhaave, and Van Swieten, supposed to be occasioned by atra bilis. But Dr Home, in his Clinical Experiments, endeavours to shew that it is owing to an effusion of blood from the mesenteric vessels, which, by its stagnation and corruption, assumes that strange appearance. The disease, he says, frequently follows hemorrhage; and those of a scorbutic habit are most subject to it. It is an acute disease, and terminates soon; yet it is not attended with any great degree of fever. In one of Dr Home's patients the crisis happened on the eighth day by diarrhoea; in another, on the 14th, by sweat and urine; and a third had no evident critical evacuation.\n\nAs to the cure, Dr Home observes, that bleeding is always necessary where the pulse can bear it; nor are we to be deterred from it by a little weakness of the pulse, more than in the enteritis. Emetics are hurtful, but purgatives are useful. But the most powerful medicine for checking this hemorrhage is the sulphuric acid; and, that this might be given in greater quantity, he mixed it with mucilage of gum arabic; by which means he was enabled to give double the quantity he could otherwise have done. The cold bath was tried in one instance, but he could not determine whether it was of any service or not. The cure was completed by exercise and cinchona.\n\nOf the DISEASES of CHILDREN.\n\nDr Buchan observes, that from the annual registers of the dead, it appears that about one half of the children born in Great Britain die under twelve years of age; and this very great mortality he attributes in a great measure to wrong management. The particulars of this wrong management enumerated by him are,\n\n1. Mothers not suckling their own children. This, he owns, it is sometimes impossible for them to do; but\nAppendix.\n\nDiseases but where it can be done, he affirms that it ought Children. never to be omitted. This, he says, would prevent the unnatural custom of mothers leaving their own children to suckle those of others; on which he passes a most severe censure, and indeed scarce any censure can be severe enough upon such inhumanity. Dr Buchan informs us, \"He is sure he speaks within bounds, when he says not one in a hundred of these children live who are thus abandoned by their mothers.\" For this reason he adds, that no mother should be allowed to suckle another's child till her own be fit to be weaned. A regulation of this kind would save many lives among the poorer sort, and would do no harm to the rich; as most women who make good nurses are able to suckle two children in succession upon the same milk.\n\n2. Another source of the diseases of children is the unhealthiness of parents; and our author insists that no person who labours under an incurable malady ought to marry.\n\n3. The manner of clothing children tends to produce diseases. All that is necessary here, he says, is to wrap the child in a soft loose covering; and the softness of every part of the infant's body sufficiently shows the injury which must necessarily ensue by pursuing a contrary method.\n\n4. A new-born infant, instead of being treated with syrups, oils, &c., ought to be allowed to suck the mother's milk almost as soon as it comes into the world. He condemns the practice of giving wines and spirituous liquors along with the food soon after birth; and says, that if the mother or nurse has a sufficient quantity of milk, the child will need little or no other food before the third or fourth month. But to this it may reasonably be objected, not only that the nursing would thus be very severe on the mother; but if the child be left thus long without other food, it will not easily relish that food for some time, and its stomach is apt to be easily hurt by a slight change of diet after it has been long accustomed to one thing. The human species are unquestionably fitted by nature for a mixed aliment, both from the vegetable and animal kingdom. And the analogy of other animals belonging to the class of mammalia for whom milk is equally provided at the earliest periods of life, would lead us to the conclusion, that mixed aliment is well fitted for the human species even in the earliest periods of infancy. The lamb is no sooner dropt than, by natural instinct, it crops the grass as well as it sucks its mother. And the stomach in the human species, immediately after birth, can digest other food as well as milk. Neither can it be shown, that the strongest and most healthy infants are those which get no other food but the mother's milk during the first months of their life. In fact, children are evidently of a weak and lax habit of body, so that many of their diseases must arise from that cause; all directions which indiscriminately advise an antiphilistic regimen for infants as soon as they come into the world, must of necessity be wrong. Many instances in fact might be brought to show, that by the profligaceous method of starving infants, and at the same time treating them with vomits and purges, they are often hurried out of the world. Animal food indeed, particularly under the form of broths, is excessively agreeable to children, and they ought to be indulged with it in moderation. This will prove a much better remedy for those acidities with which children are often troubled, than magnesia alba, crabs eyes, or other absorbents, which have the most pernicious effects on the stomachs of these tender creatures, and pall the appetite to a surprising degree. The natural appetites of children are indeed the best rule by which we can judge of what is proper or improper for them. They must no doubt be regulated as to the quantity; but we may be assured that what a child is very fond of will not hurt it, if taken in moderation. When children are sick, they refuse every thing but the breast; and if their distemper be very severe, they will refuse it also, and in this case they ought not to be precluded to take food of any kind; but when the sickness goes off, their appetite also returns, and they will require the usual quantity of food.\n\nAccording to Dr Armstrong, inward fits, as they are called, are in general the first complaint that appears in children; and as far as he has observed, most, if not all infants, during the first months, are more or less liable to them. The symptoms are these: The child appears as if it was asleep, only the eyelids are not quite closed; and if you observe them narrowly, you will see the eyes frequently twinkle, with the white of them turned up. There is a kind of tremulous motion in the muscles of the face and lips, which produces something like a frown or a smile, and sometimes almost the appearance of a laugh. As the disorder increases, the infant's breath seems now and then to stop for a little; the nose becomes pinched; there is a pale circle about the eyes and mouth, which sometimes changes to livid, and comes and goes by turns; the child starts, especially if you attempt to stir it though ever so gently, or if you make any noise near it. Thus disturbed, it sighs, or breaks wind, which gives relief for a little, but presently it relapses into the dozing. Sometimes it struggles hard before it can break wind, and seems as if falling into convulsions; but a violent burst of wind from the stomach, or vomiting, or a loud fit of crying, sets all to rights again. As the child increases in strength, these fits are the more apt to go off spontaneously and by degrees; but in case they do not, and if there is nothing done to remove them, they either degenerate into an almost constant drawfiness, (which is succeeded by a fever and the thrush), or else they terminate in vomitings, foul, curdled, or green stools, the watery gripes, and convulsions. The thrush indeed very often terminates in these last symptoms. As these complaints naturally run into one another, or succeed one another, they may be considered, in a manner, as only different stages of the same disease, and which derive their origin from the same cause. Thus, the inward fits may be looked upon as the first stage of the disorder; the fever, and thrush (when it happens), as the second; the vomitings, foul, curdled, green or watery stools, as the third; and convulsions, as the last.\n\nAs to the cause of these complaints, he observes, that in infants the glandular secretions, which are all more or less glutinous, are much more copious than in adults. During the time of sucking, the glands of the mouth and fauces being squeezed by the contraction of the muscles, pour forth their contents plentifully; which afterwards mixing with the mucus of the gullet\nDiseases of and stomach, render the milk of a illthy constilence, by which means it is not so readily absorbed into the lacteals; and as in most infants there is too great an acidity in the stomach, the milk is thereby curdled, which adds to the load; hence sickness and spasms, which, being communicated by sympathy to the nerves of the gullet and fauces, produce the convulsive motions above described, which go commonly by the name of inward fits. The air, likewise, which is drawn in during suction, mixing with the milk, &c. in the stomach, perhaps contributes towards increasing the spasms above mentioned. Dr Armstrong is the more induced to attribute these fits to the causes now assigned, that they always appear immediately after sucking or feeding; especially if the child has been long at the breast, or fed heartily, and has been laid down to sleep without having first broken wind. Another reason is, that nothing relieves them so soon as belching or vomiting; and the milk or food they throw up is generally either curdled, or mixed with a large quantity of heavy phlegm. If they be not relieved by belching or vomiting, the fits sometimes continue a good while, and gradually abate, according as the contents of the stomach are pushed into the intestines; and as soon as the former is pretty well emptied, the child is waked by hunger, cries, and wants the breast; he sucks, and the same process is repeated.\u2014Thus, some children for the first weeks are kept almost always in a dole, or seemingly so; especially if the nurses, either through laziness or want of skill, do not take care to rouse them when they perceive that it is not a right sleep, and keep them awake at proper intervals. This dozing is reckoned a bad sign amongst experienced nurses; who look upon it as a forerunner of the thrush, as indeed it often is; and therefore, when it happens, we ought to be upon our guard to use the necessary precautions for preventing that disorder.\n\nFor these disorders, the only remedy recommended by Dr Armstrong is antimonial wine, given in a few drops, according to the age of the infant. By this means the superabundant mucus will no doubt be evacuated; but at the same time we must remember, that this evacuation can only palliate, and not cure the disease. This can only be effected by tonics; and, when from inward fits and other symptoms it appears that the tone of the stomach is very weak, a decoction of cinchona, made into a syrup, will readily be taken by infants, and may be safely exhibited from the very day they come into the world, or as soon as their bowels are emptied of the meconium by the mother\u2019s milk or any other means.\n\nDr Clarke observes, that fractures of the limbs, and compressions of the brain, often happen in difficult labours; and that the latter are often followed by convulsions soon after delivery. In these cases, he says, it will be advisable to let the navel-string bleed two or three spoonfuls before it be tied. Thus the oppression of the brain will be relieved, and the disagreeable consequences just mentioned will be prevented. But if this has been neglected, and fits have actually come on, we must endeavour to make a revulsion by all the means in our power; as by opening the jugular vein, procuring an immediate discharge of the urine and meconium, and applying small blisters to the back, legs, or behind the ears. The semicuprum, too, would seem to be useful in this case, by driving the offensive load of fluids from the head and upper parts.\n\nIt sometimes happens after a tedious labour, that the child is so faint and weak as to discover little or no signs of life. In such a case, after the usual cleansing, the body should be immediately wrapped in warm flannel, and briskly tossed about in the nurse\u2019s arms, in order, if possible, to excite the languid circulation. If this fail, the breast and temples may be rubbed with brandy or other spirits; or the child may be provoked to cry, by whipping, or other stimulating methods, as the application of onion, or salt and spirit of hartshorn, to the mouth and nostrils. But after all these expedients have been tried in vain, and the recovery of the child absolutely despaired of, it has sometimes been happily revived by introducing a short catheter or blowpipe into the mouth, and gently blowing into the lungs at different intervals. Such children, however, are apt to remain weak for a considerable time, so that it is often no easy matter to rear them; and therefore particular care and tenderness will be required in their management, that nothing may be omitted which can contribute either to their preservation or the improvement of their strength and vigour.\n\nAll the disorders which arise from a retention of the meconium, such as the red gum, may easily be removed by the use of gentle laxatives; but the great source of mortality among children is the breeding of their teeth. The usual symptoms produced by this are fretting, restlessness; frequent and sudden startings, especially in sleep; coliciveness; and sometimes a violent diarrhoea, fever, or convulsions. In general, those children breed their teeth with the greatest ease, who have a moderate laxity of the bowels, or a plentiful flow of saliva during that time.\n\nIn mild cases, we need only, when necessary, endeavour to promote the means by which nature is observed to carry on the business of digestion in the easiest manner. For this purpose, if a coliciveness be threatened, it must be prevented, and the body kept always gently open; the gums should be relaxed by rubbing them frequently with sweet oils, or other softening remedies of that kind, which will greatly diminish the tension and pain. At the same time, as children about this period are generally disposed to chew whatever they get into their hands, they ought never to be without something that will yield a little to the pressure of their gums, as a crust of bread, a wax candle, a bit of licorice root, or such like; for the repeated muscular action, occasioned by the constant biting and gnawing at such a substance, will increase the discharge from the salivary glands, while the gums will be so forcibly pressed against the advancing teeth, as to make them break out much sooner, and with less uneasiness, than would otherwise happen. Some likewise recommend a slice of the rind of fresh bacon, as a proper masticatory for the child, in order to bring moisture into its mouth, and facilitate the eruption of the teeth by exercising the gums. If these means, however, prove ineffectual, and bad symptoms begin to appear, the patient will often be relieved immediately by cutting the inflamed gum down to the tooth, where a small white point shows the latter to be coming forward. When the pulse is quick, the skin hot and dry, and the child of a sufficient age and strength, emptying the vessels by bleeding,\nDiseases of Children.\n\nSterling to their patients such medicines as are possessed only of an anthelmintic quality, but to join them with those which are particularly adapted for cleansing the prime vice; as it is uncertain whether a foulness of the bowels may not be the cause of all the complaints. This practice is still the more advisable, on account of viscid humours in the intestines affording lodgement to the ova of worms; which, without the convenience of such a receptacle, would be more speedily discharged from the body.\n\nThe difficulty of curing what is called a worm fever, arises, according to Dr Mulgrave, from its being frequently attributed to worms, when the cause of the disorder is of a quite different nature. He does not mean to deny that worms do sometimes abound in the human body, nor that the irritation caused by them does sometimes produce a fever; but he apprehends these cases to be much more uncommon than is generally imagined, and that great mischief is done by treating some of the disorders of children as worm cases, which really are not so. Dr Hunter is of the same opinion on this point. He has, we are told, dissected great numbers of children who have been supposed to die of worm fevers, and whose complaints were of course treated as proceeding from worms, in whom, however, there appeared, upon dissection, to be not only no worms, but evident proofs of the disorder's having been of a very different nature.\n\nThe furious worm fever, as Dr Mulgrave terms it, has, in all the instances he has seen of it, arisen evidently from the children having been indulged with too great quantities of fruit. Every sort of fruit eaten in excess will probably produce it; but an immoderate use of cherries seems to be the most common cause of it. The approach of this disorder has a different appearance, according to it arises from a habit of eating fruit in rather too large quantities, or from an excessive quantity eaten at one time. In the former case, the patient gradually grows weak and languid; his colour becomes pale and livid; his belly swells and grows hard; his appetite and digestion are destroyed; his nights grow restless, or at least his sleep is much disturbed with startings, and then the fever soon follows, in the progress of which, the patient grows comatose, and at times convulsed; in which state, when it takes place to a high degree, he often dies. The pulse at the wrist, though quick, is never strong or hard; the carotids, however, beat with great violence, and elevate the skin so as to be distinctly seen at a distance. The heat is at times considerable, especially in the trunk; though at other times, when the brain is much oppressed, it is little more than natural. It is sometimes accompanied by a violent pain of the epigastric region, though more commonly the pain is slight, and terminates in a coma; some degree of pain, however, seems to be inseparable from it, so clearly to distinguish this disorder from other comatose affections.\n\nWhen a large quantity of fruit has been eaten at once, the attack of the disorder is instantaneous, and its progress rapid; the patient often passing, in the space of a few hours, from apparently perfect health, to a fluid, comatose, and almost dying state. The symptoms of the fever, when formed, are in both cases nearly the same; except that, in this latter fort, a little purulent matter is sometimes discharged, both by vomit\nmit and stool, from the very first day. The stools, in both cases, exhibit sometimes a kind of curd resembling curdled milk, at other times a floating substance is observed in them; and sometimes a number of little threads and pellicles, and now and then a single worm.\n\nStrong purgatives, or purges frequently repeated, in this disorder, are greatly condemned by Dr Armstrong, as they in general not only aggravate the symptoms already present, but are sometimes the origin of convulsions. Bloodletting is not to be thought of in any stage of the disorder.\n\nAlthough frequent purging, however, be not recommended, yet a single vomit and purge are advised in the beginning of the disorder, with a view to evacuate such indigested matter and mucus as happens to remain in the stomach and bowels. These having operated properly, there is seldom occasion for repeating them; and it is sufficient, if the body be constipated, to throw up, every second or third day, a clyster composed of some grains of aloes, dissolved in five or six ounces of infusion of chamomile.\n\nThe principal part of the cure, however, depends upon external applications to the bowels and stomach; and as the cause of the disorder is of a cold nature, the applications must be warm, cordial, and invigorating; and their action must be promoted by constant actual heat.\n\nWhen any nervous symptoms come on, or remain after the disorder is abated, they are easily removed by giving a pill with a grain or two of asafoetida once or twice a day.\n\nThe diagnostics of worms are very uncertain; but, even in real worm cases, the treatment above recommended would, it is imagined, be much more efficacious than the practice commonly had recourse to. As worms either find the constitution weakly, or very soon make it so, the frequent repetition of purges, particularly mercurials, cannot but have a pernicious effect. Bear's-foot is still more exceptionable, being in truth to be ranked rather among poisons than medicines. Worm seed and bitters are too offensive to the palate and stomach to be long persisted in, though sometimes very useful. The powder of coralline creates disgust by its quantity; and the infusion of pink root is well known to occasion now and then vertiginous complaints and fits.\n\nFomenting the belly night and morning with a strong decoction of rue and wormwood, is much recommended. It is a perfectly safe remedy, and, by invigorating the bowels, may thereby have some influence in rendering them capable of expelling such worms as they happen to contain. After the fomentation, it is advised to anoint the belly with a liniment, composed of one part of essential oil of rue, and two parts of a decoction of rue in sweet oil. It is, however, a matter of great doubt whether these external applications, in consequence of the articles with which they are impregnated, exert any influence on the worms themselves.\n\nThe diet of children disposed to worms should be warm and nourishing, consisting in part at least of animal food, which is not the worse for being a little seasoned. The drink may be any kind of beer that is well hopped, with now and then a small draught of porter or negus. A total abstinence from butter is not so necessary, perhaps, as is generally imagined. Poor cheese must by all means be avoided; but such as is rich and pungent, in a moderate quantity, is particularly serviceable. In the spasmodic worm fever, the patient should be supported occasionally by small quantities of broth; and, at the close of it, when the appetite returns, the first food given should be of the kinds above recommended.\n\nThe diet here recommended will, perhaps, be thought extraordinary, as the general idea is at present, that, in the management of children, nothing is so much to be avoided as repletion and rich food. It is no doubt an error to feed children too well, or to indulge them with wine and rich sauces; but it is equally an error to confine them to too strict or too poor a diet, which weakens their digestion, and renders them much more subject to disorders of every kind, but particularly to disorders of the bowels. In regard to the spasmodic worm fever, if it be true that acid fruits too plentifully eaten are the general cause of it, it follows as a consequence, that a warm nutritious diet, moderately used, will most effectually counteract the mischief, and soonest restore the natural powers of the stomach. Besides, if the disorder does not readily yield to the methods here directed, as there are many examples of its terminating by an inflammation and suppuration of the navel, it is highly advisable to keep this probability in view, and, by a moderate allowance of animal food, to support those powers of nature, from which only such a happy crisis is to be expected.\n\nBesides these, many other diseases might here be mentioned, which, if not peculiar to infants, are at least peculiarly modified by the infant state. But into details respecting these we cannot propose to enter. It is sufficient to say, that due regard being paid to age and constitution, the cure is to be conducted on the same general principles as in the adult state.","sp":75,"ep":82},{"h":"MEDICINE","t":"And there is every reason to hope, that this appointment will be attended with many effects highly beneficial to the nation.\n\nA short view of the extent and importance of this subject will, we presume, not be unacceptable to the intelligent reader.\n\nWhatever aid the science of medicine can contribute towards the good of the state, and the execution of its laws, has been by the Germans denominated State Medicine; a new, but not improper, appellation, for that branch of knowledge which many writers have termed Medical Jurisprudence.\n\nIt comprehends both medical police and juridical medicine. The former consists of the medical precepts which may be of use to the legislature or to the magistracy. The latter is the aggregate of all the information, afforded by the different branches of medicine, which is necessary for elucidating doubtful questions in courts of law.\n\nAlthough there are some traces of juridical medicine in the Justinian code; such as determining the real period of birth, with a view to prevent the imposition of spurious children: it properly originated with the code of laws enacted by the emperor Charles V. under the name of Constitutione criminalis Carolina; in which it is ordained, that the opinions of physicians should be taken, with regard to the danger of wounds, child murder, murder, poisoning, procured abortion, concealed pregnancy, &c. These directions, and the impossibility which was found of determining many questions by simply legal means, induced some legislators to enjoin, that all tribunals and judges should procure from sworn physicians, appointed to this office, their opinions concerning all the subjects to be mentioned hereafter.\n\nSince that time, it has been treated systematically by many learned men; such as Fortunatus Fidelis, Zacchias, Alberti, Hebenstreit, Haller, Ludwig, Plenck; and lastly, in the most masterly manner, by Metzger. Numberless dissertations have been written on all its parts; and among those who contributed to its advancement, we may reckon Ambrose Parry, Bolin, Butener, Morgagni, Camper, and Gruner. Collections of cases, illustrating its principles, have been made by Amman, Daniel, Bucholz, Pyl, Scheff and Metzger. These are only a few of the principal writers, who have attended to this science: to enumerate more would be unnecessary.\n\nFrom its very nature, it is evident how necessary a knowledge of this science must be to every medical practitioner, who is liable to be called upon to illustrate any question comprehended under it before a court of justice. On his answers, the fate of the accused person must often depend; both judge and jury regulating their decision by his opinion. On the other hand, while he is delivering his sentiments, his own reputation is before the bar of the public. The acuteness of the gentlemen of the law is universally acknowledged; the versatility of their genius, and the quickness of their apprehension, are rendered almost inconceivable, by constant exercise. It is their duty to make every possible exertion for the interest of their client, and they seldom leave unnoticed any inaccurate or contradictory evidence. How cautious must, then, a medical practitioner be, when examined before such men, when it is their duty to expose his errors, and magnify his uncertainties, till his evil influence seem contradictory and absurd? How often must he expose himself to such severe criticism, if he be not master of the subject on which he is giving evidence, and have not arranged his thoughts on it according to just principles? On the other hand, he may deserve and gain much credit, by so public a display of judgement and professional knowledge.\n\nSome acquaintance with this part of medical science must be useful at least, and sometimes necessary, to judges and lawyers. They will thus be enabled to estimate how much they may depend on the opinion of any physician, and will know how to direct their questions, so as to arrive at the truth, and avoid being misled by his partiality or favourite opinions. To the lawyer who conducts the defence of an accused person, in a criminal case, it is almost indispensible; without it, he cannot do justice to the cause of his client.\n\nBefore criminal courts, the questions which occur most generally are, respecting\n\n1.

His conduct was distinguished for urbanity and kindness to the superior ranks of his fellow citizens, and by a constant attention to the wants of the lower classes, whom his munificence abundantly relieved. His prudence and moderation, however, could not repel the ambitious designs of the rival families, the Florentines and Medici; for in 1433, Rinaldo de Albizzi, at the head of a formidable party, carried the appointment of the magistracy. On returning from his country seat he was seized upon by his adversaries, and committed to prison. The conspirators not agreeing as to the proper method of dispatching their prisoner, one Peruzzi recommended poison, which was heard by Cosmo, who refused to take any other sustenance than a small portion of bread. In this dismal situation he remained four days, shut up from all his kindred and friends, where he soon expected to be numbered with the dead. But the man employed to take him off, unexpectedly proved his friend. Malavolta, the keeper of the prison, relented, and declared that he had no just reason to be alarmed, as he hesitated not to eat of every thing that was brought him.\n\nHis brother Lorenzo, and his cousin Averardo, raised a considerable body of men in Romagna and other districts; and being joined by the commander of the republican forces, they marched to Florence to relieve him. A decree was obtained from the magistracy, by which he was banished to Padua for ten years, his brother to Venice for five, and several of their relations shared a similar fate. Padua was in the dominions of Venice, and he received a deputation from the senate before he reached it, promising him their protection and assistance in whatever he should desire. He rather experienced the treatment of a prince than of an exile, as they entertained the highest expectations from his great commercial knowledge. From this period his life may be considered as one continued scene of uninterrupted prosperity, and his family received education equal to that of the greatest potentates.

The countenance he shewed to these arts was not such as their professors generally receive from the great; for the sums of money which he expended on pictures, statues, and public buildings, appear almost incredible. When he approached the period of his mortal existence, his faculties were still unimpaired; and 20 days before he died, he requested Ficino to translate from the Greek the treatise of Xenocrates on death. He died on the 1st of August 1464, at the age of 75, and gave strict injunctions, that his funeral should be conducted with as much privacy as possible.

It had for some time a school of philosophers, called the Megarici, successors of Euclid the Socratic, a native of Megara. Their dialect was the Doric; changed from the Attic, which it formerly had been, because of Peloponnesian colonists who settled there.\n\nMegara was situated at a distance from the sea. Its port was called Nysa, from Nysus son of Pandion the second, who obtained Megaris for his portion, when the kingdom of Athens was divided into four lots by his father. He founded the town, which was eighteen stadia or two miles and a quarter from the city, but united with it, as the Piraeus with Athens, by long walls. It had a temple of Ceres. \"The roof (says Pausanias) may be supposed to have fallen through age.\" The site (as Dr. Chandler informs us*) * Travels is now covered with rubbish, among which are standing some ruined churches. The place has been named from them Dode Ekeleiai, \"The Twelve Churches;\" but the number is reduced to seven. The acropolis or citadel, called also Nysa, was on a rock by the sea side. Some pieces of the wall remain, and a modern fortress has been erected on it, and also on a lesser rock near it.\n\nThe village Megara (continues the doctor) consists of low mean cottages pleasantly situated on the slope of a brow or eminence indented in the middle. On each side of this vale was an acropolis or citadel; one named Caria; the other from Alcathous, the builder of the wall. They related, that he was afflicted by Apollo, who laid his harp aside on a stone, which, as Pausanias testifies, if struck with a pebble returned a musical sound. An angle of the wall of one citadel is seen by a windmill. The masonry is of the species called Incertum. In 1676 the city wall was not entirely demolished, but comprehended the two summits, on which are some churches, with a portion of the plain toward the south. The whole field, except the hills, was now green with corn, and marked by many heaps of stones, the collected rubbish of buildings. A few inscriptions are found, with pedestals fixed in the walls and inverted; and also some maimed or mutilated\nMegara mutilated statues. One of the former relates to Attilus Herodes, and is on a pedestal which supported a statue erected to him when consul, A.D. 143, by the council and people of Megara, in return for his benefactions and good will toward the city. In the plain behind the summits, on one of which was a temple of Minerva, is a large basin of water, with scattered fragments of marble, the remains of a bath or of a fountain, which is recorded as in the city, and remarkable for its size and ornaments, and for the number of its columns. The spring was named from the local nymphs called Sithnides.\n\nThe stone of Megara was of a kind not discovered anywhere else in Hellas; very white, uncommonly soft, and consisting entirely of cockle shells. This was chiefly used; and, not being durable, may be reckoned among the causes of the defoliation at Megara, which is so complete, that one searches in vain for vestiges of the many public edifices, temples, and sepulchres, which once adorned the city.\n\nMegara was engaged in various wars with Athens and Corinth, and experienced many vicissitudes of fortune. It was the only one of the Greek cities which did not flourish under their common benefactor Hadrian; and the reason assigned is, that the avenging anger of the gods pursued the people for their impiety in killing Anthemocritus, a herald, who had been sent to them in the time of Pericles. The Athenian generals were sworn on his account to invade them twice a-year. Hadrian and Atticus were followed by another friend, whose memory is preserved by an inscription on a stone lying near a church in the village:\n\n\"This too is the work of the most magnificent count Diogenes son of Archelaus, who regarding the Grecian cities as his own family, has bestowed on that of the Megarensians one hundred pieces of gold towards the building of their towers, and also one hundred and fifty more, with two thousand two hundred feet of marble toward re-edifying the bath; deeming nothing more honourable than to do good to the Greeks, and to restore their cities.\" This person is not quite unnoticed in history. He was one of the generals employed by the emperor Anastasius on a rebellion in Ifauria. He surprised the capital Claudiolipolis, and sustained a siege with great bravery, A.D. 494.\n\nMegara retains its original name. It has been much infested by corsairs; and in 1676 the inhabitants were accustomed, on seeing a boat approach in the daytime or hearing their dogs bark at night, immediately to secrete their effects and run away. The vassal or Turkish governor, who resided in a forsaken tower above the village, was once carried off. It is no wonder, therefore, that Nifsea has been long abandoned.

He lived at Pylos in Peloponnesus. His servants once killed two large serpents who had made their nests at the bottom of a large oak; and Melampus paid so much regard to their remains, that he raised a burning pile and burned them upon it. He also took particular care of their young ones, and fed them with milk. Some time after this, the young serpents crept to Melampus as he slept on the grass near the oak; and, as if sensible of the favours of their benefactor, they wantonly played around him, and softly licked his ears. This awoke Melampus, who was astonished at the sudden change which his fens had undergone. He found himself acquainted with the chirping of the birds, and with all their rude notes, as they flew around him. He took advantage of this supernatural gift, and soon made himself perfect in the knowledge of futurity, and Apollo also instructed him in the art of medicine. He had soon after the happiness of curing the daughters of Proetus, by giving them hellebore, which from that circumstance has been called melampodium; and, as a reward for his trouble, he married the eldest of these princesses. The tyranny of his uncle Neleus, king of Pylos, obliged him to leave his native country; and Proetus, to show himself more sensible of his services, gave him part of his kingdom. About this time the personal charms of Pero, the daughter of Neleus, had gained many admirers; but the father promised his daughter only to him who brought into his hands the oxen of Iphicles. This condition displeased many; but Bias, who was also one of her admirers, engaged his brother Melampus to steal the oxen and deliver them to him. Melampus was caught in the attempt, and imprisoned; and nothing but his services as a footfayrer and physician to Iphicles would have saved him from death. All this pleaded in the favour of Melampus; but when he had taught the children Iphicles how to become a father, he not only obtained his liberty, but also the oxen; and with them he compelled Neleus to give Pero in marriage to Bias. A severe distemper, which had rendered the women of Argos insane, was totally removed by Melampus; and Anaxagoras, who then sat on the throne, rewarded his merit by giving him part of his kingdom, where he established himself, and where his posterity reigned during six successive generations.

In his youth he made an admirable progress in learning, and was made Greek professor at Wittenberg in 1509. Here his lectures upon Homer, and the Greek text of St Paul's Epistle to Titus, drew to him a great number of auditors, and entirely effaced the contempt to which his low stature and mean appearance had exposed him. Melanchthon reduced the sciences to systems; and acquired such reputation, that he had sometimes 2,500 auditors. He soon entered into an intimate friendship with Luther, who taught divinity in the same university; and in 1519 they went together to Leipzig, to dispute with Eicus. The following years he was continually engaged in various employments; he composed several books; he taught divinity; took several journeys, in order to found colleges and visit churches; and in 1530 drew up a confession of faith, which goes by the name of the Confession of Augsburg, because it was presented to the emperor at the diet held in that city. All Europe was convinced, that he was not, like Luther, backward to accommodate the differences between the various sects of Christians. He hated religious disputes, and was drawn into them only through the necessity of the part he was called to act in the world; and therefore would have sacrificed many things to have produced an union among the Protestants. For this reason, Francis I., the French king, wrote to desire him to come and confer with the doctors of the Sorbonne, in order to agree with them about putting an end to all controversies; but though Luther endeavoured to persuade the elector of Saxony to consent to that journey, and though Melanchthon himself desired it, that prince, whether he distrusted Melanchthon's moderation, or was afraid of quarrelling with the emperor Charles V., would never grant his permission. The king of England also vainly desired to see him. Melanchthon, in 1529, assisted at the conferences of Spire. In 1541, he was at the famous conferences at Ratibon. In 1543, he went to meet the archbishop of Cologne to assist him in introducing the reformation into his diocese; but that project came to nothing; and in 1548, he assisted at seven conferences on the subject of the interim of Charles V., and wrote a censure on that interim, and all the writings presented at these conferences. He was extremely affected at the divisions raised by Flacius Illyricus. His last conference with those of the Roman communion was at Worms, in 1557. He died at Wittenberg in 1560, and was interred near Luther. Some days before he died, he wrote upon a piece of paper the reasons which made him look upon death as a happiness; and the chief of them was, that it \"delivered him from theological persecutions.\" Nature had given Melanchthon a peaceable temper, which was but ill suited to the time he was to live in. His moderation served only to be his cross. He was like a lamb in the midst of wolves. Nobody liked his mildness; it looked as if he was...\nwas lukewarm; and even Luther himself was sometimes angry at it.\n\nMelanchthon was a man in whom many good as well as great qualities were wonderfully united. He had great parts, great learning, great sweetness of temper, moderation, contentedness, and the like, which would have made him very happy in any other times but those in which he lived. He never affected dignities, or honours, or riches, but was rather negligent of all these things; too much so in the opinion of some, considering he had a family; and his son-in-law Sabinus, who was of a more ambitious temper, was actually at variance with him upon this very account. Learning was infinitely obliged to him on many accounts; on none more than this, that, as already observed, he reduced almost all the sciences which had been taught before in a vague irregular manner, into systems. Considering the distractions of his life, and the infinity of disputes and tumults in which he was engaged, it is astonishing how he could find leisure to write so many books. Their number is prodigious, inasmuch that it was thought necessary to publish a chronological catalogue of them in the year 1582. His works indeed are not correct, and he himself owned it: but as he found them useful, he chose rather to print a great number, than to finish only a few: \"which however (as Bayle says), was pollporing his own glory to the advantage of others.\" His constitution was very weak, and required great tenderness and management; which made Luther, as hot and zealous as he was, blame him for labouring too earnestly in the vineyard.","sp":97,"ep":98},{"h":"MELANIPPIDES","t":"in fabulous history, a Greek poet about 520 years before Christ.

The scripture tells us nothing either of his father, or of his mother, or of his genealogy, or of his birth, or of his death. And in this sense he was a figure of Jesus Christ, as St Paul affirms, who is a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedec, and not according to the order of Aaron, whose original, life, and death, are known. When Abraham returned from pursuing the four confederate kings, who had defeated the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah, and had taken away Lot Abraham's nephew along with them (Gen. xiv. 17, 18, 19, &c.) Melchisedec came to meet Abraham as far as the valley of Shaveh, which was afterwards named the King's valley, presented him with the refreshment of bread and wine (or he offered bread and wine in sacrifice to the Lord, for he was a priest of the most high God), and blessed him. Abraham, being desirous to acknowledge in him the quality of priest of the Lord, offered him the tithes of all he had taken from the enemy. After this time, there is no mention made of the person of Melchisedec; only the Psalmist (cx. 4.) speaking of the Messiah, says, \"Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.\" St Paul, in his epistle to the Hebrews, unfolds the mystery which is concealed in what is said of Melchisedec in the Old Testament. See Heb. v. 6\u201410. An infinite number of difficulties and scruples have been started upon the subject of Melchisedec.\u2014St Jerome thought that Salem, of which Melchisedec was king, was not Jerusalem, but the city of Salem near Scythopolis, where they still pretended to show the ruins of the palace of this prince. The greatness and extent of these ruins are a sufficient proof of the magnificence of this ancient building. He thinks it was at this city of Salem or Shalem, that Jacob arrived after his passage over Jordan, at his return from Mesopotamia (Gen. xxxiii. 18.). Some believe that Salem, where Melchisedec reigned, is the same as Salim spoken of in the gospel of St John, chap. iii. 23. From the time of Epiphanes there were names invented for the father and mother of Melchisedec. To his father was given the name of Heraclas or Heracles, and to his mother that of Alhtaroth or Astaria. It is generally agreed on by the learned, that when the apostle says, he was \"without father and without mother,\" no more is meant, than that he is introduced into the history of Abraham without acquainting us who he was, or whence he came, where he lived, or when he died. Nevertheless, some have taken St Paul's words literally, and contended that he was not of human but divine nature. Origen and Didymus took him to be an angel; and the author of the Questions upon the Old and New Testament pretends, that he was the Holy Ghost, who appeared to Abraham in a human form. The Arabic Catena, upon the ninth chapter of Genesis, makes Melchisedec to be descended from Shem by his father, and from Japheth by his mother. Heraclas or Heraclim his father, was, they say, son or grandson of Phaleg, and son of Heber; and his mother named Salathiel, was daughter of Gomer son of Japheth. Cedrenus and others derive Melchisedec from an Egyptian stock. They say his father was called Sidon or Sida, and was the founder of the city of Sidon the capital of Phenicia. Suidas says he was of the cursed race of Canaan; for which reason the scripture does not mention his genealogy. The Jews and Samaritans believed Melchisedec to be the same\nMelchisedec was the patriarch Shem; which opinion has been followed by a great number of modern writers. M. Jurius undertook to prove that he is the same as Cham or Ham. It would be endless to set down all the opinions upon this matter; therefore we shall only add, that Peter Cuneus and Peter du Moulin have affirmed, that Melchisedec who appeared to Abraham was the Son of God, and that the patriarch worshipped him and acknowledged him for the Messiah.\n\nAbout the beginning of the third century arose the heresy of the Melchisedecians, who affirmed that Melchisedec was not a man, but a heavenly power, superior to Jesus Christ; for Melchisedec, they said, was the intercessor and mediator of the angels, but Jesus Christ was so only for men, and his priesthood only a copy of that of Melchisedec, who was the Holy Ghost.\n\nWe shall only beg leave to add here one opinion more concerning Melchisedec, which is that of the learned Heidegger, who, as the author of the *Hihi Patriar*, thinks, has taken the right method of explaining the accounts of Moses and the apostle Paul relating to this extraordinary person. He supposes a twofold Melchisedec; the one historical, whereof Moses gives an account in the 14th chapter of Genesis, as that he was king as well as high priest of Jerusalem; the other allegorical, whom St Paul describes, and this allegorical person is Jesus Christ.\n\nAs the history of this prince and priest is so little known, it is no wonder, as Selden observes, that many fabulous accounts have been invented of him; of which the following may suffice as a specimen. Eutychus patriarch of Alexandria relates, that the body of Adam having been embalmed according to his order, was deposited in a cave under a mountain of the children of Seth; but that Adam before his death had commanded that they should take away his remains from that place, and transport them to the middle of the earth: that Noah, to follow the orders of his ancestors, had preserved the bodies of Adam and all the patriarchs with him in the ark: that finding himself near his death, he ordered his son Shem to take the body of Adam, to furnish himself with bread and wine for his journey, to take with him Melchisedec the son of Phaleg, and to go to the place in which an angel would show them where to bury the first man: that Noah added this order, \"Command Melchisedec to fix his residence in that place, and to live unmarried all his lifetime, because God has chosen him to do service in his presence; command him, that he build no temple, nor shed the blood of birds, nor four-footed beasts, or any other animal; and that he offer no other oblations to God but bread and wine.\" This is the reason, according to this author, why Melchisedec, when he met Abraham, brought forth only bread and wine.\n\nA Greek author, under the name of Athanasius, relates, that Melchisedec was the son of an idolatrous king called Melchi and of a queen called Salem.\u2014Melchi, having resolved to offer a sacrifice to the gods, sent his son Melchisedec to fetch him seven calves. In the way the young prince was enlightened by God, and immediately returned to his father, to demonstrate to him the vanity of his idols. Melchi, in wrath, sent him back to fetch the victims. While he was absent, the king sacrificed his eldest son, and a great many Melchisedec's other children, to his gods. Melchisedec returning, and conceiving great horror at this butchery, retired to Mount Tabor, where he lived seven years, without clothes, and fed only on wild fruits. At the end of seven years, God appeared to Abraham, bid him go up to Mount Tabor, where he should find Melchisedec. He ordered him to clothe him, and to ask his blessing; which Abraham having done, Melchisedec anointed him with oil, and they came down together from the mountain.","sp":98,"ep":99},{"h":"MELCHITES","t":"in church history, the name given to the Syrian, Egyptian, and other Christians of the Levant.

It appears from the name to have been anciently the king's demesne, and from the records to have paid quit-rent to the crown all along after King Edward I. till it was bought off by the inhabitants before they were united to Weymouth. It lies on the north side of the haven, on a peninsula surrounded by the sea on all tides except on the north. The streets are broad and well paved, and many of the houses large and high. It lent members to parliament in the reign of King Edward I. before Weymouth had that privilege. It was by parliament appointed a staple in the reign of Edward III. In the next reign the French burnt it; and it was thereby rendered so desolate, that the remaining inhabitants prayed and obtained a discharge from customs. On account of its quarrels with Weymouth, in the reign of Henry VI. its privileges as a port were removed to Poole; but in that of Queen Elizabeth they were restored to it by act of parliament, which was confirmed in the next reign, on condition that Melcomb and Weymouth should make but one corporation, and enjoy their privileges in common; and to this was owing the flourishing state of both. In the two reigns last mentioned, a wooden bridge with seventeen arches was built from hence to Weymouth; to which, as well as its church, the chief contributors were certain citizens of London; and upon its decay it was rebuilt in 1770. Here is a good market-place and town-hall, to which the members of the corporation of Weymouth come to attend public business, as the inhabitants do to its church for public worship. For several years past the sea has retired from it on the east, the priory formerly being bounded by the sea; but there is now a street beyond it, from which it is several paces to the high water mark. The priory was situated in the east part of the town, in Maiden street, whose site occupied about an acre, now covered with tenements. On the south side are the remains of the chapel, now converted into a malt-house. Near it are the remains of an ancient building, formerly a nunnery. Here are three meeting houses and a workhouse for the poor. The church, which is in the middle of the town, has a wooden turret for a bell, and had been an old chapel. It was rebuilt in 1605, and made parochial, and is a handsome fabric, with a beautiful altarpiece painted and given by Sir James Thornhill. The port, which generally goes by the name of Weymouth, is said to be the best frequented in the county, and is defended by Sandford and Portland castles. The markets for both towns are Tuesdays and Fridays, but there are no fairs. Melcomb-regis is reckoned bigger, more thriving, and\nand populous than Weymouth. They are both but one corporation and borough, consisting of a mayor, recorder, two bailiffs, an uncertain number of aldermen, and twenty-four capital burgesses. Whoever has been a mayor is ever after an alderman. They send four burgesses to parliament, who are elected by such as have freeholds, whether they are inhabitants or not; the number of voters is near 700. Every elector, as in London, has the privilege of voting for four persons, who when chosen are returned, in two distinct indentures, as the burgesses of Weymouth and the burgesses of Melcombe-regis.","sp":99,"ep":100},{"h":"MELDAE","t":"in Ancient Geography, a town of Gallia Celtica, (called Meldorum Civitas in the Notitia), on the Matrona.

The Parcae were present at the moment of his birth, and predicted his future greatness. Clotho said that he would be brave and courageous; Lachesis foretold his uncommon strength and valour; and Atropos said that he should live as long as that firebrand, which was on the fire, remained entire and unconsumed. Althaea no sooner heard this, than she snatched the stick from the fire, and kept it with the most jealous care, as the life of her son totally depended upon its preservation. The fame of Meleager increased with his years; he signalized himself in the Argonautic expedition, and afterwards delivered his country from the neighbouring inhabitants, who made war against his father, at the instigation of Diana, whose altars \u00c6neas had neglected. But Diana punished the negligence of \u00c6neas by a greater calamity. She sent a huge wild boar, which laid waste all the country, and seemed invincible on account of its immense size. It became soon a public concern: all the neighbouring princes assembled to destroy this terrible animal; and nothing is more famous in mythological history, than the hunting of the Calydonian boar. The princes and chiefs that assembled, and which are mentioned by mythologists, were Meleager son of \u00c6neas, Idas and Lynceus sons of Aphareus, Dryas son of Mars, Caltor and Pollux sons of Jupiter and Leda, Pirithous son of Ixion, Theseus son of \u00c6geus, Anceus and Cepheus sons of Lycurgus, Admetus son of Pheres, Jason son of Aeson, Peleus and Telamon sons of \u00c6acus, Iphicles son of Amphitryon, Eurytrion son of Actor, Atalanta daughter of Schoeneus, Iolas the friend of Hercules, the sons of Thetis, Amphiraurus son of Oileus, Protheus, Cometes, the brothers of Althaea, Hippothous son of Cercyon, Leucippus, Adraustus, Ceneus, Phileus, Echion, Lelex, Phoenix son of Amyntor, Panopeus, Hyleus, Hippalus, Nellor, Menestius the father of Patroclus, Amphilochides, Laertes the father of Ulysses, and the four sons of Hippocoon. This troop of armed men attacked the boar, and it was at last killed by Meleager.\u2014The conqueror gave the skin and the head to Atalanta, who had first wounded the animal. This irritated the rest, and particularly Toxeus and Plexippus the brothers of Althaea, and they endeavoured to rob Atalanta of the honourable present. Meleager defended her, and killed his uncles in the attempt. Meantime the news of this celebrated conquest had already reached Calydon, and Althaea went to the temple of the Meleager gods to return thanks for the victory which her son had gained. But being informed that her brothers had been killed by Meleager, she in the moment of resentment threw into the fire the fatal stick on which her son's life depended, and Meleager died as soon as it was consumed. Homer does not mention the firebrand; whence some have imagined that this fable is posterior to that poet's age.

This island, with those of Carache, Canabac, and La Gallina, are the only ones where the Europeans may trade with some security. They trade, however, sometimes at the other islands, but they must be extremely cautious; and yet after all their precautions, they will be robbed and murdered if they venture to go ashore.

It is a somewhat singular circumstance, that the real author of this most admirable treatise should never before have been publicly known (it having been commonly attributed to the first earl of Melmota Egmont, and particularly by Mr Walpole in his Catalogue); which is the more surprising, as the author is plainly pointed out in the following short character prefixed to the book itself: \"It may add weight, perhaps, to the reflections contained in the following pages, to inform the reader, that the author's life was one uniform exemplar of those precepts which, with so generous a zeal, and such an elegant and affecting simplicity of style, he endeavours to recommend to general practice. He left others to contend for modes of faith, and inflame themselves and the world with endless controversy: it was the wiser purpose of his more ennobled aim, to act up to those clear rules of conduct which revelation hath graciously prescribed. He possessed by temper every moral virtue; by religion every Christian grace. He had a humanity that melted at every distress; a charity which not only thought no evil, but suspected none. He exercised his profession with a skill and integrity which nothing could equal but the disinterested motive that animated his labours, or the amiable modesty which accompanied all his virtues. He employed his industry, not to gratify his own desires; no man indulged himself less; not to accumulate useless wealth; no man more disdained so unworthy a pursuit: it was for the decent advancement of his family, for the generous affluence of his friends, for the ready relief of the indigent. How often did he exert his distinguished abilities, yet refuse the reward of them, in defence of the widow, the fatherless, and him that had none to help him!

Vocal melody is called singing; and that which is performed upon instruments may be termed symphonic melody.\n\nThe idea of rhythmus necessarily enters into that of melody. An air is not an air but in proportion as the laws of measure and quantity are observed. The same succession of sounds is susceptible of as many different characters, as many different kinds of melody, as the various ways by which its emphatic notes, and the quantities of those which intervene, may be diversified; and the change in duration of the notes alone, may disguise that very succession in such a manner that it cannot be known. Thus, melody in itself is nothing; it is the rhythmus or measure which determines it, and there can be no air without time. If then we abstract measure...\nmeasure from both, we cannot compare melody with harmony; for to the former it is essential, but not at all to the latter.\n\nMelody, according to the manner in which it is considered, has a relation to two different principles. When regarded only as agreeable to the proportions of sound and the rules of modulation, it has its principle in harmony; since it is a harmonical analysis, which exhibits the different gradations of the scale, the chords peculiar to each mode, and the laws of modulation, which are the sole elements that compose an air. According to this principle, the whole power of melody is limited to that of pleasing the ear by agreeable sounds, as the eye may be pleased with an agreeable assemblage of suitable colours. But when considered as an imitative art, by which we may affect the mind with various images, excite different emotions in the heart, inflame or soothe the passions; by which, in a word, we produce different effects upon our moral faculties, which are not to be effectuated by the influence of external sense alone, we must explore another principle for melody: for in our whole internal frame there appears to be no power upon which either harmony alone, or its necessary results, can seize, to affect us in such a manner.\n\nWhat then is the second principle? It is as much founded on nature as the first; but, in order to discover its foundation in nature, it will require a more accurate though simpler observation, and a more exquisite degree of sensibility in the observer. This principle is the same which varies the tone of the voice, when we speak; according as we are interested in what we say, and according to the different emotions which we feel in expressing it. It is the accent of languages which determines the melody of every nation; it is the accent which determines us to employ the emphasis of speaking while we sing, and to speak with more or less energy according as the language which we use is more or less accented. That language whose accents are the most sensible, ought to produce a more passionate and more lively melody; that which has little accentuation, or none at all, can only produce a cold and languid melody, without character and without expression. These are the true principles: in proportion as we depart from them, when we speak of the power of music upon the human heart, we shall become unintelligible to ourselves and others: our words will be without meaning.\n\nIf music does not impress the soul with images but by melody, if from thence it obtains its whole power, it must follow, that all musical sounds which are not pleasing by themselves alone, however agreeable to harmony they may be, is not an imitative music; and, being incapable, even with its most beautiful chords, either to present the images of things, or to excite the finer feelings, very soon cloy the ear, and leaves always the heart in cold indifference. It follows likewise, that notwithstanding the parts which harmony has introduced, and which the present taste of music so wantonly abuses, wherever two different melodies are heard at the same time, they counteract each other, and destroy the effects of both, however beautiful each may be when performed alone: from whence it may be judged with what degree of taste the French composers have introduced in their operas the miserable practice of accompanying one air with another, as well in singing, which is the native expression of pathos and sentiment, as in instrumental performances; which is the same thing as if whimsical orators should take it in their heads to recite two orations at the same time, that the elegance of each might derive more force from the other.\n\nSo much for Rousseau. The translator, however, has reason to fear, that the causes by which national melody is diversified and characterized, are more profound and permanent than the mere accentuation of language. This indeed may have great influence in determining the nature of the rhythmus, and the place of emphatic notes; but very little in regulating the nature of the emphasis and expression themselves. If Rousseau's principle be true in its full extent, he must of necessity acknowledge, that an air which was never set or intended for words, however melodious, cannot be imitative; he must likewise confess, that what is imitative in one nation cannot be such in another: nor can it be denied, upon his hypothesis, that the recitative, which is formed upon the mode of speaking, is the most forcible of all melodies; which is absurd. His other observations are at once judicious and profound. Though it is impossible to exhibit the beauty and variety of harmony by playing the same melody at the same time upon different keys, admitting those keys to form among themselves a perfect chord, which will of consequence preserve all the subsequent notes in the same intervals; yet this perfect harmony would by no means be uniformly pleasing to the ear. We must therefore of necessity introduce less perfect chords to vary and increase the pleasure, and these chords in any complex system of music must of necessity produce dissonances. It then becomes the business of the composer to be careful that these dissonances may arise as naturally from, and return as naturally to perfect harmony as possible. All these causes must inevitably vary the melody of the different parts; but still, amidst all these difficulties, the artist ought to be zealous in preserving the melody of each as homogeneous with the others as possible, that the result of the whole may be in some measure uniform. Otherwise, by counteracting each other, the parts will reciprocally destroy the effects one of another.","sp":102,"ep":103},{"h":"MELOE","t":"a genus of insects of the order of coleoptera.

He came with a body of 10,000 men to assist his uncle Priam, during the Trojan war. He behaved with great courage, and killed Antilochus, Nestor's son. The aged father challenged\nlenged the Ethiopian monarch; but Mennon refused it on account of the venerable age of Nestor, and accepted that of Achilles. He was killed in the combat, in the fight of the Grecian and Trojan armies. Aurora prayed Jupiter to grant her son such honours as might distinguish him from other mortals. The god consented; and immediately a numerous flight of birds issued from the burning pile on which the body was laid, and dividing themselves into two separate bodies, fought with such fury, that above half of them fell down in the fire as victims to appease the manes of Mennon. These birds were called Memnonides; and it has been observed by some of the ancients, that they never failed to return yearly to the tomb of Mennon in Troas, and repeat the same bloody engagement in honour of the hero from whom they received their name. The Ethiopians or Egyptians, over whom Mennon reigned, erected a celebrated statue to the honour of their monarch. This statue had the wonderful property of uttering a melodious sound every day at sunrise, like that which is heard at the breaking of the string of a harp when it is wound up. This was effected by the rays of the sun when they fell upon it. At the setting of the sun, and in the night, the sound was lugubrious. This is supported by the testimony of the geographer Strabo, who confesses himself ignorant whether it proceeded from the basis of the statue, or the people that were then around it.

What we distinctly remember to have perceived, we as firmly believe to have happened, as what is now present to our senses.\n\nThe opinions of philosophers concerning the means by which the mind retains the ideas of past objects, and how those ideas carry with them evidence of their objects having been actually perceived, shall be laid before our readers in another place: (see Metaphysics, Part I. chap. ii.) At present we shall throw together some observations on the memory, which, being of a practical rather than of a speculative nature, cannot be admitted into the article where the nature of the faculty itself is discussed.\n\n\"When we remember with little or no effort, it is called remembrance simply, or memory, and sometimes passive memory. When we endeavour to remember, Beattie's what does not immediately (and as it were) of itself Elements occur, it is called active memory, or recollection. A ready recollection of our knowledge, at the moment when we have occasion for it, is a talent of the greatest importance. The man possessed of it seldom fails to distinguish himself in whatever sort of business he may be engaged.\" It is indeed evident, that when the power of retention is weak, all attempts at eminence of knowledge must be vain; for \"memory is the primary and fundamental power,\" without which there could be no other intellectual operation. Judgement and ratiocination suppose something already known, and draw their decisions only from experience. Imagination selects ideas from the treasures of remembrance, and produces novelty only by varied combinations. We do not even form conjectures of distant, or anticipations of future, events, but by concluding what is possible from what is past.\"\n\nOf a faculty so important, many rules have been given for the regulation and improvement; of which the first is, that he who wishes to have a clear and distinct remembrance, should be temperate with respect to eating, drinking, and sleep. The memory depends very much upon the state of the brain; and therefore whatever is hurtful to the latter, must be prejudicial to the former. Too much sleep clouds the brain, and too little overheats it; therefore either of these extremes must of course hurt the memory, and ought carefully to be avoided. Intemperance of all kinds, and excess of passion, have the same ill effects; so that we rarely meet with an intemperate person whose memory is at once clear and tenacious.\n\n\"The liveliest remembrance is not so vivid as the sensation that produced it; and ideas of memory do often, but not always, decay more and more, as the original sensation becomes more and more remote in time. Those sensations and those thoughts have a chance to be long remembered which are lively at first; and those are likely to be most lively which are most attended to, or which are accompanied with pleasure or pain, with wonder, surprise, curiosity, meditation, and other lively passions. The art of memory, therefore, is little more than the art of attention. What we wish to remember we should attend to, so as to understand it perfectly, fixing our view particularly upon its importance or singular nature, 'that it may raise within us some of the passions above mentioned.' We should also disengage our minds from all other things, that we may attend more effectually to the object which we will to remember. No man will read with much advantage who is not able at pleasure to evacuate his mind, or who brings not to his author an intellect defecated and pure, neither turbid with care, nor agitated with pleasure. If the repositories of thought are already full, what can they receive? If the mind is employed on the past or the future, the book will be held before the eyes in vain.\n\n\"It is the practice of many readers, to note in the margin of their books the most important passages.\"\nMemory the strongest arguments; or the brightest sentiments. Thus they load their minds with superfluous attention, reflects the vehemence of curiosity by useless deliberation, and by frequent interruption break the current of narration or the chain of reason, and at last close the volume and forget the passages and the marks together. Others are firmly persuaded, that nothing is certainly remembered but what is transcribed; and they, therefore, pass weeks and months in transferring large quotations to a common place-book. Yet, why any part of a book which can be consulted at pleasure should be copied, we are not able to discover. The hand has no closer correspondence with the memory than the eye. The act of writing itself distracts the thoughts; and what is read twice, is commonly better remembered than what is transcribed. This method, therefore, confuses time, without afflicting the memory. But to write an abridgement of a good book may sometimes be a very profitable exercise. In general, when we would preserve the doctrines, sentiments, or facts, that occur in reading, it will be prudent to lay the book aside, and put them in writing in our own words. This practice will give accuracy to our knowledge, accustom us to recollection, improve us in the use of language, and enable us so thoroughly to comprehend the thoughts of other men, as to make them in some measure our own.\n\n\"Our thoughts have for the most part a connection; so that the thought which is just now in the mind, depends partly upon that which went before, and partly serves to introduce that which follows.\u2014Hence we remember best those things of which the parts are methodically disposed and mutually connected. A regular discourse makes a more lasting impression upon the hearer than a parcel of detached sentences, and gives to his rational powers a more habitual exercise: and this may show us the propriety of conducting our studies, and all our affairs, according to a regular plan or method. When this is not done, our thoughts and our business, especially if in any degree complex, soon run into confusion.\"\n\nAs the mind is not at all times equally disposed for the exercise of this faculty, such seasons should be made choice of as are most proper for it. The mind is seldom fit for attention presently after meals; and to call off the spirits at such times from their proper employment in digestion, is apt to cloud the brain, and prejudice the health. Both the mind and body should be easy and undisturbed when we engage in this exercise, and therefore retirement is most fit for it; and the evening, just before we go to rest, is generally recommended as a very convenient season, both from the stillness of the night, and because the impressions will then have a longer time to settle before they come to be disturbed by the accession of others proceeding from external objects; and to call over in the morning what has been committed to the memory overnight, must, for the same reason, be very serviceable. For, to review those ideas while they continue fresh upon the mind, and unmixed with any others, must necessarily imprint them more deeply.\n\nSome ancient writers speak of an artificial memory, and lay down rules for attaining it. Simonides the poet is said first to have discovered this, or at least to have given the occasion for it. The story they tell of him is this: Being once at a feast, he recited a poem which he had made in honour of the person who gave the entertainment. But having (as is usual in poetry) made a large digression in praise of Caecus and Pollux; when he had repeated the whole poem, his patron would give him but half the sum he had promised, telling him he must get the other part from those deities who had an equal share in the honour of his performance. Immediately after, Simonides was told that two young men were without, and must needs speak with him. He had scarcely got out of the house, when the room where the company was fell down, killed all the persons in it, and so mangled the bodies, that, when the rubbish was thrown off, they could not be known one from another: upon which Simonides recollecting the place where every one had sat, by that means distinguished them. Hence it came to be observed, that to fix a number of places in the mind in a certain order, was a help to the memory: As we find by experience, that, upon returning to places once familiar to us, we not only remember them, but likewise many things we both said and did in them. This action therefore of Simonides was afterwards improved into an art; and the nature of it is this: They bid you form in your mind the idea of some large place or building, which you may divide into a great number of distinct parts, ranged and disposed in a certain order. There you are frequently to revolve in your thoughts, till you are able to run them over one after another without hesitation, beginning at any part. Then you are to impress upon your mind as many images of living creatures, or any other inflexible objects which are most likely to affect you, and be soonest revived in your memory. These, like characters in shorthand, or hieroglyphics, must stand to denote an equal number of other words, which cannot so easily be remembered. When therefore you have a number of things to commit to memory in a certain order, all that you have to do is, to place these images regularly in the several parts of your building. And thus they tell you, that, by going over several parts of the building, the images placed in them will be revived in the mind; which of course will give you the things or words themselves in the order you desire to remember them. The advantage of the image seems to be this; that, as they are more like to affect the imagination than the words for which they stand, they will for that reason be more easily remembered. Thus, for instance, if the image of a lion be made to signify strength, and this word strength be one of those I am to remember, and is placed in the porch; when, in going over the several parts of the building, I come to the porch, I shall sooner be reminded of that image than of the word strength. Of this artificial memory, both Cicero and Quintilian speak; but we know not of any modern orator that has ever made use of it. It seems indeed to have been a laborious way of improving the memory, if it serves that end at all, and fitter for afflicting us to remember any number of unconnected words than a continual discourse, unless so far as the remembrance of one word may enable us to recollect more. It is, however, in allusion to it, that we still call the parts of a discourse places.\nBut, doubtless, the most effectual way to gain a good memory, is by constant and moderate exercise of it; for the memory, like other habits, is strengthened and improved by daily use. It is indeed hardly credible, to what a degree both active and passive remembrance may be improved by long practice. Scaliger reports of himself, that in his youth he could repeat above 100 verses, having once read them; and Bertheus declares, that he wrote his Comment upon Claudian without consulting the text. To hope, however, for such degrees of memory as these, would be equally vain as to hope for the strength of Hercules, or the swiftness of Achilles. \"But there are clergymen who can get a sermon by heart in two hours, though their memory, when they began to exercise it, was rather weak than strong: And pleaders, with other orators who peak in public and extempore, often discover, in calling instantly to mind all the knowledge necessary on the present occasion, and every thing of importance that may have been advanced in the course of a long debate, such powers of retention and recollection as, to the man who has never been obliged to exert himself in the same manner, are altogether astonishing. As habits, in order to be strong, must be formed in early life, the memories of children should, therefore, be constantly exercised; but to oblige them to commit to memory what they do not understand, perverts their faculties, and gives them a dislike to learning.\" In a word, those who have most occasion for memory, as orators and public speakers, should not suffer it to lie idle, but constantly employ it in treasuring up and frequently reviving such things as may be of most importance to them; for by these means it will be more at their command, and they may place greater confidence in it upon any emergency.\n\n\"Men complain of nothing more frequently than of deficient memory; and indeed every one finds, that after all his efforts, many of the ideas which he desired to retain have slipped irretrievably away; that acquisitions of the mind are sometimes equally fugitive with the gifts of fortune; and that a short intermission of attention more certainly lessens knowledge than impairs an estate. To assist this weakness of our nature, many methods besides those which we have mentioned have been proposed; all of which may be justly suspected of being ineffectual: for no art of memory, however its effects may have been boasted or admired, has been ever adopted into general use; nor have those who professed it appeared to excel others in readiness of recollection or multiplicity of attainments.\"\n\nThe reader who is desirous to try the effect of these helps, may have recourse to a treatise entitled A new Method of Artificial Memory; but the true method of memory is attention and exercise.","sp":105,"ep":107},{"h":"MEMPHIS","t":"an ancient city, and the royal residence of the kings in the Higher Egypt; distant from the Delta to the south 15 miles, according to Pliny. Called also Moph, and Noph, in scripture.\n\nThough this city is now so completely ruined, that authors greatly disagree concerning its situation; yet Strabo informs us that in his time it was the most magnificent in Egypt, next to Alexandria. It was called the capital of the country; and there was an entire temple of Osiris, where the Apis or sacred ox was kept and worshipped. In the same place was an apartment of the mother of the ox; a very magnificent temple of Vulcan; a large circus or space for fighting bulls; and a great colossus in the middle of the city, which was thrown down. There was likewise a temple of Venus, and a Serapium in a very sandy place, where the wind heaps up hills of sand very dangerous to travellers; together with a number of sphinxes, the heads of some of them only being visible, the others covered up to the middle of their body. The same author likewise informs us, that in the front of the city there were many lakes; and that it contained a number of palaces, at that time in ruins. These buildings, he said, formerly stood upon an eminence; they lay along the side of the hill, stretching down to the lakes and groves, 40 stadia from the city. There was likewise a mountain in the neighbourhood, on which were a great number of pyramids, with the sepulchres of the kings, among which were three remarkable, and two of them accounted wonders of the world. From this description, Mr Bruce concludes that the celebrated capital of Egypt stood in the place where the villages of Metrahenny are now situated; in opposition to Dr Shaw's opinion, who thinks it was situated at Geeza or Gifa.\n\nM. Savary has also shown, that Gifa was not the situation of the ancient Memphis. This flood, he says, on the western bank of the Nile, on the spot where the village of Memph now stands, which still preserves the name. Large heaps of rubbish are still to be seen there; but the Arabs have transported to Cairo the columns and remarkable stones, which they have disposed, without taste and without order, in their mosques and public buildings. This city extended as far as Saccara; and was almost wholly encompassed by lakes, part of which are still subsiding. It was necessary to cross them to convey the dead to the sepulchre of their fathers. The tombs, hewn out of the rock, were closed up with stones of a proportionable size, and covered with sand. These bodies embalmed with so much care, preserved with so much respect, are torn from the monuments they repose in, and sold without decency to strangers by the inhabitants of Saccara. This place is called the plain of mummies. There too we find the well of the birds, into which one descends by means of a rope. It leads to subterranean galleries, filled with earthen vases containing the sacred birds. They are rarely met with entire, because the Arabs break them in hopes of finding idols of gold. They do not conduct travellers into the places where they have found more precious articles. They even close them up carefully, referring to themselves some secret passages by which they defend. In a journey into Egypt made by the duke Menander de Chaulnes, he advanced very far into these winding labyrinths, sometimes crawling, and sometimes scrambling on his knees. Informed by Mr Edward Worley Montague, who has carefully visited Egypt, he arrived at one of those passages which had an opening shut up from without by branches of the date tree interwoven, and covered with sand. He remarked there some hieroglyphics in relief, executed in the highest perfection. But the Arabs refused every offer he made them to permit him to take drawings of them, or to mould them, in order to preserve their form. The duke de Chaulnes is of opinion that these hieroglyphics, sculptured with so much art that the objects they represent may be discovered at the first sight, might possibly furnish the key of the others, whose contours are simply expressed, and form a sort of alphabet of this unintelligible language. Several pyramids are distinguishable along the mountains which bound Saccara on the west, the greatest part of which appear as lofty as those of Gifa.

His happiness in introducing the new comedy, and refining an art which had been so gross and licentious in former times, quickly spread his name over the world. Pliny informs us, that the kings of Egypt and Macedon gave a noble testimony of his merit, by sending ambassadors to invite him to their courts, and even fleets to bring him over; but that Menander was so much of a philosopher, as to prefer the free enjoyment of his studies to the promised favours of the great. Of his works, which amounted to above 100 comedies, we have had a double loss, the originals being not only vanished, but the greatest part of them, when copied by Terence, having unfortunately perished by shipwreck before they saw Rome. Yet the four plays which Terence borrowed from him before that accident happened, are still preserved in the Roman habit; and it is chiefly from Terence that most people form their judgement of Menander, the fragments that remain of him not being sufficient to enable them to do it. The ancients have paid high things of Menander; and we find the old masters of rhetoric recommending his works as the true patterns of every beauty and every grace of public speaking. Quintilian declares, that a careful imitation of Menander only, will satisfy all the rules he has laid down in his institutions. It is in Menander that he would have his orator search for a copiousness of invention, for a happy elegance of expression, and especially for that universal genius which is able to accommodate itself to persons, things, and affections.\u2014But Julius Caesar has left the loftiest as well as the justest praise of Menander's works, when he calls Terence only a Half-Menander. For while the virtues of the Latin poet are so deservedly admired, it is impossible we should raise a higher notion of excellency than to conceive the great original still shining with half its lustre unreflected, and preserving an equal part of its graces, above the power of the best copier in the world.

In consequence of this excellent work, he was styled the Jewish Socrates by some of the periodical writers; but he wanted the firmness and courage of the Grecian philosopher. His timidity, and even pusillanimity, defects too common in speculative men, prevented him from being of any essential service to his nation; of which he might have become the benefactor by being the reformer. The pliancy of his character, his soft, modest, and obliging disposition, gained him the esteem alike of the superstitious and of the incredulous. After all, he could never procure admission to the Berlin society, or to the conveivation of the king of Prussia. At his death he received from his nation those honours which are commonly paid to their first rabbins. Contrary to an imprudent custom prevalent among the Jews of burying their dead before sunset, his interment was delayed till 24 hours after he expired. Though Mendelsion was descended from a respectable family, he was very poor. In early life he entered into a counting-house of his own nation, wherein he greatly recommended himself by his capacity and integrity in business: But philosophy and literature soon became his principal occupation; and to the famous Lessing he was indebted for counsels which, without diverting his attention from those pursuits that were necessary to his subsistence, accelerated his progress in his literary career. Even after the death of his benefactor, Mendelsion retained for him the sincerest regard and the most lively gratitude. Notwithstanding the very strict regimen which he observed, he survived him only a few years; for his feeble frame and weak constitution were gradually and insensibly undermined by intense application to study.","sp":109,"ep":109},{"h":"MENDEZ PINTO","t":"FERDINAND, was born at Montemor-o-Velho in Portugal, and was at first servant to a Portuguese gentleman. In expectation of making a fortune, he embarked for India in 1537. His vessel being taken by the Turks on his passage, he was carried to Mocka, and sold to a Greek renegade, and afterwards to a Jew, in whose possession he continued till he was redeemed by the governor of Ormus, a Portuguese fort. The governor procured him an opportunity of going out to India, agreeable to his first design. During a residence of twenty-one years in that country, he was witness to very important transactions, and experienced many singular adventures. He returned to Portugal in 1558, where he enjoyed the reward\nward of his labours, after having been thirteen times a slave and sixteen times sold. A very curious account of his travels was written by himself, and published at Lisbon, A.D. 1614, in folio. This work was translated into French by Bernard Figuier, a Portuguese gentleman, and printed at Paris 1645, in 4to. It is written in a very interesting manner, and in a style more elegant than might have been expected from a man whose whole life was spent in the camp and in slavery. It elucidates a great variety of particulars relating to the geography, history, and manners of the inhabitants of China, Japan, Pegu, Siam, Achem, Java, &c.

Innocent III. was the first of the popes who perceived the necessity of instituting such an order; and accordingly he gave such monastic societies, as made a pretension of poverty, the most distinguishing marks of his protection and favour. They were also encouraged and patronized by the succeeding pontiffs, when experience had demonstrated their public and extensive usefulness. But when it became generally known, that they had such a peculiar place in the esteem and protection of the rulers of the church, their number grew to such an enormous and unwieldy multitude, and swarmed so prodigiously in all the European provinces, that they became a burden, not only to the people, but to the church itself. The great inconvenience that arose from the excessive multiplication of the mendicant orders was remedied by Gregory X. in a general council, which he assembled at Lyons in 1272. For here all the religious orders that had sprung up after the council held at Rome in 1215, under the pontificate of Innocent III. were suppressed; and the extravagant multitude of mendicants, as Gregory called them, were reduced to a smaller number, and confined to the four following societies or denominations, viz. the Dominicans, the Franciscans, the Carmelites, and the Augustins or hermits of St. Augustine.\n\nAs the pontiffs allowed these four mendicant orders the liberty of travelling wherever they thought proper, of conversing with persons of every rank, of instructing the youth and multitude wherever they went; and as those monks exhibited, in their outward appearance and manner of life, more striking marks of gravity and holiness than were observable in the other monastic societies, they rose all at once to the very summit of fame, and were regarded with the utmost esteem and veneration through all the countries of Europe. The enthusiastic attachment to these sanctimonious beggars went so far, that, as we learn from the most authentic records, several cities were divided or cantoned out into four parts, with a view to these four orders; the first part being assigned to the Dominicans, the second to the Franciscans, the third to the Carmelites, and the fourth to the Augustins. The people were unwilling to receive the sacraments from any other hands than those of the mendicants, to whose churches they crowded to perform their devotions, while living, and were extremely delirious to depose there also their remains after death: nor did the influence and credit of the mendicants end here; for we find in the history of this and of the succeeding ages, that they were employed, not only in spiritual matters, but also in temporal and political affairs of the greatest consequence, in composing the differences of princes, concluding treaties of peace, concerting alliances, presiding in cabinet councils, governing courts, levying taxes, and other occupations, not only remote from, but absolutely inconsistent with, the monastic character and profession. However, the power of the Dominicans and Franciscans greatly surpassed that of the other two orders: in much that these two orders were, before the Reformation, what the Jesuits have been since that happy and glorious period, the very soul of the hierarchy, the engines of the state, the secret springs of all the motions of the one and the other, and the authors and directors of every great and important event, both in the religious and political world. By very quick progression their pride and confidence arrived at such a pitch, that they had the presumption to declare publicly, that they had a divine impulse and commission to illustrate and maintain the religion of Jesus; they treated with the utmost insolence and contempt all the different orders of the priesthood; they affirmed, without a blush, that the true method of obtaining salvation was revealed to them alone; proclaimed, with ostentation, the superior efficacy and virtue of their indulgencies; and vaunted beyond measure their interest at the court of heaven, and their familiar connexions with the Supreme Being, the Virgin Mary, and the saints in glory. By these impious wiles, they so deluded and captivated the miserable, and blinded the multitude, that they would not intrust any other but the mendicants with the care of their souls. They retained their credit and influence to such a degree, towards the close of the 14th century, that great numbers of both sexes, some in health, others in a state of infirmity, and others at the point of death, earnestly desired to be admitted into the mendicant order, which they looked upon as a sure and infallible method of rendering heaven propitious. Many made it an essential part of their last wills, that their bodies after death should be wrapped in old ragged Dominican or Franciscan habits, and interred among the mendicants. For such was the barbarous superstition and wretched ignorance of this age, that people universally believed they should readily obtain mercy from Christ, at the day of judgement, if they appeared before his tribunal associated with the mendicant friars.\n\nAbout this time, however, they fell under an universal odium; but being resolutely protected against all opposition, whether open or secret, by the popes, who regarded them as their best friends and most effectual supports, they suffered little or nothing from the efforts of their numerous adversaries. In the 15th century,\ncentury, besides their arrogance, which was excessive, a quarrelsome and litigious spirit prevailed among them, and drew upon them justly the displeasure and indignation of many. By affording refuge at this time to the Beguins in their order, they became offensive to the bishops, and were hereby involved in difficulties and perplexities of various kinds. They lost their credit in the 16th century by their rustic impudence, their ridiculous superstitions, their ignorance, cruelty, and brutish manners. They discovered the most barbarous aversion to the arts and sciences, and expressed a like abhorrence of certain eminent and learned men, who endeavoured to open the paths of science to the pursuits of the studious youth, recommended the culture of the mind, and attacked the barbarism of the age in their writings and discourses. Their general character, together with other circumstances, concurred to render a reformation desirable, and to accomplish this happy event.\n\nAmong the number of mendicants are also ranked the Capuchins, Recollets, Minims, and others, who are branches or derivations from the former.\n\nBuchanan tells us, the mendicants in Scotland, under an appearance of beggary, lived a very luxurious life; whence one wittily called them, not Mendicant but Monducati friars.","sp":110,"ep":111},{"h":"MENECRATES","t":"a physician of Syracuse, who flourished about 365 B.C. is famous for his skill in his profession, but much more for his vanity.

The writings of Menno, which are almost all composed in the Dutch language, were published in folio at Amsterdam in the year 1651. About the year 1627, Menno was earnestly solicited by many of the sect with which he connected himself, to assume among them the rank and functions of a public teacher; and as he looked upon the persons who made this proposal to be exempt from the fanatical frenzy of their brethren at Munster (though according to other accounts they were originally of the same stamp, only rendered somewhat wiser by their sufferings), he yielded to their entreaties. From this period to the end of his life, he travelled from one country to another with his wife and children, exercising his ministry, under persecutions and calamities of various kinds, that succeeded each other without interruption, and constantly exposed to the danger of falling a victim to the severity of the laws. East and West Friesland, together with the province of Groningen, were first visited by this zealous apostle of the Anabaptists; from whence he directed his course into Holland, Guelderland, Brabant, and Westphalia, continued it through the German provinces that lie on the coasts of the Baltic sea, and penetrated as far as Livonia. In all these places his ministerial labours were attended with remarkable success, and added to his sect a prodigious number of followers. Hence he is deservedly considered as the common chief of almost all the Anabaptists, and the parent of the sect that still subsists under that denomination. Menno was a man of genius, undirected by a very sound judgment; he possessed a natural and persuasive eloquence, and such a degree of learning as made him pass for an oracle in the estimation of the multitude. He appears, moreover, to have been a man of probity, of a meek and tractable spirit, gentle in his manners, pliable and obsequious in his commerce with persons of all ranks and characters, and extremely zealous in promoting practical religion and virtue, which he recommended by his example as well as by his precepts. The plan of doctrine and discipline drawn up by Menno was of a much more mild and moderate nature than that of the furious and fanatical Anabaptists, whose tumultuous proceedings have been recited under that article, but somewhat more severe, though more clear and confident, than the doctrine of the wiser branches of that sect, who aimed at nothing more than the restoration of the Christian church to its primitive purity. Accordingly he condemned the plan of ecclesiastical discipline that was founded on the prospect of a new kingdom, to be miraculously established by Jesus Christ on the ruins of civil government and the destruction of human rulers, and which had been the fatal and pestilential source of such dreadful commotions, such execrable rebellions, and such enormous crimes. He declared publicly his dislike of that doctrine, which pointed out the approach of a marvellous reformation in the church by the means of a new and extraordinary effusion of the Holy Spirit. He expressed his abhorrence of the licentious tenets, which several of the Anabaptists had maintained, with respect to the unlawfulness of polygamy and divorce; and finally, considered as unworthy of toleration those fanatics who were of opinion that the Holy Ghost continued to descend into the minds of many chosen believers, in as extraordinary a manner as he did at the first establishment of the Christian church, and that he testified this peculiar presence to several of the faithful by miracles, predictions, dreams, and visions of various kinds. He retained indeed the doctrines commonly received among the Anabaptists, in relation to the baptism of infants, the millennium, or 1000 years reign of Christ upon earth, the exclusion of magistrates from the Christian church, the abolition of war, and the prohibition of oaths enjoined by our Saviour, and the vanity as well as the pernicious effects of human science. But while Menno retained these doctrines in a general sense, he explained and modified them in such a manner as made them resemble the religious tenets that were universally received in the Protestant churches; and this rendered them agreeable to many, and made them appear inoffensive even to numbers who had no inclination to embrace them. It however so happened, that the nature of the doctrines considered in themselves, the eloquence of Menno which set them off to such advantage, and the circumstances of the times, gave a high degree of credit to the religious system of this famous teacher among the Anabaptists, so that it made a rapid progress in that sect. And thus it was in consequence of the ministry of Menno, that the different sorts of Anabaptists agreed together in excluding from their communion the fanatics that dishonoured it, and in renouncing all tenets that were detrimental to the authority of civil government, and by an unexpected coalition formed themselves into one community.\n\nThough the Mennonites usually pass for a sect of Anabaptists, yet M. Herman Schyn, a Mennonite minister, who has published their history and apology, maintains, that they are not Anabaptists either in principle or by origin. However, nothing can be more certain than this fact, viz. that the first Mennonite congregations were composed of the different sorts of Anabaptists, of those who had been always inoffensive and upright, and of those who, before their conversion by the ministry of Menno, had been factious fanatics; besides, it is alleged, that the Mennonites,\nMEN\n\nThe Mennonites do actually retain, at this day, some of their opinions and doctrines, which led the sedulous and turbulent Anabaptists of old to the commission of so many and such enormous crimes; such particularly is the doctrine concerning the nature of Christ's kingdom, or of the church of the New Testament, though modified in such a manner as to have lost its noxious qualities, and to be no longer pernicious in its influence.\n\nThe Mennonites are subdivided into several sects; whereof the two principal are the Flandrians or Flemings, and the Waterlandians. The opinions, says Molheim, that are held in common by the Mennonites, seem to be all derived from this fundamental principle, that the kingdom which Christ established upon earth is a visible church or community, into which the holy and just alone are to be admitted, and which is consequently exempt from all those institutions and rules of discipline that have been invented by human wisdom, for the correction and reformation of the wicked. This principle, indeed, was avowed by the ancient Mennonites, but it is now almost wholly renounced: nevertheless, from this ancient doctrine, many of the religious opinions that distinguish the Mennonites from all other Christian communities, seem to be derived: in consequence of this doctrine, they admit none to the sacrament of baptism but persons that are come to the full use of their reason; they neither admit civil rulers into their communion, nor allow any of their members to perform the functions of magistracy; they deny the lawfulness of repelling force by force, and consider war, in all its shapes, as unchristian and unjust; they entertain the utmost aversion to the execution of justice, and more especially to capital punishments; and they also refuse to confirm their testimony by an oath. The particular sentiments that divided the more considerable societies of the Mennonites are the following: The rigid Mennonites, called the Flemings, maintain with various degrees of rigour, the opinions of their founder Menno, as to the human nature of Christ, alleging that it was produced in the womb of the Virgin by the creating power of the Holy Ghost; the obligation that binds us to wash the feet of strangers, in consequence of our Saviour's command; the necessity of excommunicating and avoiding, as one would do the plague, not only avowed sinners, but also all those who depart, even in some light instances pertaining to dress, &c., from the simplicity of their ancestors; the contempt due to human learning, and other matters of less moment. However this austere system declines, and the rigid Mennonites are gradually approaching towards the opinions and discipline of the more moderate or Waterlandians.\n\nThe first settlement of the Mennonites, in the United Provinces, was granted them by William prince of Orange, towards the close of the 16th century; but it was not before the following century that their liberty and tranquillity were fixed upon solid foundations, when, by a confession of faith published in the year 1626, they cleared themselves from the imputations of those pernicious and detestable errors that had been laid to their charge. In order to appease their intestine discords, a considerable part of the Anabaptists of Flanders, Germany, and Friesland, concluded their debates in a conference held at Amsterdam, in the year 1630, and entered into the bonds of fraternal communion, each referring to themselves a liberty of retaining certain opinions. This association was renewed and confirmed by new resolutions, in the year 1649; in consequence of which the rigorous laws of Menno and his successors were, in various respects, mitigated and corrected.","sp":111,"ep":113},{"h":"MENOLOGY","t":"MENOLOGIUM, (from \u03bc\u03ae\u03bd, month, and \u1f00\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03ac, assembly), is much the same as martyrology, or calendar, in the Latin.\n\nThe Greek menologium is divided into the several months in the year; and contains an abridgment of the lives of the saints, with a bare enumeration of the names of such whose lives were never written.

And it is to this limited view of the subject that we propose to confine our attention in the present treatise. In general, it will only be necessary to give the practical rules, as we have already explained their foundation when treating of GEOMETRY, CONIC SECTIONS, and FLUXIONS; but, in addition to the rules, in a few instances, we shall give their demonstrations.\n\nIn all practical applications of mathematics it is necessary to express magnitudes of every kind by numbers.

There are three objects A, B, C, whose distances abeam are known to be as follows; namely, from A to B 1063, from A to C 202, and from B to C 131 fathoms. Now to determine the distance of D a fourth object, or station, from each of the other three, the angle ADB was measured with a theodolite, or other suitable instrument; and found to be 13\u00b0 30', and the angle CDB was found 29\u00b0 50'. Hence it is required to determine the distances DA, DB and DC, supposing DB the least of the three.\n\nLet a circle be described about the points A, D and C; and let DB be produced to meet the circle again in E, and draw AE, CE.\n\nIn the triangle ABC there are given the side AC = 202 fathoms, the angle ACE (= ADE, GEOM. Sect. II. Theor. 15.) = 13\u00b0 30', and the angle CAE (= CDE) = 29\u00b0 50'. Hence (by Trigon.) we shall have AE = 68.716 fathoms.\n\nIn the triangle ABC, all its sides are given, and hence the angle BAC will be found = 35\u00b0 35' 54\"; to this add the angle CAE, and the sum is the angle EAB = 65\u00b0 25' 54\".\n\nIn the triangle ABE, we have given AB = 106.5, AE = 68.716, the angle BAE = 65\u00b0 25' 54\"; hence we shall have the angle ABE = 38\u00b0 43' 44\", and the angle AEB = 75\u00b0 51' 25\".\n\nIn the triangle ADE we have the side AE = 68.716, the angle ADE = 13\u00b0 30', and the angle AED = 75\u00b0 51' 25\". Hence we have AD = 285.43 fathoms, which is one of the distances required.\n\nIn the triangle ABD we have AB = 106.5, the angle ADB = 13\u00b0 30', the angle DAB (= ABE - ADB) = 25\u00b0 13' 45\". Hence BD, another of the distances sought, will be found = 194.45 fathoms.\n\nLastly, In the triangle ADC, there is given AC = 202, the angle ADC (= ADB + BDC) = 43\u00b0 20', Of Right the angle DCA (= DEA) = 75\u00b0 15' 25\". Hence we get DC = 236.97 fathoms, which is the remaining distance sought.\n\nEx. 8. From a ship at sea a point of land was observed to bear E. by S. and after sailing N. E. 12 miles, the same point was found to bear S. E. by E. How far was the last observation made from the point of land?\n\nLet A be the first position of the ship, B the second, and C the point of land. In the triangle ABC we have given the angle A = 5 points or 56\u00b0 15', the angle B = 2 points, or 10\u00b0 15', and the angle C = 2 points or 22\u00b0 30'. Also the side AB = 12 miles. Hence (by Trigon.) the side BC is readily found to be 26.073 miles.\n\nThere are various other instruments and methods by which the heights or distances of objects may be found. One of the most simple instruments, both in respect of its construction and application, is a square, ABCD, made of some solid material, and furnished with two sights on AB, one of its edges, and a plummet fastened to A, one of its angles, and having the two sides BC, CD, which contain the opposite angle divided into 100, or 1000 equal parts.\n\nTo measure any altitude HK with this instrument. Fig. 13.\n\nLet it be held in such a position that K, the top of the object may be seen through the sights on its edge AB, while its plane is perpendicular to the horizon; then the plummet will cut off from the square a triangle similar to that formed by the horizontal line AI, the vertical line IK, and the line AK drawn from the eye to the top of the object.\n\nIf the line of the plummet passes through D the opposite angle of the square, then the height KI will be equal to AI, the distance of the eye from the vertical line to be measured. If it meet AD, the side of the square next the eye, in some point E between A and D, then the triangles ABE, AIK being similar, and the angle ABE equal to the angle AKI, we have \\( \\frac{AB}{AE} : \\frac{AI}{IK} \\). Let us now suppose AD = AB to be divided into 1000 equal parts; then the length of AE will be expressed by a certain number of these parts; thus the proportion of AE to AB, and consequently that of AI to IK will be given; therefore if AI be determined by actual measurement, we may from the above proportion immediately find IK.\n\nIf again the line of the plummet meet DC the side of the square opposite to the sights in F, then, in the similar triangles AJK, BCF, the angle AKI is equal to BFC thus we have BC : CF :: AI : IK. Hence IK is determined as before, and in each case by adding HI the height of the eye, we shall have HK the whole height required.","sp":116,"ep":117},{"h":"MENSURATION","t":"RULE I.\n\nMultiply the length by the perpendicular breadth, and the product will be the area.\n\nThis rule is demonstrated in GEOMETRY, Sect.

But it may be proved in a more elementary manner by means of the following axiom. If two solids be contained between two parallel planes; and if the sections of these solids by a third plane parallel to the other two, at any altitude, be always equal to one another, then the solids themselves are equal. Or more generally thus. If two solids between two parallel planes be such, that any sections of them by a third plane parallel to the other two have always to each other the same given ratio, then the solids themselves are to one another in that ratio.\n\nWe have given this proposition in the form of an axiom for the sake of brevity, but its truth may be strictly demonstrated, as has been done when treating of pyramids and the sphere, in GEOMETRY, Sect. 8. and 9.\n\nLet us now suppose ABE to be a quadrant; C the centre of the circle; AFEC a square described about the quadrant; and CF the diagonal of the square. Suppose the figures to revolve about AC as an axis, then the quadrant will generate a hemisphere, the triangle ACF will generate a cone, and the square AE a cylinder. Let these three solids be cut by a plane perpendicular to the axis, and meeting the plane of the square, in the line DHHG; and join CB. Then, because CDB is a right-angled triangle, a circle described with CB as a radius is equal to two circles described with CD and DB as radii (GEOMETRY, Sect. VI. Prop. 4. Cor. 2.). But CB = DG; and since CA = AF, therefore CD = DH; therefore the circle described with the radius DG, is equal to the sum of the circles described with the radii DH, DB; that is, the section of the cylinder at any altitude, is equal to the corresponding sections of the sphere and cone taken together. Consequently, by the foregoing axiom, the cylinder is equal to the hemisphere and cone taken together, and also the segment of the cylinder between the planes AF, DG is equal to the sum of the segments of the hemisphere and cone contained between the same planes. Put 2CE, or 2AF, the diameter of the circle, = \\( d \\), and AD, the height of the spherical segment, = \\( h \\). Then AC = \\( \\frac{1}{2}d \\) and \\( 2CA = 2AD = 2CD = d - 2h \\). Let \\( n \\) denote the number .7854. Then the area of the base common to the conic frustum AH, and cylinder AG, is \\( nd^2 \\) (Sect. II. Prob. 10.), and the area of the top of the frustum is \\( n(d - 2h)^2 \\), and the mean proportional between these areas is \\( n(d - 2h)d \\).

Therefore the solid content of the spherical segment, (which is equal to the difference between the cylinder AG and conic frustum AH) is equal to\n\n\\[\nn^2d^2h - \\left( nd^2h - 2nd^2h + \\frac{4}{3}n^2h^3 \\right),\n\\]\n\nthat is, to \\( 2nd^2h - \\frac{4}{3}n^2h^3 \\), or to\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} \\left( 3d - 2h \\right) h^3,\n\\]\n\nwhich expression, if it be considered that \\( \\frac{2}{3}n \\) or \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times .7854 \\) is equal to .5236, is evidently the same as that given by the rule.\n\nExample. In a sphere whose diameter is 21, what is the solidity of a segment whose height is 4.5 inches?\n\nFirst \\( 3 \\times 21 - 2 \\times 4.5 = 54 \\).\n\nThen \\( 54 \\times 4.5 \\times 4.5 \\times .5236 = 572.5566 \\) inches, the solidity required.\n\nProblem X.\nTo find the solid content of a paraboloid, or solid, produced by the rotation of a parabola about its axis.\n\nRule.\nMultiply the area of the base by the height, and take half the product for the content.\n\nTo demonstrate this rule, let AGC and BHD be two equal semi-parabolas lying in contrary directions, and having their vertices at the extremity of the line AB. Let AD, BC be ordinates to the curves. Complete the rectangle ABCD, and conceive it to revolve about AB as an axis; then the rectangle will generate a cylinder, the radius of whose base will be AD, and the two semi-parabolas will generate two equal paraboloids having the same base and altitude as the cylinder. Let a plane be drawn perpendicular to the axis, and let FHGE be the common section of this plane and the generating...\nLet \\( P \\) denote the parameter of the axis. Then since\n\n\\[\nEG^2 = P \\times AE,\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nEH^2 = P \\times EB,\n\\]\n\n\\[\nEG^2 + EH^2 = P \\times AB = CB^2.\n\\]\n\nHence it appears, as in the demonstration of the preceding rule, that of the solids described by ADCB, ACB, ADB between the same parallel planes, the section of the cylinder at any altitude is equal to the corresponding sections of the paraboloids taken together. Consequently (by the Axiom) the cylinder is equal to both the paraboloids taken together; hence each is half a cylinder of the same base and altitude agreeing with the rule.\n\nThe same thing is also proved in Fluxions, \u00a7 163.\n\n**Example.** If the diameter of the base of a paraboloid be 10 and its height 12 feet; what is its content?\n\nHere \\( 10 \\times 7.854 = 78.54 \\) the area of the base.\n\nAnd \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 7.854 \\times 12 = 47.124 \\) cub. feet is the solidity.\n\n---\n\n**Problem X.**\n\nTo find the solid content of a frustum of a paraboloid.\n\n**Rule.**\n\nAdd together the areas of the circular ends, then multiply that sum by the height of the frustum, and take half the product for its solid content.\n\nTo prove this rule put \\( A \\) and \\( a \\) for the greater and lesser ends of the frustum, and \\( h \\) for its height; also let \\( c \\) denote the height of the portion cut off from the complete paraboloid, so as to form the frustum. Then, by the last problem, the content of the complete paraboloid is \\( \\frac{1}{3} A(A + c) \\), and the content of the part cut off is \\( \\frac{1}{3} ac \\); therefore the content of the frustum is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\left( A(A + c) - ac \\right) = \\frac{1}{3} A(A + c) - \\frac{1}{3} ac.\n\\]\n\nBut from the nature of the parabola, \\( c : h + c :: a : A \\); hence \\( Ac = ab + ac \\) and \\( c = \\frac{ah}{A-a} \\).\n\nLet this value of \\( c \\) be substituted instead of it in the above expression for the content of the frustum, and it becomes\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}(A(A + a)) = \\frac{1}{3}h(A + a),\n\\]\n\nand hence is derived the rule.\n\n**Example.** Required the solidity of the frustum of a paraboloid, the diameter of the greater end being 58, and that of the lesser end 30, and the height 18.\n\nFirst, (by Prob. 10, Sect.

It lies on the banks of the river Maine, between the electorate of Trier on the west, the Palatinate on the south, Franconia on the east, and the Wetterau on the north. It is about 60 miles in length from north-east to south-west, and about 50 in breadth. A considerable part of the elector's revenue arises from the toll on the Rhine and Maine, and from the tax on the excellent wines produced in this country. The chief towns of any trade are, 1. Mentz; (see the next article.) In its neighbourhood is Hockheim, so celebrated for good wines, that the best Rhenish is from thence called old hock. It is a pretty village; containing about 300 families; and belongs to the chapter of Mentz, the dean of which enjoys the revenue of it: in a good year he makes from twelve to fifteen thousand guilders of his wine. He and the Augustins of Mentz and Francfort have the exclusive enjoyment of the best Hockheimer wine, of which, in good years, a piece, consisting of 100 measures, sells for from 900 to 1000 guilders from the press. \"This (says the Baron Riesbeck) is certainly one of the dearest wines in the world. Having a desire to taste it on the spot, we were obliged to pay a rixdollar; it was, however, of the best vintage in this century, viz. that of 1766. Nor should we have had it, but for an advocate of Mentz, to whom the hostels meant to shew favour. This was the first German wine I had met with which was entirely without any four taste: it was quite a perfume to the tongue; whereas the other wine of Hockheim, let it be as good as it may, is not quite clear of vinegar; though for this also, if it has any age, you are forced to pay a guilder and a half.\" 2. Bingen is a pleasant town, which stands in the district called Rhinegau. This town, which, together with the toll on the Rhine, is worth about 30,000 guilders, belongs to the chapter of Mentz, is extremely beautiful, and contains about 4500 inhabitants. A great part of the corn which is carried into the Rhinegau from the neighbouring Palatinate, comes through this place, which, on the other hand, supplies the Palatinate with drugs, and various foreign commodities. This traffic alone would make the place very lively; but, besides this, it has very fruitful vineyards. The hill, at the foot of which it lies, and one side of which is made by the gullet through which the Nahe runs into the Rhine, forms another steep rock behind this gullet parallel to the Rhine and the golden Rudelheimer mountain; it therefore enjoys the same sun as this does, which makes the Budelfheimer wine that grows on it little inferior to the Rudelheimer. See RUDELSHEIM. The rising grounds about it produce wines that are esteemed preferable to those of Baccharac, so much in vogue heretofore.\u20143. Elfeld, five miles west from Mentz, is a strong fortified town, on the north side of the Rhine, and the chief of the Rhinegau.\u2014Here is Rudelheim, a place noted for the growth of the best wines in these parts. 4. Weibaden lies between six and seven leagues from Francfort, and about five or six miles north of Mentz; it is the metropolis of a country belonging to the branch of Naflau-Saarbrak, and is famous for its mineral waters.\n\nAccording to Riesbeck, the fee of Mentz is indebted for its increase of riches to St Boniface, who may be called, with great justice, the apostle of the Germans. It was this man, an Englishman by birth, who in the time of Charlemagne baptized Witikini and the other brave Saxons who had so long refused baptism with their swords, and spread the empire of the vicar of Jesus Christ as far as the northern and eastern seas. He it was who introduced the Roman liturgy into Germany, and made the savage inhabitants abstain from eating horse's flesh. He raised the papal power to a higher pitch than it had been raised in any other country in Christendom; and, in recompense of his services, the pope made all the newly founded bishoprics in the north of Germany subject to the see of Mentz, which Boniface\nMentz face had chosen for his residence. The provinces, the most considerable in the whole papal dominions, all Suabia, Franconia, Bohemia, and almost all Saxony, with a part of Switzerland, Bavaria, and the Upper Rhine, belong to this diocese. Though the reformation, and revenge of the kings of Bohemia, have lessened it one-third, it still contains the archbishopric of Sprengel, and eleven bishoprics, most of which are the most considerable of Germany, as Wurzburg, Paderborn, Hildeheim, Augsburg, &c. When the building of the papal monarchy was completed by Gregory VII., the archbishops of Mentz became powerful enough to be at the head of the empire. In the 13th and 14th centuries, they were so eminent as to be able to make emperors without any foreign alliance; and it was to one of them that the house of Hapburg was indebted for its first elevation. Since the boundaries of the two powers have been more accurately ascertained, and the temporal has so much got the better of the spiritual, the power and influence of the archbishops of this place have of course been much reduced; still, however, they are possessed of very important prerogatives, which they might exert with much more efficacy than they do, were it not that various circumstances have rendered them too dependent on the emperors. They are still the speakers in the electoral college, have the appointment of the diets under the emperors, and may order a re-examination of the proceedings of the imperial courts. These high privileges are, however, too much subject to the control of the house of Austria; nor are their spiritual powers any longer what they once were. Their suffragan bishops have taken it into their heads that all bishops are alike as to power, and that the title of archbishop only entitles its possessor to the first place amongst brothers who are equal. The temporals, however, which are still annexed to this chair, make him who sits in it rich amends for the diminution of his spiritual and political splendor. Though he does not absolutely possess the largest, yet he certainly has the richest and most peopled domain of any ecclesiastical potentate in Germany. The country, it is true, does not contain more than 125 German miles square, whereas the archbishopric of Salzburg contains 240; but then Salzburg has only 250,000 inhabitants, whereas Mentz has 320,000. The natural riches of the territory of Mentz, and its advantageous situation, make a subject of Mentz much richer than one of Salzburg, the greatest part of which is only inhabited by herdsmen. In the territory of Mentz there are 40 cities; in that of Salzburg only seven. The tax on vellots which go down the Rhine of itself produces 60,000 guilders, or 6000l. a-year, which is nearly as much as all the mines of Salzburg put together, excepting only the salt mine at Halle. The tax on wine, here and in the country round, produces the court above 100,000 guilders, or 10,000l. a-year, in which sum we do not reckon the customs of the countries which lie at a greater distance. Upon the whole, the income of the present archbishop may be valued at 1,700,000 guilders, or 170,000l.\n\nIf the lands of the elector lay all together, they would produce a sufficiency of corn and all the prime necessaries of life; but as several parts of them lie wide afield, the people are compelled to purchase a great deal from foreigners. The capital itself, as well as the adjacent Rhinegau, depends on the Palatinate for its corn, notwithstanding the great abundance of that and every other species of grain in its own possessions in Wetterau. The noblest production of the elector's territory on the Rhine is the wine, which is almost the only true Rhenish. Connoisseurs, indeed, allow the wines of Neirittein, Baccarach, and a very few other places out of this country, to be true Rhenish; but they do not give this name to the wines of the Palatinate, of Bardon, and of Altatia. There is a great deal of wine made in the countries which lie on the south and west of the Rhine, at Laubenheim, Bodenheim, Budenheim, and Bingen; but the true Rhenish, that which inspires so many who are and so many who are not poets, comes only from the Rhinegau, which lies on the northern banks of the Rhine. See Rhinegau.\n\nThe civil list of the archbishop (according to Baron Riesbeck), is by much too immoderate and expensive. \"He has his ministers, his counsellors of state, and eighty or ninety privy counsellors of various denominations. The expense of this establishment is very disproportionate to the revenue of the state. This is owing to the large number of poor nobility, who can only accept of employments of this kind. Ignorance of the true principles of government are the causes of this evil. The consequences are, that a great number of persons, who might be usefully employed, live in idleness. Even the military establishment of the country appears to me more calculated for the purpose of feeding a hungry nobility than for real use. At the accession of the present elector, though the whole army only consisted of 2200 men, there were six generals. The regular establishment paid for and supported by the country is 8000 men; but though there are only 2000 men kept up, the money expended for their support, particularly that given to numberless useless officers, might be made use of more for the benefit of the country. The army of the archbishop consists of a German guard of 50 men and 25 horses, a Swiss guard, a squadron of hussars of 130 men (the most useful troops, as they purge the land of robbers and murderers), a corps of artillery of 104 men, three regiments of infantry of 600 men each, and some companies belonging to the armies of Franconia and the Upper Palatinate. Of the fortifications of the capital we may say much the same as of the army. Were they, indeed, improved and kept up as they ought to be, they would vie with Luxemburg, and be the most powerful of all the barriers against France. It is true, that the nature of the ground does not allow of a regular plan; but for single parts, I have seen no place of the same capabilities, where greater advantages have been taken of the ground for the erection of the several works. The beauty, as well as size of them, is indeed an object of great wonder; but though the circle of the Upper Rhine, and even the empire in general, has laid out great sums on the building these fortifications, parts of them are not finished, and parts of them are ready to fall to pieces. Their extent, indeed, would require a great army to man them. But this, as well as the maintaining and keeping them up, is evidently beyond the power of this court, or indeed of the whole circle of\nof the Upper Rhine united. They are, therefore, also to be looked upon as one of the things which serve more for magnificence than real use.\"\n\nMentz, a considerable town of Germany, in the circle of the Lower Rhine, and capital of the electorate of the same name, is situated on the Rhine near its confluence with the Maine, 20 miles north west of Worms, 15 west of Frankfort, and 75 east of Trier, in E. Long. 8\u00b0 20' N. Lat. 49\u00b0 51'. This city claims a right to the invention of the art of printing: (see History of Printing). Here is a very beautiful quay along the river, defended by several works well fortified with cannon. That part of the city which extends towards the river is most populous. The best vineyards for Rhenish wine being in this neighbourhood, Mentz has a flourishing trade in that commodity more particularly; and its commerce is the brisker, by reason that all the merchandise which passes up and down the Rhine stops in its harbour to change bottoms.\n\nThe northern part of the city, in which the archbishop resides, is full of very regular buildings. Here are three regular streets, called the Bleichen, which run parallel to each other from the banks of the Rhine to 600 yards within the city, and are cut almost regularly by very pretty cross streets. The archbishop's palace has a most commanding view of these streets, the Rhine, and the Rhinegaun. There are also some good buildings in the old part of the city. The market of beasts is extremely well worth seeing; and you here and there meet with other agreeable spots. The market in the middle of the town, though not regular, is one of the prettiest places in Germany. The cathedral is well worth notice. It is an immense large old Gothic building, the spire of which was struck with lightning about 20 years ago, and entirely laid in ashes. As it was made of a forest of wood, it burned 14 hours before it was entirely consumed. To prevent these accidents for the future, the chapter had the present one built to the same height in stone, an undertaking which cost them 40,000 guilders or 4000l. It is a great pity (Baron Riefbeck observes) that it is overloaded with small ornaments: and a still greater, that this wonderful edifice is so choked up with shops and houses as to be hardly more than half visible. As, however, houses and shops are very dear in this part of the town, one cannot be very angry with the chapter for choosing rather to make the most of its ground, than to show off the church to the best advantage. The rent of a shop and a single room to live in is 150 guilders or 15l. per annum in this part of the town. There is hardly another church in Germany of the height and length of this cathedral; and the inside of it is decorated with several magnificent monuments of princes and other great personages. Besides the cathedral, the city of Mentz contains several other churches in the modern style, very well worth seeing. St Peter's, and the Jesuits church, though both too much loaded with ornament, are among this number. The church of the Augustins, of which the inhabitants of Mentz are so proud, is a masterpiece of bad taste; but that of Ignatius, though little is said about it, would be a model of the antique, if here likewise there had not been too much ornament lavished. Upon the whole, the palaces of the noblesse want that noble Mentz simplicity which alone constitutes true beauty and magnificence. In another century the externals of the city will be quite changed. The late prince built a great deal, and the present has a taste for the same sort of expense. The monks and governors of hospitals also have been forced to rebuild their houses; so that when a few more streets are made broader and straighter, the whole will have no bad appearance. The inhabitants, who together with the garrison amount to 30,000, are a good kind of people, and, like all the catholics of Germany, make great account of a good table. Their faces are interesting, and they are not deficient either in wit or activity.\n\nThere are few cities in Germany besides Vienna which contain so rich and numerous a nobility as this does: there are some houses here which have estates of 100,000 guilders, or 10,000l. a-year. The counts of Bassenheim, Schonborn, Stadion, Ingelheim, Elz, Offstein, and Walderdorf, and the lords of Dahlberg, Breitenbach, with some others, have incomes of from 30,000 to 100,000 guilders. Sixteen or eighteen houses have from 15,000 to 30,000 guilders annual revenue.\u2014The nobility of this place are said to be some of the oldest and most untainted in Germany. There are amongst them many persons of extraordinary merit, who join uncommon knowledge to all the duties of active life. Upon the whole, they are far superior to the greater part of the German nobility. Their education, however, is still too stiff. The first minister of the court was refused admittance into their assemblies for not being sufficiently noble; and they think they degrade themselves by keeping company with bourgeois.\n\nThe clergy of this place are the richest in Germany. A canonry brings in 3500 Rhenish guilders in a moderate year. The canonry of the provost brings him in 40,000 guilders a-year; and each of the deaneries is worth 2600 guilders. The income of the chapter altogether amounts to 300,000 guilders. Though it is forbidden by the canons of the church for any one to have more than a single prebend, there is not an ecclesiastic in this place who has not three or four; so that there is hardly a man amongst them who has not at least 8000 guilders a-year. The last provost, a count of Elz, had prebends enough to procure him an income of 75,000 guilders. Exclusive of the cathedral, there are several other choirs in which the canonries bring in from 1200 to 1500 guilders a-year. To give an idea of the riches of the monasteries of this place, Baron Riefbeck informs us, that at the destruction of the Jesuits, their wine, which was reckoned to sell extremely cheap, produced 120,000 rixdollars. A little while ago the elector abolished one Carthusian convent and two nunneries, in the holy cellars of which there was found wine for at least 500,000 rixdollars. \"Notwithstanding this great wealth (continues our author), there is not a more regular clergy in all Germany. There is no diocese, in which the regulations made by the council of Trent have been more strictly adhered to than they have here; the archbishops having made a particular point of it both at the time of the reformation and ever since. One thing which greatly contributes to keep up discipline is the not suffering any priest to remain in the country who\nwho has not fixed and flated duties, and a revenue annexed to them. Most of the irregularities in Bavaria, Austria, and other countries, arise from abb\u00e9s who are obliged to subsist by their daily industry and many mistakes which they can pick up. These creatures are entirely unknown here. The theological tenets of this court are also much purer than those of any other ecclesiastical prince in Germany. I was pleased to see the Bible in the hands of so many common people, especially in the country. I was told that the reading of it was not forbidden in any part of the diocese; only persons were enjoined not to read it through, without the advice of their confessors. For a long time superstition has been hunted through its utmost recesses; and though it is not quite possible to get entirely clear of pilgrimages and wonder-working images, you will meet with no priest bold enough to exorcise or to preach such nonsense as we hear in the pulpits of other German churches.\"\n\nThough the trade of this place has been constantly on the increase for these 18 or 20 years past, yet it is by no means what it ought to be from the situation and other advantages. The persons here who call themselves merchants, and who make any considerable figure, are in fact only brokers, who procure their livelihood at the expense of the country or territory round, or who act for the merchants of Frankfort. A few toy-shops, five or fix druggists, and four or five manufacturers of tobacco, are all that can possibly be called traders. There is not a banker in the whole town; and yet this country enjoys the staple privilege, and commands by means of the Maine, Neckar, and Rhine, all the exports and imports of Alsace, the Palatinate, Franconia, and a part of Swabia and Hesse, as far as the Netherlands. The port too is constantly filled with ships, but few of them contain any merchandise belonging to the inhabitants of the place. The French took it by surprise in October 1792; it surrendered to the king of Prussia in 1793; the French made a fruitless attack upon it in 1795; it was relieved from a blockade by the Austrians in 1796, and the French got possession of it in October 1797.","sp":132,"ep":139},{"h":"MENTZEL","t":"CHRISTIAN, born at Frustenwall in the Mittel-mark, is celebrated for his skill in medicine and botany, in pursuit of which he travelled through many countries.

The czar remitted the fine; and having restored him to favour, gave him the command of an army in the Ukraine in 1719, and sent him as his ambassador into Poland in 1722. Constantly employed about the means of preserving his influence after the death of his master, who was then evidently on the decline, Menzikoff discovered the person to whom the czar intended to leave the succession. The emperor was highly offended, and his penetration cost him the principality of Pleckoff. Under the czarina Catherine, however, he was higher in favour than ever; because, on the death of the czar in 1725, he was active in bringing different parties in Russia to agree to her succession. This princess was not ungrateful. In appointing her son-in-law Peter II. to be her successor, she commanded him to marry the daughter of Menzikoff, and gave the czar's fillet to his son. The parties were actually betrothed: and Menzikoff was made duke of Cozel and grand steward to the czar. But this summit of elevation was the prelude to his fall. The Dolgoroukis, favourites of the czar, had influence enough to procure his banishment, together with that of his family, to one of his own estates at the distance of 250 leagues from Moscow. He had the imprudence to leave the capital with the splendour and magnificence of a governor going to take possession of his province. His enemies took advantage of this circumstance to inflame the indignation of the czar. At some distance from Moscow he was overtaken by a detachment of soldiers. The officer who commanded them made him alight from his chariot, which he sent back to Moscow; and placed him and his whole family in covered waggons, to be conducted into Siberia, in the habit of peasants. When he arrived at the place of his destination, he was presented with cows and sheep big with young, and poultry, without knowing from whom he received the favour. His house was a simple cottage; and his employment was to cultivate the ground, or to superintend its cultivation. New causes of sorrow were added to the sufferings of exile. His wife died in the journey; he had the misfortune to lose...\nMENZINI one of his daughters by the smallpox; and his other two children were seized with the same disease, but recovered. He sunk under his misfortunes, November 2, 1729; and was buried beside his daughter, in a little chapel which he had built. His misfortunes had inspired him with sentiments of devotion, which, amid the splendor of his former situation, he had altogether neglected. His two surviving children enjoyed greater liberty after the death of their father. The officer permitted them to attend public worship on Sundays by turns. One day when his daughter was returning from the village, she heard herself accosted by a peasant from the window of a cottage, and, to her great surprize, recognized in this peasant the persecutor of her family, Dolgorouki; who, in his turn, had fallen a sacrifice to the intrigues of the court. She communicated this intelligence to her brother, who could not behold, without emotion, this new instance of the vanity and instability of honours and power. Young Menzikooff and his sister were soon after recalled to Moscow by the czarina Anna; and left Dolgorouki in possession of their cottage. He was made captain of the guards, and received the fifth part of his father's possessions. His sister was appointed maid of honour to the empress, and afterwards married to great advantage.","sp":139,"ep":140},{"h":"MENZINI","t":"BENEDICT, a celebrated Italian poet, born at Florence, was professor of eloquence at the college Della Sapienza at Rome, where he died in 1704.

Maknassia, its founder, built it first at the bottom of a valley; but Muley Idriss extended it considerably over the plain that lies to the west of the valley. It is surrounded with well cultivated fields and hills, adorned with gardens and olive plantations, and abundantly watered with rivulets. Accordingly, fruits and kitchen stuffs thrive here exceedingly, and even the superior urbanity of the inhabitants announces the temperature of the climate. The winter indeed is very inconvenient, on account of the dirtiness of the town, the streets not being paved, and the soil being slimy.\n\nMequinez is surrounded with walls; the palace itself is fortified with two battions, on which formerly some small guns were mounted. Muley Idriss, and Muley Abdallah, often in this city resisted the efforts of the Berbes, the sworn enemies of their tyranny. To the west are seen some walls of circumvallation, five feet in height, which were probably mere intrenchments for the infantry; the attacks of the Berbes being only sudden and momentary inroads, which did not require a long defence. There is at Mequinez, as well as at Morocco, a walled and guarded suburb for the Jews. The housetops are neater here than at Morocco. The Jews here are more numerous; and they can turn their industry to greater account, because the Moors in this city are more polished, and (being nearer to Europe) more civilized, than those in the Southern parts. Near the Jewry, there is another enclosed and separate quarter, called the Negro town. It was built by Muley Idriss, for the accommodation of those black families which composed his soldiery. This town is now uninhabited, as are all those destined for the same use through the rest of the empire.\n\nAt the south-east extremity of the city stands the palace of the emperor, which was built by Muley Idriss. The space occupied by this palace is very great; it includes several gardens, elegantly disposed, and well watered. There is a large garden in the centre, surrounded by a vast and pretty regular gallery, resting on columns, which communicates with the apartments. Those of the women are very spacious, and have a communication with a large chamber which looks into the garden. As you pass from one apartment to another, you find at intervals regular courts paved with square pieces of black and white marble; in the middle of these courts is a marble basin, from the centre of which rises a jet d'eau, and the water falls down into this basin. These fountains are numerous in the palace; they are useful for domestic purposes, and they serve for the ablutions, which the scruples of the Mahometans have exceedingly multiplied. The palaces of the Moorish kings are large, because they are composed only of one range of apartments; these are long and narrow, from 18 to 20 feet high; they have few ornaments, and receive the light by two large folding doors, which are opened more or less as occasion requires. The rooms are always lighted from a square court in the centre, which is generally encompassed with a colonnade.\n\nThe Moors here are more courteous than those in the southern parts; they are civil to strangers, and invite them into their gardens, which are very neat.

A merchant should therefore be acquainted with the following parts of commercial learning: 1. He should write properly and correctly. 2. Understand all the rules of arithmetic that have any relation to commerce. 3. Know how to keep books of double and single entry, as journals, a leger, &c. 4. Be expert in the forms of invoices, accounts of sales, policies of insurance, charter-parties, bills of lading, and bills of exchange. 5. Know the agreement between the money, weights, and measures of all parts. 6. If he deal in silk, woollen, linen, or hair manufactures, he ought to know the places where these different sorts of merchandises are manufactured, in what manner they are made, what are the materials of which they are composed, and from whence they come, the preparations of these materials before working up, and the places to which they are sent after their fabrication. 7. He ought to know the lengths and breadths which silk, woollen, or hair stuffs, linen, cottons, fustians, &c., ought to have according to the several statutes and regulations of the places where they are manufactured, with their different prices, according to the times and seasons; and if he can add to his knowledge the different dyes and ingredients which form the various colours, it will not be useless. 8. If he confines his trade to that of oils, wines, &c., he ought to inform himself particularly of the appearances of the succeeding crops, in order to regulate his disposing of what he has on hand; and to learn as exactly as he can what they have produced when got in, for his direction in making the necessary purchases and engagements. 9. He ought to be acquainted with the sorts of merchandise found more in one country than another, those which are scarce, their different species and qualities, and the properest method for bringing them to a good market either by land or sea. 10. To know which are the merchandises permitted or prohibited, as well on entering as going out of the kingdoms or states where they are made. 11. To be acquainted with the price of exchange, according to the course of different places, and what is the cause of its rise and fall. 12. To know the customs due on importation or exportation of merchandises, according to the usage, the tariffs, and regulations, of the places to which he trades. 13. To know the best manner of folding up, embaling, or tumbling, the merchandises for their preservation. 14. To understand the price and condition of freighting and insuring ships and merchandise. 15. To be acquainted with the goodness and value of all necessaries for the construction and repairs of shipping, the different manner of their building; what the wood, the masts, cordage, cannons, sails, and all requisites, may cost. 16. To know the wages commonly given to the captains, officers, and sailors, and the manner of engaging with them. 17. He ought to understand the foreign languages, or at least as many of them as he can attain to; these may be reduced to four, viz. the Spanish, which is used not only in Spain but on the coast of Africa, from the Canaries to the Cape of Good Hope; the Italian, which is understood on all the coasts of the Mediterranean, and in many parts of the Levant; the German, which is understood in almost all the northern countries; and the French, which is now become almost universally current. 18. He ought to be acquainted with the consular jurisdiction, with the laws, customs, and usages of the different countries he does or may trade to; and in general all the ordinances and regulations both at home and abroad that have any relation to commerce. 19. Though it is not necessary for a merchant to be very learned, it is proper that he should know something of history, particularly that of his own country; geography, hydrography, or the science of navigation; and that he be acquainted with the discoveries of the countries in which trade is established, in what manner it is settled, of the companies formed to support these establishments, and of the colonies they have sent out.\n\nAll these branches of knowledge are of great service to a merchant who carries on an extensive commerce; but if his trade and his views are more limited, his learning and knowledge may be so too; but a material requisite for forming a merchant is, his having on all occasions a strict regard to truth, and his avoiding fraud and deceit as corroding cankers that must inevitably destroy his reputation and fortune.\n\nTrade is a thing of so universal a nature, that it is impossible for the laws of Britain, or of any other nation, to determine all the affairs relating to it; therefore","sp":141,"ep":141},{"h":"MERCIA","t":"the name of one of the seven kingdoms founded in England by the Saxons. Though the latest formed, it was the largest of them all, and grew by degrees to be by far the most powerful. On the north it was bounded by the Humber and the Mersey, which separated it from the kingdom of Northumberland; on the east by the sea, and the territories of the East Angles and Saxons; on the south by the river Thames; and on the west by the rivers Severn and Dee. It comprehended well nigh 17 of our modern counties, being equal in size to the province of Languedoc in France; very little, if at all, less than the kingdom of Arragon in Spain; and superior in size to that of Bohemia in Germany.\n\nPenda is regarded as its first monarch; and the kingdom is thought to derive its name from the Saxon word *mere*, which signifies \"a march, bound, or limit,\" because the other kingdoms bordered upon it on every side; and not from the river Mersey, as some would persuade us. Penda assumed the regal title A.D. 626, and was of the age of 50 at the time of his accession; after which he reigned near 30 years. He was of a most furious and turbulent temper, breaking at different times with almost all his neighbours, calling in the Britons to his assistance, and shedding more Saxon blood than had been hitherto spilled in all their intestine quarrels. He killed two kings of Northumberland, three of the East Angles, and compelled Kenwalh king of the West Saxons to quit his dominions. He was at length slain, with most of the princes of his family, and a multitude of his subjects, in a battle fought not far from Leeds, by Oswy king of Northumberland. This battle, which the Saxon chronicle tells us was fought at Winnidfield, A.D. 655, made a great change in the Saxon affairs, which the unbridled fury of Penda had thrown into great confusion. He had the year before killed Anna king of the East Angles in battle, whose brother Ethelred notwithstanding took part with Penda. On the other hand, Penda the eldest son of Penda, to whom his father had given the ancient kingdom of the Mid Angles, had two years before married the natural daughter of King Oswy, and had been baptized at his court. At that time it should seem that Oswy and Penda were upon good terms; but after the latter had conquered the East Angles, he resolved to turn his arms against the kingdom of Northumberland. Oswy by no means had provoked this rupture; on the contrary, Bede tells us that he offered large sums of money, and jewels of great value, to purchase peace: these offers being rejected, he was reduced to the necessity of deciding the quarrel by the sword. The river near which the battle was fought overflowing, there were more drowned than killed. Amongst these, as the Saxon chronicle says, there were 35 princes of the royal line, some of whom bore the title of kings; and also Ethelred king of the East Angles, who fought on the side of Penda against his family and country.\n\nHis son Penda, who married the daughter of that conqueror, became a Christian, and was not long after murdered, as is said, by the malice of his mother. His brother Wolfher becoming king of Mercia, embraced in proof of time the faith of the gospel, and proved a very victorious and potent monarch; and is, with no fewer than seven of his immediate successors, commonly styled king of the Anglo-Saxons, though none of them are owned in that quality by the Saxon chronicle. But though possibly none of them might enjoy this honour, they were undoubtedly very illustrious princes, maintaining great wars, and obtaining many advantages over the sovereigns of other Saxon states, and especially the East Angles, whom they reduced. The extent of the Mercian territories was so ample as to admit, and so situated as to require, the constituting subordinate rulers in several provinces; to whom, especially if they were of the royal line, they gave the title of kings; which occasions some confusion in their history. Besides the establishing episcopal sees and convents, the Saxon monarchs took other methods for improving and adorning their dominions; and as Mercia was the largest, so these methods were most conspicuous therein. Coventry, as being situated in the centre, was usually, but not always, the royal residence. Penda, who was almost continually in a state of war, lived as his military operations directed, in some great town on the frontiers. Wolfher built a castle or fortified palace for his own residence, which bore his name.\u2014Offa kept his court at Sutton Walls near Hereford.\n\nIn each of the provinces there resided a chief magistrate; and if he was of the royal blood, had usually the title of king. Penda, at the time he married Oswy's daughter, had the title of king of Leicestershire.\u2014Ethelred\nMercurial. Ethelred made his brother Morwald king of Hereford; who, dying without issue, bequeathed it to his younger brother Mercelm. The like honours were sometimes conferred upon the princesses; and hence, in Mercia especially, we occasionally read of vice-queens. By these means the laws were better executed, the obedience of the subjects more effectually secured, and the splendor of their residences constantly kept up and augmented.\n\nAt length, the crown devolving sometimes on minors and sometimes on weak princes, intestine factions also prevailing, the force of this hitherto mighty kingdom began sensibly to decline. This falling out in the days of Egbert, the most prudent as well as the most potent monarch of the West Saxons, he took advantage of these circumstances; and having encouraged the East Angles to make an attempt for the recovery of their independence, he, in a conjecture every way favourable to his design, broke with the Mercians, and after a short war obliged them to submit. But this was not an absolute conquest, the kings of Mercia being allowed by him and his successors to retain their titles and dominions, till the invasion of the Danes put an end to their rule, when this kingdom had subsisted above 250 years; and when the Danes were afterwards expelled by the West Saxons, it sunk into a province, or rather was divided into many.","sp":141,"ep":143},{"h":"MERCURIALIS","t":"DOGS MERCURY; a genus of plants belonging to the dioecia class; and in the natural method ranking under the 38th order, Tricocceae.

However, there have been many claimants besides Mercury to the seven-stringed lyre. See Lyre.\n\nHis most magnificent temple was on Mount Cyrene, in Arcadia. He is described by the poets as a fair beardless youth, with flaxen hair, lively blue eyes, and a smiling countenance.

Hence Seneca takes occasion to observe, that the combats of the morning were full of humanity compared with those which followed.\n\n**Meridional distance**, in Navigation, the same with departure, or ealing and welling; being the difference of longitude between the meridian under which the ship now is, and any other meridian which she was under before.\n\n**Meridional parts**, miles, or minutes, in Navigation, are the parts by which the meridians in a Mercator's chart do increase, as the parallels of latitude decrease.\n\n**Merionethshire**, a county of North Wales, is bounded on the north by Caernarvonshire and Denbighshire; on the east by Montgomeryshire; on the west by St George's channel, or the Irish sea; and on the south by the river Dyfi, which parts it from Cardiganshire; extending 40 miles in length and 36 in breadth. It is divided into six hundreds, in which are four market towns, 37 parishes, about 5787 houses, and 29,506 inhabitants in 1801. It lies in the diocese of Bangor, and sends one member to parliament. The air is very sharp in winter, on account of its many high barren mountains; and the soil is as bad as any in Wales, it being very rocky and mountainous. However, this county feeds large flocks of sheep, many goats, and large herds of horned cattle, which find pretty good pasture in the valleys. Besides these, among their other commodities may be reckoned Welch cotton, deer, fowl, fish, and especially herrings, which are often taken on this coast in great plenty.\n\n**Merit**, signifies desert. This term is more particularly applied to signify the moral goodness of the actions of men, and the rewards to which those actions entitle them.\n\n**Merlin**, Ambrose, a famous English poet and reputed prophet, flourished at the end of the 5th century. Many surprising and ridiculous things are related of him. Several English authors have represented him as the son of an incubus, and as transporting from Ireland to England the great stones which form Stonehenge on Salisbury plain. Extravagant prophecies and other works are also attributed to him, on which some authors have even written commentaries.\n\n**Merlin**.

In the year 1187, as Lary informs us, such a monster was fished up in the county of Suffolk, and kept by the governor for six months. It bore so near a conformity with man, that nothing seemed wanting to it but speech. One day it took the opportunity of making its escape; and plunging into the sea, was never more heard of. Hist. de Angleterre, P. I. p. 403.\n\nIn the year 1430, after a huge tempest, which broke down the dikes in Holland, and made way for the sea into the meadows, &c., some girls of the town of Edam in West Friesland, going in a boat to milk their cows, perceived a mermaid embarrassed in the mud, with a very little water. They took it into their boat, and brought it with them to Edam, dressed it in woman's apparel, and taught it to spin. It fed like one of them, but could never be brought to offer at speech. Some time afterwards it was brought to Haarlem, where it lived for some years, though still showing an inclination to the water. Parival relates, that they had given it some notion of a Deity, and that it made its reverences very devoutly whenever it paused by a crucifix. Delices de Hollande.\n\nIn the year 1560, near the island of Manaar, on the western coast of the island of Ceylon, some fishermen brought up, at one draught of a net, seven mermen and mermaids; of which several Jesuits, and among the rest F. Hen. Henriques and Dimas Roquez, physicians to the viceroy of Goa, were witnesses. The physician, who examined them with a great deal of care, and made dissection thereof, affirms, that all the parts both internal and external were found perfectly conformable to those of men. See the Hist. de la compagnie de Jesus, P. II. T. iv. No 276, where the relation is given at length.\n\nWe have another account of a merman, seen near the great rock called Diamond, on the coast of Martinico. The persons who saw it, gave in a precise description of it before a notary. They affirmed that they saw it wipe its hand over its face, and even heard it blow its nose.\n\nAnother creature of the same species was caught in the Baltic in the year 1531, and sent as a present to Sigismund king of Poland, with whom it lived three days, and was seen by all the court. Another very young one was taken near Rocca de Sintra, as related by Damian Goes. The king of Portugal and the grand master of the order of St James, are said to have had a suit at law to determine which party these monsters belong to.\n\nIn Pontopidan's Natural History of Norway, also, we have accounts of mermaids; but not more remarkable or any way better attested than the above, to which we have given a place, merely to shew how far the folly and extravagance of credulity have been carried by weak minds.","sp":144,"ep":145},{"h":"MERNIS","t":"Mearns, or Kingardineshire, a county of Scotland. See Kincardineshire.\n\nMERODACH was an ancient king of Babylon, who was placed among the gods, and worshipped by the Babylonians. Jeremiah (chap. 1. 2.), speaking of the ruin of Babylon, says, \"Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces.\" We find certain kings of Babylon, in whose names that of Merodach is contained: for example, Evil-merodach and Merodach-baladan. Evil-merodach was the son of Nebuchadnezzar the Great, and had for his successor the wicked Belihazzar. Merodach-baladan, son of Baladan king of Babylon, having heard that Hezekiah had been cured miraculously (Isa. xxxix.), and that the sun had gone backwards to give him an assurance of his recovery, sent him presents, and made him compliments upon the recovery of his health.

The latter, he thinks, is very plainly the Atlaboras of the ancients; and Pliny says, that this stream encloses the left side of Mero\u00eb as the Nile does the right, in which case we must suppose him looking southward from Alexandria, otherwise the words would not apply.\n\nWe are told by Diodorus Siculus, that Mero\u00eb had its name from a sister of Cambyses' king of Persia, who died there in the expedition undertaken by that prince against the Ethiopians. His army perished with hunger and thirst in the deserts beyond Mero\u00eb, which could not have happened if they had reached Gojam, the latter being one of the most plentiful countries in the world. A further proof that Gojam cannot be the ancient Mero\u00eb, is, that the latter was enclosed between the rivers Nile and Atlaboras, while Gojam is almost entirely surrounded by the Nile. If the ancients were acquainted with Gojam, they must also have been acquainted with the fountains of the Nile, which we certainly know they were not. Pliny says that Mero\u00eb, the most considerable of all the islands of the Nile, was called Atlaboras, from the name of its left channel, which cannot be supposed any other than the junction of the Nile and Athbara. He informs us moreover, that the sun was vertical twice in the year, viz. when proceeding northward he entered the 18th degree of Taurus, and when returning he came to the 14th degree of Leo; but this could never be the case with Gojam, which lies in about 10 degrees north latitude.\n\nAgain, the poet Lucan describes Mero\u00eb by two circumstances which cannot apply to any other than the peninsula of Athbara. One is, that the inhabitants were black; which was the case with the Gymnosophists and first inhabitants, and which has been the case with all the rest down to the Saracen conquest: but the inhabitants of Gojam, as well as the other Abyssinians, are fair, at least greatly different in complexion from the blacks; they are also long-haired, and nobody imagined that they ever had philosophers or science among them, which was eminently the case with the ancient inhabitants of Mero\u00eb. The other circumstance is, that the ebony tree grew in the island of Mero\u00eb, which at this day grows plentifully in the peninsula of Athbara, and part of the province of Kuara, but not in Gojam, where the tree could not subsist on account of the violent rains which take place during six months of the year. Mr Bruce mentions another circumstance quoted from the poet Lucan, which likewise tends to prove the identity of Mero\u00eb and Athbara; viz. that though there are many trees in it, they afford no shade. This our traveller found by experience, when returning from Abyssinia through Athbara. \"The country (says he) is flat, and has very little water. The forests, though thick, afforded no sort of shade, the hunters for the sake of their sport, and the Arabs for destroying the flies, having set fire to all the dry grass and shrubs; which falling with great rapidity in the direction of the wind from east to west, though it had not time to destroy the trees, did yet wither, and occasion every leaf that was upon them to fall, unless in those spaces where villages had been, and where water was. In such spots a number of large spreading trees remained full of foliage; which, from their great height and being cleared of underwood, continued in full verdure, loaded with large, projecting, and exuberant branches. But even here the pleasure that their shade afforded was very temporary, so as to allow us no time for enjoyment. The sun, so near the zenith, changed his azimuth so rapidly, that every few minutes I was obliged to change the carpet on which I lay, round the trunk of the tree to which I had fled for shelter; and though I lay down to sleep perfectly screened by the trunk or branches, I was presently awakened by the violent rays of a scorching sun, the shade having passed beyond me. In all other places, though we had travelled constantly in a forest, we never met with a tree that could shade us for a moment, the fire having deprived them of all their leaves.\" The heat of Athbara is excessive, the thermometer having been observed at 119\u00b0: two of Mr Bruce's company died of thirst, or at least of the consequences of drinking after extreme thirst. The inhabitants live in the greatest misery, and are continually in danger from the neighbouring Arabs, who, by destroying and burning their corn, are able to reduce them to a starving condition. Notwithstanding all their disadvantages, however, they have a manufacture of coarse cotton towels, of a size just sufficient to go round the waist, which pass current as money throughout the whole country.","sp":146,"ep":146},{"h":"MEROM","t":"in Ancient Geography.

But others think, that the waters of Merom or Merome were somewhere about the brook Kishon, since there is a place of that name mentioned in the account of the battle against Sifera (Judg. v. 21.)

Anciently a part of Laconia under Menelaus, and called Messene by Homer; interpreted by the scholiast, Messenica Regia. Messenii, the people, reduced to a state of slavery and subjection by the Spartans; Messenius, the epithet.\n\nThis country is famous in history, on account of the resistance made by the Messenians against the Spartans, and the exploits of their hero Arilomenes. The first hostilities commenced about the year 652 B.C. on what occasion is uncertain. Though the Messenians were inferior in the knowledge of the art of war to the Spartans; yet, by keeping for some time on the defensive, they improved so much, that in three years time they found themselves in a capacity of giving battle to their enemies in the open Messenia field; nor did they appear to be in any degree inferior either in courage or conduct: the war was therefore protracted, with various success, on both sides. At last, both consulted the oracle at Delphi; and received for answer, \"that whoever should first dedicate 100 tripods in the temple of Jupiter at Ithome, a strong hold of the Messenians, should be masters of the country.\" The inhabitants of Messenia, on hearing this, having no money to make the tripods of brass, fell to cutting them out in wood; but before this could be accomplished, a Spartan having got into the city by stratagem, dedicated 100 little tripods of clay; which threw the Messenians into such despair, that they at last submitted to the Spartans.\n\nThe new subjects of Sparta were treated with the utmost barbarity by these cruel tyrants; so that a new war commenced under Arilomenes, a man of unconquerable valour, and enthusiastically fond of liberty. He perceived that the Argives and Arcadians, who were called the allies of the Lacedemonians, adhered to them only through fear of their power; but that in reality they hated them, and wished to revenge the injuries they had done them. To these Arilomenes applied; and receiving an answer conformable to his wishes, he engaged his countrymen unanimously to take up arms. About a year after the revolt began, and before either party had received any auxiliaries, the Spartans and Messenians met at a village called Derca, where an obstinate engagement ensued. Arilomenes was conceived to have performed more than mortal achievements: in gratitude therefore, respect being also had to his royal descent, his countrymen unanimously saluted him king; which title he modestly waved, alleging, that he took up arms to set them free, and not to make himself great; he consented, however, to accept the title of general, with a power of doing whatsoever he thought requisite for the service of the public. Knowing well the superstition of the age in which he lived, he resolved to intimidate the Spartans, by showing them what he was sure they would take for an ill omen. Disguising himself therefore, he went privately to the city, where, in the night, he hung up a shield on the wall of the temple of Minerva, with this inscription: Arilomenes dedicates this, out of the spoils of the Spartans, to the gods. It was easily perceived that this war would be both long and bloody; the Lacedemonians therefore sent deputies to Delphi, to inquire of the oracle concerning its event: the answer they received was, That it behoved the Spartans to seek a leader from Athens. The Athenians naturally envious of the Spartans, granted their request indeed, but in such a manner as manifested their spite; for they sent them for a general Tyrtaeus, a schoolmaster and poet, lame of one foot, and who was suspected to be a little out of his wits. But here their skill failed them; for this captain, notwithstanding his despicable appearance, proved of great consequence to Sparta, teaching them how to use good, and how to bear up under ill fortune.\n\nIn the mean time, Arilomenes had drawn together a mighty army, the Eleans, Argives, Sicyonians, and Arcadians, having sent troops to his assistance; the Spartans in this, as in the former war, having no ally but Corinth. The Spartan kings, according to the custom,\ncustom of their city, no sooner took the field, than, notwithstanding their inferiority in number, they offered the enemy battle, which Aristomenes readily accepted. It was long, obstinate, and bloody; but in the end the Messenians were victorious, and the Lacedemonians put to flight with a great slaughter. It is scarce to be conceived how much the Spartans were struck with this defeat: they grew weary of the war, dissatisfied with their kings, dissident of their own power, and in a word sunk into a state of general uneasiness and want of spirit. It was now that the Athenian general convinced them, that he was capable of fulfilling all the promises of the oracle; he encouraged them by his poems, directed them by his counsels, and recruited their broken armies with chosen men from among the Helotes. Aristomenes, on the other hand, acted with no less prudence and vigour. He thought it not enough to restore the reputation of the Messenians, if he did not also restore their wealth and power: he therefore taught them to act offensively against their enemies; and, entering the territories of Sparta, he took and plundered Pha\u00ebte, a considerable borough in Laconia, putting all such as made any resistance to the sword, carrying off at the same time an immense booty. This, however, was an injury which the Spartans could not brook with patience; they therefore sent immediately a body of forces to overtake the Messenians, which accordingly they did: but Aristomenes routed these pursuers, and continued to make a mighty slaughter of them, till such time as he was disabled by having a spear thrust in his side, which occasioned his being carried out of the battle. His cure, which took up some time, being finished, he resolved to carry the war even to the gates of Sparta; and to that purpose raised a very great army: but, whether he found his design impracticable, or was really diverted by some dream, he gave out, that Castor and Pollux, with their sister Helena, had appeared to him, and commanded him to desist. A short time after this retreat, going with a small party to make an incursion, and attempting to take prisoners some women who were celebrating religious rites near Egila, a village in Laconia, those zealous matrons fell upon him and his soldiers with such fury, that they put them to flight, and took him prisoner: however, he soon afterwards made his escape, and rejoined his forces. In the third year of the war, the Spartans with a great force entered Messenia, whither Arifocrates king of Arcadia was come, with a great body of troops, to the assistance of his allies: Aristomenes therefore made no difficulty of fighting when the Spartans approached; but they entering privately into a negociation with Arifocrates, engaged him with bribes and promises to betray his confederates. When the battle began, the deceitful Arcadian represented to the forces under his command the mighty danger they were in, and the great difficulty there would be of retreating into their own country, in case the battle should be lost: he then pretended, that the sacrifices were ominous; and, having terrified his Arcadians into the disposition of mind fitted to serve his purpose, he not only drew them off from both wings, but, in his flight, forced through the Messenian ranks, and put them too in confusion. Aristomenes and his troops, however, drew themselves into close order, that they might defend themselves the best they could: and Messenia indeed they had need of all their valour and skill; for the Lacedemonians, who expected this event, immediately attacked and surrounded them on all sides. Fortune was, on this occasion, too powerful either for the courage or the conduct of the Messenians; so that, notwithstanding their utmost efforts, most of their army were cut to pieces, and amongst them the chief of their nobility. Aristomenes, with the poor remains of his shattered forces, retired as well as he could; and, perceiving that it was now impossible to maintain the war against the Lacedemonians upon equal terms, he exhorted his countrymen to fortify Mount Era, and to make the best dispositions possible for a long defence. He likewise placed garrisons in Pylus and Methone on the sea coasts; and to these three places he gathered all the inhabitants, leaving the rest of Messenia to the mercy of the Spartans. They, on the other hand, looked on the war as now in a manner finished; for which reason they divided the lands among their citizens, and caused them to be carefully cultivated, while they besieged Era. But Arifomenes quickly convinced them that the war was far from being over: he chose out of all the Messenians 300 men, with whom he ravaged all the adjacent country: carried off a prodigious booty; and, when Messenia could no longer supply the wants of his garrison, penetrated into Laconia, and bore away corn, wine, cattle, and whatever else was necessary to the subsistence of his countrymen shut up in Era: so that at last the Spartans were constrained to issue a proclamation, forbidding the cultivation, not only of the Messenian territory in their hands, but also of Laconia in its vicinity; whereby they distressed themselves more than their enemies, inducing at last a famine in Sparta itself, which brought with it its usual attendant, sedition. Here again all things had gone wrong, if the wisdom of the poet Tyrt\u00e6us had not supported the Spartan courage; nor was it without much difficulty that he influenced them to continue the blockade of Era, and to maintain a flying camp for the security of the country.\n\nAristomenes, in spite of all these precautions, committed terrible depredations with his small corps of 300 men. Amongst other places which he plundered, the city of Amycl\u00e6 was one; from whence he carried not only a great quantity of riches, but also many carriages laden with provisions. The kings of Sparta lying with their troops in its neighbourhood, as soon as they heard of this expedition, marched after Aristomenes with the utmost diligence; and, as the Messenians were encumbered with their booty, came up with them before they could reach Era. In this situation of things, Aristomenes, prompted rather by despair than prudence, disposed his troops in order of battle; and, notwithstanding they were so few, made a long and vigorous resistance against the whole Lacedemonian army. At length, however, numbers prevailed: the greatest part of the Messenians were slain on the spot; and Aristomenes, with about 50 of his men who survived the slaughter, were taken prisoners; that chief having received so many wounds, that he was senseless when they carried him away. The Lacedemonians expressed the loudest joy at the sight of this illustrious captive; who for so many years, by his single abilities, had\nMes\n\nMessenia had enabled his exhausted country to defend itself against the whole force of Sparta. When he was recovered from his wounds, they decreed him and all his fellow prisoners to be thrown together into a deep cavern, which was the common punishment of the lowest kind of offenders. This judgement was executed with the utmost severity, excepting that Ariftomenes had leave to put on his armour. Three days he continued in this dismal place, lying upon and covered over with dead bodies. The third day, he was almost famished through want of food, and almost poisoned with the stench of corrupted carcases, when he heard a fox gnawing a body near him. Upon this he uncovered his face, and perceiving the fox just by him, he with one hand seized one of its hind legs, and with the other defended his face, by catching hold of its jaw when it attempted to bite him. Following as well as he could his struggling guide, the fox at last thrust his head into a little hole; and Ariftomenes then letting go his leg, he soon forced his way through, and opened a passage to the welcome rays of light, from which the noble Messenian had been so long debarred.\n\nFeeble as he was, Ariftomenes wrought himself an outlet with his nails; and travelling by night with all the expedition he could, at length arrived safe at Era, to the great joy and amazement of his countrymen. When this news was first blazed abroad, the Spartans would have had it pass for a fiction; but Ariftomenes soon put the truth of it out of doubt, by falling on the pots of the Corinthians, who, as allies of the Spartans, had a considerable body of troops before Era.\n\nMost of their officers, with a multitude of private men, he slew; pillaged their camp; and, in short, did so much mischief, that the Spartans, under the pretence of an approaching festival, agreed to a cessation of arms for 40 days, that they might have time to bury their dead. On this occasion, Ariftomenes for the second time celebrated the hetaeromphonia, or the sacrifice appointed for those who had killed 100 of the enemy with their own hands. He had performed the same before and after his second battle; and he lived to do it a third time: which must appear wonderful to the reader, when he is informed, that notwithstanding this truce, certain Cretan archers in the service of the Spartans seized Ariftomenes as he was walking without the walls, and carried him away a prisoner. There were nine of them in all; two of them immediately flew with the news to Sparta, and seven remained to guard their prize, whom they bound, and conducted to a lone cottage inhabited only by a widow and her daughter. It fell out, that the young woman dreamed the night before, that she saw a lion without claws, bound, and dragged along by wolves; and that she having loosed his bonds, and given him claws, he immediately tore the wolves to pieces. As soon as Ariftomenes came into the cottage, and her mother, who knew him, had told her who he was, she instantly concluded that her dream was fulfilled; and therefore plied the Cretans with drink, and, when they were asleep, took a poniard from one of them, cut the thongs with which Ariftomenes was bound, and then put it into his hands. He presently verified her vision, by putting all his guards to death; and then carried her and her mother to Era, where, as a reward for her service, he married the young woman to his son Gorgus, then about 18 years of age.\n\nWhen Era had held out near eleven years, it fell into the hands of Sparta by an accident: the servant of one Empiramus, a Spartan commander, driving his master's cattle to drink at the river Neda, met frequently with the wife of a Messenian, whom he engaged in an amour. This woman gave him notice, that her husband's house was without the wall; so that he could come to it without danger, when the good man was abroad; and she likewise gave him intelligence when her husband was upon duty in the garrison. The Spartan failed not to come at the time appointed; but they had not been long in bed before the husband returned, which put the house into great confusion: the woman, however, secured her gallant; and then let in her husband, whom she received in appearance with great joy, inquiring again and again by what excess of good fortune she was blest with his return. The innocent Messenian told her, that Ariftomenes being detained in his bed by a wound, the soldiers knowing that he could not walk the rounds, had a grant to retire to their houses, to avoid the inclemency of the season. The Spartan no sooner heard this, than he crept softly out of doors, and hastened away to carry the news to his master. It happened, that the kings were at this time absent from the camp, and Empiramus had the chief command of the army. As soon as he received this information, he ordered his army to begin its march, though it rained excessively, and there was no moonlight. The fellow guided them to the ford, and managed matters so well that they seized all the Messenian pots: yet, after all, they were afraid to engage; darkness, and high wind, heavy rain, together with the dread of Ariftomenes, keeping them quiet in the places they had seized. As soon as it was light, the attack began; and Era had been quickly taken, if only the men had defended it; but the women fought with such fury, and by their mingling in the fray, brought such an accession of numbers, as made the event doubtful. Three days and two nights this desperate engagement lasted: at last, all hopes of preserving the city being lost, Ariftomenes drew off his wearied troops. Early in the fourth morning, he disposed the women and children in the centre, the Messenian youth in the front and rear, the least able men in the main body: himself commanded the van; the rear-guard was brought up by Gorgus and Manticlus, the former the son of Ariftomenes, the latter of Theocles, a Messenian of great merit, who fell with much glory in this attack, fighting valiantly in the cause of his country. When all things were ready, Ariftomenes caused the last barrier to be thrown open; and, brandishing his spear, marched directly towards the Spartan troops, in order to force a passage. Empiramus, perceiving his intent, ordered his men to open to the right and left, and fairly gave them a passage; so that Ariftomenes marched off in triumph, as it were, to Arcadia.\n\nThe Arcadians, when they heard that Era was taken, were very desirous of succouring their old confederates in this deep distress: they therefore treated their king Ariftocrates to lead them into Messenia.\nBut he, corrupted by the Lacedemonians, persuaded them that it was too late; that the Messenians were all cut off; and that such a step would only expose them to the fury of the conquerors. When the thing appeared to be otherwise, and it was known that Arictomenes was on the frontiers of Arcadia, they went in crowds to carry him provisions, and to testify their readiness to assist him and those under his command all the affluence in their power. Arictomenes desired to be heard before a general assembly; which being accordingly convoked, he there opened one of the boldest and best laid schemes recorded in history: he said, that he had yet 500 undaunted soldiers, who, at his command, would undertake anything; that it was very probable most of the Spartans were employed in pillaging Eria, and that therefore he determined to march and surprise Sparta; which appeared so sensible, that all the assembly loudly commended his great capacity and unshaken courage. Arictocrates, however, took care to betray him; having, by various pretences, retarded the execution of the project. The Arcadians, who began to suspect him, waited for and surprized the messengers as they came back. They took the letters from them, and read them openly in the assembly. The purport of them was, that they acknowledged his great kindness both now and in the battle; and promised, that the Lacedemonians would be grateful. As soon as the letters were read, the Arcadians fell to stoning their king, frequently calling upon the Messenians to assist them; which, however, they did not, waiting for Arictomenes's orders; who, far from triumphing in this spectacle, stood still, with his eyes fixed on the ground, which he wet with his tears, his soul pierced with sorrow to see a crowned head so shamefully and so deservedly put to death. The Arcadians afterwards erected a monument over him, with an inscription to perpetuate his infamy. As for the Messenians under the command of Gorgus and Manticlus, they passed over into Sicily; where they founded the city of Messene, one of the most famous in the island. Arictomenes remained, however, in Greece; where he married all his daughters, except the youngest, to persons of great rank. A prince of Rhodes, inquiring of the oracle at Delphi whom he should espouse, that his subjects might be happy under his prosperity, was directed to marry the daughter of the most worthy of the Greeks; which answer was immediately understood to point at the virgin daughter of Arictomenes. Her therefore he demanded, and received; Arictomenes accompanying him back to his dominions, where he formed a scheme of uniting the Lydians and Medes against the Spartans, resolving with this view to go into Media, and to the court of Sardis; but while he meditated these great things, death surprized him, and thereby freed Lacedemon from the most formidable enemy she ever had.","sp":148,"ep":152},{"h":"MESSIAH","t":"a word signifying one anointed, or installed into an office by unction. It was usual among the Jews to anoint kings, high priests, and sometimes prophets, at the consecration or installment of them, to signify emblematically the mental qualifications necessary for discharging these offices. Saul, David, Solomon, and Joab, kings of Judah, received the royal unction. Aaron and his sons received the sacerdotal, and Elisha the disciple of Elijah received the prophetic unction.\u2014The name MESSIAH, Anointed or Christ (\u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2), was given to the kings and high-priests of the Jews. The patriarchs and prophets are also called by the name of Messiah, or the Lord's anointed. See 1 Sam. xii. 3, 5; 1 Chron. xvi. 22; Ps. cv. 15.\n\nBut this name Messiah was principally and by way of eminence given by the Jews to their expected great Deliverer, whose coming they still vainly wait; and is a name the Christians apply to Jesus Christ, in whom the prophecies relating to the Messiah were accomplished. The sum of these prophecies is, That there should be a glorious person named Messiah, descended from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who should be born at Bethlehem, of a virgin of the family of David, then in its decline, before the Jews ceased to be a people, while the second temple was standing, and about 500 years after Ezra's time; who, though appearing in mean circumstances, should be introduced by a remarkable forerunner, whose business it should be to awaken the attention and expectation of the people. That this illustrious person called Messiah should himself be eminent for the piety, wisdom, and benevolence of his character, and the miraculous works he should perform: yet that, notwithstanding all this, he should be rejected and put to death by the Jews; but should afterwards be raised from the dead, and exalted to a glorious throne, on which he should through all generations continue to rule, at the same time making intercession for sinners. That great calamities should for the present be brought on the Jews for rejecting him: whereas the kingdom of God should by his means be erected among the Gentiles, and disperse itself even unto the ends of the earth; wherever it came, destroying idolatry, and establishing true religion and righteousness. In a word, That this glorious person should be regarded by all who believed in him as a divine teacher, an atoning sacrifice, and a royal governor: by means of whom God would make a covenant with his people, very different from that made with Israel of old; in consequence of which they should be restored to, and established in, the divine favour, and fixed in a state of perpetual happiness. See Jesus Christ, and Christianity.\n\nThe Jews, as was already observed, still wait for the coming of the Messiah, being impressed with the notion of a temporal Messiah, who is to be a mighty conqueror, and to subdue all the world. Most of the modern rabbins, according to Buxtorf, believe that the Messiah is already come, but that he keeps himself concealed, and will not manifest himself because of the sins of the Jews. Some of the Jews, however, in order to reconcile these prophecies that seem to contradict each other as to the character and condition of the Messiah, have had recourse to the hypothesis of two Messiahs, who are yet to succeed each other; one in a state of humiliation and suffering; the other of glory, splendor, and power. The first, they say, is to proceed from the tribe of Ephraim, who is to fight against Gog, and to be slain by Amnillus, Zech. xii. 10. The second is to be of the tribe of Judah, and\nand lineage of David, who is to conquer and kill An-\nnillus, and restore the kingdom of Israel, reigning over\nit in the highest glory and felicity.\n\nJesus Christ affirms himself the Messiah. In St\nJohn iv. 25, the Samaritan woman says to Jesus, I\nknow that when Messiah comes, who is called the Christ,\nhe will tell us all things. Jesus answered her, I that\nspeak to thee am he.\n\nThere are several impostors, who have endeavoured\nto pass for Messiahs, as Christ himself predicted. J.\nLent, a Dutchman, has written a history De Pseudo-\nmessiahs, \"Of False Messiahs.\" The first he mentions\nwas one Barcochab, who appeared under the empire of\nAdrian. The last was Rabbi Mordecai, who began to\nbe talked of in 1682.

See Oratory, No. 54.\n\nMetaphor and Allegory, in poetry.\u2014A metaphor differs from a simile, in form only, not in substance: in a simile the two subjects are kept distinct in the expression, as well as in the thought; in a metaphor, the two subjects are kept distinct in the thought only, not in the expression. A hero resembles a lion, and upon that resemblance many similes have been raised by Homer and other poets. But instead of resembling a lion, let us take the aid of the imagination, and feign or figure the hero to be a lion; by that variation the simile is converted into a metaphor; which is carried on by describing all the qualities of a lion that resemble those of the hero. The fundamental pleasure here, that of resemblance, belongs to the thought. An additional pleasure arises from the expression: the poet, by figuring his hero to be a lion, goes on to describe the lion in appearance, but in reality the hero; and his description is peculiarly beautiful, by expressing the virtues and qualities of the hero in new terms, which, properly speaking, belong not to him, but to the lion. This will better be understood by examples. A family connected with a common parent, resembles a tree, the trunk and branches of which are connected with a common root; but let us suppose, that a family is figured, not barely to be like a tree, but to be a tree; and then the simile will be converted into a metaphor, in the following manner:\n\nEdward's sev'n sons, whereof thyself art one,\nWere sev'n fair branches, springing from one root;\nSome of these branches by the devil's cut:\nBut Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloster,\nOne flourishing branch of his most royal root,\nIs hack'd down, and his summer leaves all faded,\nBy Envy's hand and Murder's bloody axe.\n\nRichard II. act i. sc. 3.\n\nFiguring human life to be a voyage at sea.\n\nThere is a tide in the affairs of men,\nWhich, taken at the flood, leads on to Fortune:\nOmitted, all the voyage of their life\nIs bound in shallows and in miseries.\nOn such a full sea are we now afloat;\nAnd we must take the current when it serves,\nOr lose our ventures.\n\nJulius Caesar, act iv. sc. 5.\n\nFiguring glory and honour to be a garland of flowers:\n\nHastur.

A metaphor is defined above to be an act of the imagination, figuring one thing to be another. An allegory requires no such operation, nor is one thing figured to be another: it confuses in choosing a subject having properties or circumstances resembling those of the principal subject: and the former is described in such a manner as to represent the latter: the subject thus represented is kept out of view: we are left to discover it by reflection; and we are pleased with the discovery, because it is our own work. (See the word ALLEGORY.)\n\nQuintilian gives the following instance of an allegory.\n\nO navis, referent in mare te novi\nFluctus. O quid agis? fortiter occupa portum.\n\nHorat. Lib. i. ode 14.\n\nand explains it elegantly in the following words: \"Totaque ille Horatii locus, quo navim pro republica, fluctuum tempestatibus pro bellis civilibus, portum pro pace atque concordia,\" dicit.\n\nIn a figure of speech, there is no fiction of the imagination employed, as in a metaphor; nor a representative subject introduced, as in an allegory. This figure, as its name implies, regards the expression only, not the thought; and it may be defined, the using a word in a sense different from what is proper to it.\n\nThus youth, or the beginning of life, is expressed figuratively by morning of life: morning is the beginning of the day; and in that view it is employed to signify the beginning of any other series, life especially, the progress of which is reckoned by days. See Figure of Speech.\n\nMetaphor and allegory are so much connected, that it seemed proper to handle them together: the rules particularly for distinguishing the good from the bad, are common to both. We shall therefore proceed to these rules, after adding some examples to illustrate the nature of an allegory, which, with a view to this article, was but slightly illustrated under its proper name.\n\nHorace, speaking of his love to Pyrrha, which was now extinguished, expressed himself thus:\n\nMe tabula facer\nVotivae paries indicat uvida\nSuspendisse potenti\nVellimenta maris Deo.\n\nCarm. lib. i. ode 5.\n\nAgain:\nPhocbus volentem praelia me loqui,\nViolas et urbes, increpuit, lyra\nNe parva Tyrrhenum per aquor\nVela darem.\n\nCarm. lib. iv. ode 15.\n\nQueen.

Is't meet that he\nShould leave the helm, and, like a fearful lad,\n\nWith tearful eyes add water to the sea,\nAnd give more strength to that which hath too much;\nWhile in his moan the ship spits on the rock,\nWhich industry and courage might have fav'd?\nAh, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this!\n\nThird Part of Henry VI. act v. sc. 5.\n\nOroonoko. Ha! thou hast rous'd\nThe lion in his den; he stalks abroad,\nAnd the wide forest trembles at his roar.\nI find the danger now.\n\nOroonoko, act iii. sc. 2:\n\n\"My well beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill. He fenced it, gathered out the stones thereof, planted it with the choicest vine, built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a wine press therein; he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes. And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard. What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done? Wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes? And now go to, I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down. And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged, but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it. For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant.\"\n\nIsaiah v. 1.\n\nThe rules that govern metaphors and allegories are of two kinds. The construction of these figures comes under the first kind: the propriety or impropriety of introduction comes under the other.\u2014To begin with rules of the first kind; some of which coincide with those already given for similes; some are peculiar to metaphors and allegories.\n\nIn the first place, it has been observed, that a simile cannot be agreeable where the resemblance is either too strong or too faint. This holds equally in metaphor and allegory; and the reason is the same in all.\n\nIn the following instances, the resemblance is too faint to be agreeable.\n\nMalcolm. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 But there's no bottom, none,\nIn my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,\nYour matrons, and your maids, could not fill up\nThe cistern of my lust.\n\nMacbeth, act iv. sc. 4.\n\nThe best way to judge of this metaphor, is to convert it into a simile: which would be bad, because there is scarce any resemblance between lust and a cistern, or betwixt enormous lust and a large cistern.\n\nAgain:\n\nHe cannot buckle his distemper'd cause\nWithin the belt of rule.\n\nMacbeth, act v. sc. 2.\n\nThere is no resemblance between a distempered cause and any body that can be confined within a belt.\n\nAgain:\n\nSteep me in poverty to the very lips.\n\nOthello, act iv. sc. 9.\n\nPoverty\nMetaphor Poverty here must be conceived a fluid, which it resembles not in any manner.\n\nSpeaking to Bolingbroke banish'd for six years:\n\nThe sullen passage of thy weary steps,\nEsteem a foil, wherein thou art to set\nThe precious jewel of thy home-return.\n\nRichard II. act ii. sc. 6.\n\nAgain:\n\nHere is a letter, lady,\nAnd every word in it a gaping wound\nIssuing life-blood.\n\nMerchant of Venice, act iii. sc. 3.\n\nTante molis erat Romanam condere gentem.\n\n\u00c6neid. i. 37.\n\nThe following metaphor is strained beyond all endurance: Timur-bec, known to us by the name of Tamerlane the Great, writes to Bojazet emperor of the Ottomans in the following terms:\n\n\"Where is the monarch who dares resist us? where is the potentate who doth not glory in being numbered among our attendants? As for thee, descended from a Turcoman sailor, since the vessel of thy unbounded ambition hath been wreck'd in the gulf of thy self-love, it would be proper, that thou shouldest take in the fails of thy temerity, and cast the anchor of repentance in the port of sincerity and justice, which is the port of safety; lest the tempest of our vengeance make thee perish in the sea of the punishment thou deservest.\"\n\nSuch strained figures, as observed above, are not unfrequent in the first dawn of refinement; the mind in a new enjoyment knows no bounds, and is generally carried to excess, till taste and experience discover the proper limits.\n\nSecondly, Whatever resemblance subjects may have, it is wrong to put one for another, where they bear no mutual proportion. Upon comparing a very high to a very low subject, the simile takes on an air of burlesque; and the same will be the effect where the one is imagined to be the other, as in a metaphor; or made to represent the other, as in an allegory.\n\nThirdly, These figures, a metaphor especially, ought not to be crowded with many minute circumstances; for in that case it is scarcely possible to avoid obscurity. A metaphor above all ought to be short: it is difficult, for any time, to support a lively image of a thing being what we know it is not; and for that reason, a metaphor drawn out to any length, instead of illusrating or enlivening the principal subject, becomes disagreeable by overtraining the mind. Here Cowley is extremely licentious. Take the following instance.\n\nGreat and wise conqueror, who where'er\nThou com'st, dost fortify, and settle there!\nWho canst defend as well as get;\nAnd never hadst one quarter beat up yet;\nNow thou art in, thou ne'er wilt part\nWith one inch of my vanquished heart;\nFor since thou took'st it by assault from me\n'Tis garrison's so strong with thoughts of thee,\nIt fears no beauteous enemy.\n\nFor the same reason, however agreeable long allegories may at first be by their novelty, they never afford any lasting pleasure: witness the Fairy Queen, which with great power of expression, variety of images, and melody of versification, is scarce ever read a second time.\n\nIn the fourth place, The comparison carried on in a simile, being in a metaphor sunk by imagining the principal subject to be that very thing which it only resembles; an opportunity is furnished to describe it in terms taken strictly or literally with respect to its imagined nature. This suggests another rule, That in constructing a metaphor, the writer ought to make use of such words only as are applicable literally to the imagined nature of his subject: figurative words ought carefully to be avoided; for such complicated figures, instead of setting the principal subject in a strong light, involve it in a cloud, and it is well if the reader, without rejecting by the lump, endeavour patiently to gather the plain meaning, regardless of the figures:\n\nA stubborn and unconquerable flame\nCreeps in his veins, and drinks the streams of life.\n\nLady Jane Gray, act i. sc. i.\n\nCopied from Ovid:\n\nSorbent avid\u00e6 praecordia flamm\u00e6.\n\nMetamorph. lib. ix. 172.\n\nLet us analyze this expression. That a fever may be imagined a flame, we admit: though more than one step is necessary to come at the resemblance: a fever, by heating the body, resembles fire; and it is no stretch to imagine a fever to be a fire: again, by a figure of speech, flame may be put for fire, because they are commonly conjoined; and therefore a fever may be termed a flame. But now admitting a fever to be a flame, its effects ought to be explained in words that agree literally to a flame. This rule is not observed here; for a flame drinks figuratively only, not properly.\n\nKing Henry to his son Prince Henry:\n\nThou hid'st a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,\nWhich thou hast whetted on thy stony heart\nTo stab at half an hour of my frail life.\n\nSecond Part Henry IV. act iv. sc. ii.\n\nSuch faulty metaphors are pleasantly ridiculed in the Rehearsal:\n\n\"Physician. Sir, to conclude, the place you fill has more than amply exacted the talents of a wary pilot; and all these threatening storms, which, like impregnate clouds, hover o'er our heads, will, when they once are grasped but by the eye of reason, melt into fruitful showers of blessings on the people.\"\n\n\"Bayer. Pray mark that allegory. Is not that good.\"\n\n\"Johnson. Yes, that grasping of a storm with the eye is admirable.\"\n\nAct ii. sc. i.\n\nFifthly, The jumbling different metaphors in the same sentence, beginning with one metaphor and ending with another, commonly called a mix metaphor, ought never to be indulged.\n\nK. Henry.\nK. Henry. \u2014\u2014Will you again unknit\nThis churlish knot of all-abhorred war,\nAnd move in that obedient orb again,\nWhere you did give a fair and natural light?\nFirst Part Henry VI. act v. sc. 1.\n\nWhether 'tis nobler in the mind, to suffer\nThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune;\nOr to take arms against a sea of troubles,\nAnd by opposing end them.\nHamlet, act iii. sc. 2.\n\nIn the sixth place, It is unpleasent to join different metaphors in the same period, even where they are preserved distinct: for when the subject is imagined to be first one thing and then another in the same period without interval, the mind is diffracted by the rapid transition; and when the imagination is put on such hard duty, its images are too faint to produce any good effect:\n\nAt regina gravi jamdudum faucia cura,\nVulnus alti venis, et caeco carpitur igni.\n\u00c6neid. iv. 1.\n\nEst mollis flamma medullas\nInterea, et tacitum vivit sub pechore vulnus.\n\u00c6neid. iv. 66.\n\nMotum ex Metello consule civicum,\nBellique causas, et vitia, et modos,\nLudumque fortun\u00e6, graveque\nPrincipum aniciti\u00e6, et arma\nNondum expiatis uncta cruribus,\nPericulose plenum opus ale\u00e6,\nTractas, et incendis per ignes\nSubpositos cineri dolof\u00e6.\nHorat. Carm. lib. ii. ode 1.\n\nIn the last place, It is still worse to jumble together metaphorical and natural expression, so as that the period must be understood in part metaphorically, in part literally; for the imagination cannot follow with sufficient ease changes so sudden and unprepared: a metaphor begun and not carried on, hath no beauty; and instead of light, there is nothing but obscurity and confusion. Instances of such incorrect composition are without number: we shall, for a specimen, select a few from different authors. Speaking of Britain,\n\nThis precious stone set in the sea,\nWhich serves it in the office of a wall,\nOr as a most defensive to a house,\nAgainst the envy of less happier lands.\nRichard II. act ii. sc. 1.\n\nIn the first line Britain is figured to be a precious stone: in the following line, Britain, divested of her metaphorical dress, is presented to the reader in her natural appearance.\n\nThese growing feathers pluck'd from C\u00e6sar's wing,\nWill make him fly an ordinary pitch,\nWho else would soar above the view of men,\nAnd keep us all in fervile fearfulness.\nJulius C\u00e6sar, act i. sc. 1.\n\nRebus angustis animosus atque\nFortis adpare: sapienter idem\nContrahas vento nimum secundo\nTurgida vela.\nHor. Carm. lib. ii. ode 10.\n\nThe following is a miserable jumble of expressions, arising from an unsteady view of the subject, between its figurative and natural appearance:\n\nBut now from gathering clouds destruction pours,\nWhich ruins with mad rage our halcyon hours:\nMills from black jealousies the tempest form,\nWhilst late divisions reinforce the storm.\nDijonfary, canto iii.\n\nTo thee the world its present homage pays,\nThe harvest early, but mature the praise.\nPope's Imitation of Horace, book ii.\n\nOui, sa pudeur ne s'est que franche grimace,\nQu'une ombre de vertu qui garde mal la place,\nEt qui s'\u00e9vanouit, comme l'on peut favorir,\nAux rayons du soleil qu'une bourre vait voir.\nMoli\u00e8re, L'\u00c9tourdi, act iii. sc. 2.\n\nEt son feu, de pourv\u00fb de fente et de lecture,\nS'\u00e9teint \u00e0 chaque pas, faut de nourriture.\nBoileau, L'Art Po\u00e9tique, chant. iii. l. 319.\n\nDryden, in his dedication of the translation of \u00c6neid, says, \"When thus, as I may say, before the use of the loadstone, or knowledge of the compass, I was sailing in a vast ocean, without other help than the pole-star of the ancients, and the rules of the French stage among the moderns,\" &c.\n\n\"There is a time when factions, by the vehemence of their own fermentation, stun and disable one another.\"\nBolingbroke.\n\nThis fault of jumbling the figure and plain expression into one confused mass, is not less common in allegory than in metaphor.\n\nTake the following examples:\n\nHeu! quoties fidelis,\nMutatoque Deos flebit, et alpera\nNigris aquora ventis\nEmirabitur infolens,\nQui nunc te fruatur credulus aurea;\nQui semper vacuam, semper amabilem\nSperat, nec sius aur\u00e6\nFallacis.\nHorat. Carm. lib. i. ode 5.\n\nPour moi sur cette mer, qu'ici bas nous courons,\nJe songe \u00e0 me pourvoir d'\u00e9quipet et d'avirons,\n\u00c0 r\u00e9gler mes desirs, \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir l'orage,\nEt sauver, s'il se peut, ma Raison du naufrage.\nBoileau, epitre 5.\n\nLord Halifax, speaking of the ancient fabulists: \"They (says he) wrote in signs, and spoke in parables: all their fables carry a double meaning: the story is one, and entire; the characters the same throughout; not broken or changed, and always conformable to the nature of the creature they introduce. They never tell you, that the dog which snapped at a shadow, lost his troop of horse; that would be unintelligible. This is\nMetaphor. His (Dryden's new way of telling a story, and confounding the moral and the fable together.) After insisting from the Hind and Panther, he goes on thus:\n\n\"What relation has the hind to our Saviour? or what notion have we of a panther's bible? If you say he means the church, how does the church feed on lawns, or range in the forest? Let it be always a church, or always a cloven-footed beast; for we cannot bear his shifting the scene every line.\"\n\nA few words more upon allegory. Nothing gives greater pleasure than this figure, when the representative subject bears a strong analogy, in all its circumstances, to that which is represented: but the choice is seldom so lucky; the analogy being generally too faint and obscure, as to puzzle and not please. An allegory is still more difficult in painting than in poetry; the former can show no resemblance but what appears to the eye; the latter hath many other resources for showing the resemblance. And therefore, with respect to what the abbe du Bos terms mixt allegorical compositions, these may do in poetry; because, in writing, the allegory can easily be distinguished from the historical part: no person, for example, mistakes Virgil's Fame for a real being. But such a mixture in a picture is intolerable; because in a picture the objects must appear all of the same kind, wholly real or wholly emblematical. For this reason, the history of Mary de Medicis, in the palace of Luxembourg, painted by Rubens, is unpleasing by a perpetual jumble of real and allegorical personages, which produce a discordance of parts, and an obscurity upon the whole: witness, in particular, the tablature representing the arrival of Mary de Medicis at Marseilles; where, together with the real personages, the Nereids and Tritons appear founding their shells: such a mixture of fiction and reality in the same group is strangely absurd. The picture of Alexander and Roxana, described by Lucian, is gay and fanciful; but it suffers by the allegorical figures. It is not in the wit of man to invent an allegorical representation deviating farther from any shadow of resemblance, than one exhibited by Louis XIV. anno 1664; in which an enormous chariot, intended to represent that of the sun, is dragged along, surrounded with men and women, representing the four ages of the world, the celestial signs, the seasons, the hours, &c. a monstrous composition, and yet scarcely more absurd than Guido's tablature of Aurora.\n\nIn an allegory, as well as in a metaphor, terms ought to be chosen that properly and literally, are applicable to the representative subject; nor ought any circumstance to be added that is not proper to the representative subject, however justly it may be applicable properly or figuratively to the principal. The following allegory is therefore faulty:\n\nFerus et Cupido,\nSemper ardentes acuens sagittas.\nCote cruenta.\nHorat. lib. ii, ode 8.\n\nFor though blood may suggest the cruelty of love, it is an improper or immaterial circumstance in the representative subject: water, not blood, is proper for a whetstone.\n\nWe proceed to the next head, which is, to examine in what circumstances these figures are proper, in what improper. This inquiry is not altogether superseded by what is said upon the same subject in the article Comparison; because, upon trial, it will be found, that a short metaphor or allegory may be proper, where a simile, drawn out to a greater length, and in its nature more solemn, would scarcely be relished.\n\nAnd, in the first place, A metaphor, like a simile, is excluded from common conversation, and from the description of ordinary incidents. Secondly, In expressing any severe passion that totally occupies the mind, metaphor is unnatural.\n\nThe following example, of deep despair, beside the highly figurative style, has more the air of raving than of sense:\n\nCalifa. Is it the voice of thunder, or my father?\nMadness! confusion! let the storm come on,\nLet the tumultuous roar drive all upon me,\nDahr my devoted bark; ye surges, break it;\n'Tis for my ruin that the tempest rises.\nWhen I am lost, sunk to the bottom low,\nPeace shall return, and all be calm again.\n\nFair Penitent, act v.\n\nThe following metaphor is sweet and lively; but it suits not the fiery temper of Chamont, inflamed with passion: parables are not the language of wrath venting itself without restraint:\n\nChamont. You took her up a little tender flow'r,\nJust sprouted on a bank, which the next frost\nHad nipp'd; and with a careful loving hand,\nTransplanted her into your own fair garden,\nWhere the sun always shines: there long she flourish'd,\nGrew sweet to sense, and lovely to the eye;\nTill at the last a cruel spoiler came,\nCropt this fair rose, and riled all its sweetness,\nThen cast it like a loathsome weed away.\n\nOrphan, act iv.\n\nThe following speech, full of imagery, is not natural in grief and dejection of mind.\n\nGonfalone. O my son! from the blind dotage\nOf a father's fondness these ills arose,\nFor thee I've been ambitious, base, and bloody:\nFor thee I've plung'd into this sea of sin;\nStemming the tide with only one weak hand,\nWhile o'ther bore the crown (to wreath thy brow),\nWhose weight has sunk me ere I reach'd the shore.\n\nMourning Bride, act v. sc. 6.\n\nThere is an enchanting picture of deep distress in Macbeth, where Macduff is represented lamenting his wife and children, inhumanly murdered by the tyrant. Stung to the heart with the news, he questions the messenger over and over: not that he doubted the fact, but that his heart revolted against so cruel a misfortune. After struggling some time with his grief, he turns from his wife and children to their savage butcher: and then gives vent to his resentment, but still with manliness and dignity:\n\nO, I could play the woman with mine eyes,\nAnd braggart with my tongue. But, gentle Heav'n!\nCut short all intermission; front to front\nBring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;\nWithin,\nMetaphorical expression, indeed, may sometimes be used with grace where a regular simile would be intolerable; but there are situations so severe and dispiriting, as not to admit even the slightest metaphor. It requires great delicacy of taste to determine with firmness, whether the present case be of that nature: perhaps it is; yet who could with a single word of this admirable scene altered?\n\nBut metaphorical language is proper when a man struggles to bear with dignity or decency a misfortune however great; the struggle agitates and animates the mind:\n\n**METAPHYSICS.**\n\nDefinition. **Metaphysics** has been defined, by a writer deeply read in the ancient philosophy, \"The science of the principles and causes of all things existing.\" This definition, we think, extremely proper; and hence it is, that mind or intelligence, and especially the supreme intelligence, which is the cause of the universe, and of every thing which it contains, is the principal subject of this science; and hence, too, the science itself received its name. Aristotle, indeed, who, of all the ancient metaphysicians whose works have come down to us, was unquestionably the greatest, calls this science **the first philosophy**, as being not only superior, but also prior in the order of nature, to the whole circle of the other arts and sciences. But, \"what is first to nature, is not first to man.\" Nature begins with causes, which produce effects. Man begins with effects, and by them ascends to causes. Thus all human study and investigation proceed of necessity in the reverse of the natural order of things, from sensible to intelligible, from body the effect, to mind, which is both the first and the final cause. Now, **physics** being the name given by the Stagyrite to the philosophy of body, some of his interpreters, from this necessary course of human studies, called that of mind **metaphysics**, implying by that term, not only that its subject is more sublime and difficult, but also that the study of it would be most properly and successfully entered upon after that of physics. To this name, which, though it has sometimes been treated with ridicule, is abundantly significant, the followers of Aristotle were led by their master, who, to the books in which he pretends to elevate the mind above things corporeal to the contemplation of God and things spiritual, prefixed the Greek words \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1 (A).\n\nThe science of Metaphysics has been divided, according to the objects which it considers, into six principal parts, which are called, 1. Ontology; 2. Cosmology; 3. Anthroposophy; 4. Psychology; 5. Pneumatics; and, 6. Metaphysical theology.\n\n1. That part of the science which is named ontology; logy, investigates and explains the nature and essence of all beings, as well as the qualities and attributes that essentially appertain to them. Hence it has been said that ontology should proceed in its operations from the most simple ideas; such as do not admit of any other qualities of which they may be compounded. These simple ideas are of being, of essence, of substance, of mode, of existence as well with regard to time as place, of a necessary cause of unity; the idea of negation; the difference between a being that is simple or compound, necessary or accidental, finite or infinite; the ideas of essential and abstract properties, such as of the greatness, perfection, and goodness of beings, &c. The business therefore of ontology, is to make us acquainted with every kind of being in its nature and essential qualities, which distinguish it from all other beings. This knowledge being once established on simple principles, just consequences may thence be drawn, and those things proved after which the metaphysician inquires, and which is the business of his science to prove.\n\nIt is easy to conceive, that even a clear knowledge of beings, and their essential properties, would be still defective and useless to man, if he did not know how to determine and fix his ideas by proper denominations, and consequently to communicate his perceptions to those whom he would instruct, or against whom he is obliged to dilate. To render our ideas therefore intelligible to others, we must have determinate words or denominations for each being, and the qualities of each being; and ontology teaches us those terms which are so necessary to fix our ideas, and to give them the requisite perspicuity and precision, that when we endeavour to extend the sphere\n\n---\n\n(A) \u03a4\u039f\u039d \u039c\u0395\u03a4\u0391 \u03a4\u0391 \u03a6\u03a5\u03a3\u0399\u039a\u0391.

Synopsis Doctr. Peripat.\nDivisions of our knowledge, we may not waste our time in disputes about words.\n\n2. Metaphysics, having, in as solid a manner as Cosmology; possible, explained and established the principles above mentioned, continues its inquiries to the second part, which is called cosmology, and examines into the essence of the world and all that it contains; its eternal laws; of the nature of matter; of motion; of the nature of tangible bodies, their attributes and adjuncts; and of all that can be known by reasoning and experience. It is also in cosmology that the metaphysicians of this school examine the Leibnitzian system; that is, whether God, in creating the world, must necessarily have created the best world; and if this world be so in fact. In this manner they pursue the argument, from consequence to consequence, to its last resort, frequently with very little advantage to truth and science.\n\n3. Anthroposophy, or the knowledge of man, forms the third branch of metaphysics. It is subdivided into two parts. The first, which consists in the knowledge of the exterior parts of the human frame, belongs not to this science, but to Anatomy and Physiology. The business of the metaphysician is here to ascertain the nature of those powers by which all the motions essential to life are produced; and to discover, if possible, whether they be corporeal or spiritual. This inquiry leads at the same time to Psychology;\n\n4. Psychology; which consists in the knowledge of the intellectual soul in particular; concerning which the most profound, the most subtle, and most abstract researches, have been made that human reason is capable of; and concerning the substance of which, in spite of all these efforts, it is yet extremely difficult to support any positive opinion with conclusive or probable arguments.\n\n5. The fifth part of metaphysics is called pneumatology. By this term, which has not been long in use, metaphysicians mean the knowledge of all spirits, angels, &c. It is easy to conceive what infinite art is necessary to give an account of that, of which nothing positive can ever be known in the present state of human existence. But the metaphysician of this school readily offers to show us, \"what is the idea of a spirit; the effective existence of a spirit; what are its general qualities and properties; that there are rational spirits, and that these rational spirits have qualities that are founded in the moral attributes of God:\" for this is in so many words what is attempted to be taught in pneumatology.\n\n6. Metaphysical theology, which Leibnitz and some others call theodicy, is the sixth and last branch of the science of metaphysics. It teaches us the knowledge of the existence of God; to make the most rational suppositions concerning his divine essence, and to form a just idea of his attributes and perfections, and to demonstrate them by abstract reasoning. Theodicy differs from natural theology, in as much as this last borrows, in fact, from theodicy proofs and demonstrations to confirm the existence of a supreme Being: but after having solidly established that great truth, by extending its consequences natural theology teaches us what are the relations and connexions that subsist between the supreme Being and men, and what are the duties which result from these relations.\n\nWe have briefly mentioned these divisions of the science, because they were once prevalent in the schools. The greater part of them, however, appears to us to be not only superfluous, but such as can serve no other purpose than to perplex the mind. The only free useless beings of which we know anything are mind and body; and we have no reason to think that there are any other beings in the universe. Of bodies indeed there are various kinds, endowed with different properties: and it is extremely probable, that of minds endowed with different powers, the variety may be equally great. Our own minds we know to be united in one system with bodies by which they perform all their operations; and we can demonstrate that there is another Mind, which is independent of all body, and is the cause of all things. Between these there may be numberless orders of minds; but their energies are wholly unknown to us, and therefore they can never become the objects of science.\n\nMind and body therefore, i.e., the minds and bodies which we know to exist, together with their powers and properties, essential and accidental, can alone be the subjects of rational inquiry. We may inquire into the essence of mind and the essence of body, and endeavour to ascertain in what respects they differ. We may examine the nature of different bodies, in order to discover whether all bodies, however modified, have not something in common; and we may consider the properties, relations, and adjuncts of bodies, and endeavour to distinguish those which are accidental from such as appear to be necessary that without them body itself could not exist. Of minds we cannot make the same comparison. In this part of the science we have not sufficient data for an accurate and complete induction; we can only examine the powers of our own mind; and by probable analogy make some estimate of the powers of superior minds, as observation will help us to guess at the powers of those which are placed beneath us in the scale of existence.\n\nIf this be so, Cosmology, as distinguished from Ontology, cannot properly be a branch of Metaphysics. For if mind and body, with their several powers, properties, and adjuncts, compose the universe, it is obvious, that when we have ascertained, as well as we are able, the essence of mind and the essence of body, together with the powers and properties of each, and have traced them all to the first cause, we have done every thing in the science of the universe, if we may use the expression, which belongs to the province of the metaphysician. The particular laws of motion on the earth and in the planetary system belong to the natural philosopher and astronomer.\n\nIn like manner, Anthroposophy, Psychology, Pneumatology, if they be not words expressive of distinctions where there is no difference, seem to be at least very needlessly distinguished from each other. Of the nature of spirits we can know nothing but from contemplating the powers of our own minds; and the body of man is in the province, not of the metaphysician, but of the anatomist and physiologist. Anthroposophy, psychology, and pneumatology, if they be used to denote our knowledge of all minds except the Supreme, are words of the same import; for of no created minds except our own can we acquire such knowledge as deserves the name of science.\nOntology has sometimes been defined the science of the science being in the abstract; but in the course of our inquiries it will be seen, that being in the abstract is a phrase without meaning. Considered as the science of real beings and their properties, Ontology is a very significant word, of the same import with Metaphysics, comprehending in itself the knowledge of the nature of all things existing. Or if it be thought proper to make a distinction between ontology and theology, the former branch of the science will teach the knowledge of body and created minds, whilst it is the province of the latter to demonstrate the existence and attributes of that mind which is uncreated.\n\nBody and mind, therefore, with their properties, adjuncts, and powers, comprehend the whole subject of the science of metaphysics: and as we are earlier acquainted with body than with mind, the natural order of conducting our inquiries seems to be, to begin with the former, and thence proceed to the latter. It is obvious, however, that if we would pursue these inquiries with any hopes of success, we must first trace human knowledge from its source, ascertain the nature of truth, and show what kind of evidence on each topic to be treated ought to enforce conviction. In this view of the science, metaphysics appears to be divided into three parts; the first treating of human understanding; the second, of body with its adjuncts; and the third, of mind with its powers.\n\nPrevious to the entering upon such inquiries, some philosophers of great merit have thought it expedient to explain the terms which they might have occasion to use. Their conduct is judicious and worthy of imitation; for the objects of metaphysics being, for the most part, such as fall not under the cognizance of the senses, are liable to be differently apprehended by different men, if the meanings of the words by which they are expressed be not ascertained with the utmost precision. We intend, however, to use very few words but in the common acceptation; and we therefore hope, that as terms of science are explained under different words in Divisions of the Dictionary, to which references are made, we have the Science little or no occasion for dwelling the article by previous definitions. There are indeed two words which have given rise to much useless dilutation, which yet cannot be banished from speculative philosophy, and which it will therefore be proper here to define. The words to which we allude are idea and notion. These are very generally considered as synonymous; but we think that much logomachy might have been avoided by affixing to each a determinate signification. We know not any philosopher who made much use of the word idea before Plato; but with his mysterious doctrine concerning ideas we have here nothing to do: our present business is to ascertain the precise meaning of the word, which is evidently derived from ido to see, as the word notion is from \"nofo, novi, notum,\" and that from \u03b3\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 to know or understand. In the original sense of the two words, therefore, notion is more comprehensive than idea, because we know many things which cannot be seen. We have not a doubt, but that at first the word idea was employed to denote only those forms of external objects which men contemplate in their imaginations, and which are originally received through the senses of sight. Its signification was afterwards extended to the relics of every sensation, of touch, taste, sound, and smell, as well as of sight; and at last it was confounded with notion, which denotes the mental apprehension of whatever may be known. In our use of the word idea, except when we quote from others, we shall employ it only to denote that appearance which absent objects of sense make in the memory or imagination (b); and by the word notion we shall denote our apprehension or knowledge of spirits, and all such things as, though they be the objects of science, cannot be perceived by the external senses. Having said this, we proceed to our inquiries, beginning with that into human understanding.\n\nPART I. OF HUMAN UNDERSTANDING.\n\nPreliminary Observations on the Origin of our Ideas and Notions.\n\nTHAT the mind of man has no innate ideas or notions, but comes into the world ignorant of everything, is a truth which since the days of Locke has been very little disputed. In the first book of his Essay on the Human Understanding, that acute philosopher has demonstrated, that the rudiments or first principles of all our knowledge are communicated to us by sensation; and he has compared the mind, previous to the operation of external objects upon the senses, to a tabula rasa or sheet of white paper. To repeat his arguments would swell the article to no purpose. There is not a man capable of attending to his own ideas, who\n\n(b) In thus restricting the meaning of the word idea, we have the honour to agree with the great English Lexicographer.\u2014\"He was particularly indignant against the almost universal use of the word idea in the sense of notion or opinion, when it is clear that idea can only signify something of which an image may be formed in the mind. We may have an idea or image of a mountain, a tree, or a building; but we cannot surely have an idea or image of an argument or proposition. Yet we hear the sages of the law delivering their ideas upon the question under consideration; and the first speakers in Parliament entirely coinciding in the idea, which has been so ably stated by an honourable member; or representing an idea as unconstitutional, and fraught with the most dangerous consequences to a great and free country. This Johnson called modern cant.\" Boswell's Life of Johnson.\nwho can entertain a doubt in what manner he received them. Without the sense of sight, we could never have known colours; nor sound, without hearing; nor hardness, softness, smoothness, pain, or bodily pleasure, without touch; nor odours, without smell, &c.\n\nIf evident as these facts are, objections have been started to the inferences drawn from them; and Locke has been accused of advancing principles subversive of all distinction between truth and falsehood, and favourable of course to universal skepticism.\u2014\"The first book of his Essay, which with submission (says Dr. Beattie*) I think the worst, tends to establish this dangerous doctrine, that the human mind, previous to education and habit, is as susceptible of one impression as of another: a doctrine which, if true, would go near to prove that truth and virtue are no better than human contrivances; or at least that they have nothing permanent in their nature, but may be as changeable as the inclinations and capacities of men; and that there is no such thing as common sense in the world. Surely this is not the doctrine which Mr. Locke meant to establish.\" We are so thoroughly satisfied, that it is not, that we cannot help wondering how such inferences could, by a man of learning, genius, and candour, be drawn from anything which is to be found in the Essay on the Human Understanding.\n\nBut the Doctor thinks Mr. Locke's \"finile of the mind to white paper one of the most unlucky allusions that could have been chosen; because the human soul, when it begins to think, is not extended, nor of a white colour, nor incapable of energy, nor wholly unfurnished with ideas, nor as susceptible of one impression or character as of any other;\" and it has been observed by another objector\u2020, that \"on a sheet of white paper you may write that sugar is bitter; wormwood sweet; fire and frost in every degree pleasing and sufferable: that compassion and gratitude are base; treachery, falsehood, and envy, noble; and that contempt is indifferent to us.\"\n\nAll this is true; but we apprehend it is not to the purpose. Mr. Locke has no where expressed himself in such a manner as to lead us to suppose that he believed the soul to be extended or coloured; or, when it begins to think, incapable of energy, and wholly unfurnished with ideas: but he certainly did believe, that it begins not to think the first instant of its existence, and that it acquires all the ideas of which it is ever possessed. We may undoubtedly write upon a piece of white paper that sugar is bitter, and that wormwood is sweet; but how the capacity of paper to receive the symbols of false propositions should make Mr. Locke's comparison improper or dangerous, we cannot comprehend. Mr. Uther indeed says, that it is improper on this account, \"that no human art or industry is able to make those impressions upon the mind: in respect of them, the mind discovers not a passive capacity, but refutes them with the force of fate.\" Does it indeed? does the mind reject the idea of sugar or of bitterness, of contempt or of indifference? May not any man have the idea of sugar and at the same time the idea of bitterness, and compare the one with the other in his mind, as well as the word sugar may be written beside the word bitter, and connected with it on the same piece of paper? In all this we perceive nothing that is impossible or even difficult.\n\nThe mind cannot indeed be made to feel that sugar has the same taste with wormwood; but who ever thought that it could? Not Mr. Locke, we shall be bold to say; nor does his finile give the smallest countenance to such an absurdity. The author of the Essay on the Human Understanding underlined his subject too well to imagine that either truth or falsehood could be communicated to paper, or that paper is capable of comparing ideas. Paper is capable of receiving nothing but lines or figures; and if passively receives whatever lines or figures we may choose to inscribe on it: yet if a pen be carried over it in a circular direction, the figure impressed will not be a square; just as, to the mind of one eating sugar, the taste communicated is not that of wormwood.\n\nOn a piece of paper a circle may be described, and close beside it a square: in like manner an agreeable sensation may be communicated to the mind, and immediately afterwards a sensation that is disagreeable. These two sensations, or the ideas which they leave behind them, may be compared together; and it is certainly true that no art or industry can make them appear similar in the mind: but is it not equally true, that no art or industry can make the circle and the square similar on the paper? The paper is susceptible of any sort of plain figures, and the mind is equally susceptible of any sort of ideas or sensations; but figures dissimilar cannot be made to coincide, neither can discordant ideas be made to agree. Again, one may write upon paper, that \"a circle is a square,\" and likewise that \"a circle is not a square;\" and both these propositions may be communicated to the mind by the organs of sight or of hearing. The paper receives the words expressive of the false as well as those expressive of the true proposition; and the mind receives the ideas and relations signified by the one cluster of words as well as those signified by the other: but in the mind the idea of a square is different from that of a circle, and on the paper the figure of a square is different from the figure of a circle. The great difference between the mind and the paper is, that the former is conscious of its ideas, and perceives their agreement or disagreement; whereas the paper is not conscious of the figures drawn upon it, nor perceives any thing about them. But still those figures are what they are; they either agree or disagree on the paper, as well as the ideas either agree or disagree in the mind. It is not in the power of the mind to alter the ideas of the square and the circle, not in the power of the paper to alter the forms of those figures.\n\nIt appears then, that the principles of Mr. Locke, and the comparison by which he illustrates them, have no more tendency to subvert the difference between truth and falsehood, right and wrong, than the passiveness of paper has to subvert the difference between a straight line and a crooked, a circle and a square; and with a view to establish the doctrine of innate ideas and instinctive principles of knowledge, we might with as much propriety ask, Whether it be possible to imagine that any mode of manufacture could make paper of such a nature, as that a pen drawn over it in a circular direction would leave the figure of a square? as that, \"Whether it be possible to imagine, that any course of education could ever bring a rational creature to believe that two and two are equal to three.\"\nThe mind being thus, as we may say, originally white paper, void of all characters, without ideas or notions of any kind, the first question which we have to consider is, Whence and in what manner it derives the materials of all its knowledge? To this question the only answer which can be given is, That it derives them from observation and experience; from observation, either employed upon external objects of sense, or turned inwardly upon its own operations. Our senses, conversant about particular external objects, convey into the mind several distinct perceptions; such as those of colour, figure, heat, cold, bitterness, sweetness, and all those things which are usually called sensible qualities. The notions, ideas, or whatever else they may be called, which are acquired in this manner, may be called sensible knowledge; and the source of that knowledge is termed sensation.\n\nThe other fountain from which experience furnishes the understanding with knowledge, is that attention which we are capable of giving to the operations of our own minds when employed about those ideas which were originally suggested by objects of sense. These operations, when the soul comes to reflect on them, furnish us with a set of notions entirely different from the ideas of sense; such as the notions of perception, thinking, doubting, believing, reasoning, knowing, willing, and all the different energies and passions of our own minds. Of these operations we are always conscious when we are awake; but it requires, as shall be shown afterwards, no inconsiderable effort to set them, as it were, at a distance, to reflect on them and consider what they are; but when we have made this effort, we acquire notions as distinct, and perhaps more important, than those ideas which we receive through the medium of the senses.\n\nSensation and reflection then furnish mankind with the first materials of all their knowledge. The mind seems not to have ideas or notions of any kind which it did not receive by one or other of these ways. By means of the senses it perceives external objects; and by that power which it has of turning its attention upon itself, it discovers the nature and manner of its own operations.\n\nAlthough the knowledge which we acquire from reflection be of equal importance, and perhaps of greater certainty than that which we receive through the medium of the senses, it comes into the mind at a much later period; both because it is impossible that the faculties of the mind should operate without materials, and because it is much more difficult to attend to these operations even while they are going on, than to the objects of sense which solicit our attention. It is for this reason pretty late before children have any notions whatever of the operations of their own minds; and of the greater part of these operations the bulk of mankind have no clear or accurate notions during their whole lives. On the other hand, every human being is so surrounded with bodies, which perpetually and variously affect his senses, that a variety of sensible ideas force an entrance even into the minds of children. In order therefore to trace the procedure of the understanding, and to ascertain the extent and limits of human knowledge, it should seem that we must begin with considering the external senses, that we may discover the manner in which we receive knowledge by means of them, the objects of that knowledge, and its certainty. It is to be observed, however, that though we consider the mind as possessed of many powers or faculties, and inquire first into the nature of that faculty which we conceive to be first exerted, this is done merely for the sake of proceeding in our subject with method and perspicuity. The mind is one simple and undivided being; and in every mental energy it is the whole mind, and not any part or portion of it, that is energetic. On this account, it is impossible to explain even the nature of sensation and perception to him who knows not what is meant by will and understanding; but to every one who is acquainted with the common import of these words, and who has read the short system of Logic inserted in this Work, we hope that our theory of perception will be intelligible and convincing.\n\nChap. I. Of Sensation and Perception.\n\nSect. I. Of Sensation.\n\nThe Supreme Being, who made us and placed us in this world, has given us such powers of mind as by five organs he saw to be suited to our state and rank in his creation. He has given us the power of perceiving many objects around us; but that power is limited in various ways; and particularly in this, that without the organs of the several senses we perceive no external object. The senses, as every one knows, are five in number, and each communicates its proper sensation. It is by the eyes alone that we see, by the ears that we hear, by the nose that we smell, and by the tongue and palate that we taste; the sense of feeling or touch is spread over the whole body, for we feel equally by our hands and by our feet, &c. To the powers of perception by the senses it is necessary not only that we have all the organs enumerated, but that we have them also in a sound and natural state. There are many disorders of the eye which cause total blindness, as well as others which impair without destroying the power of vision. The same thing is true of the organs of all the other senses.\n\nAll this is so well known from experience, that it needs no proof; but it may be worth while to observe, that it is known from experience only*. For any thing that we know to the contrary, our Creator might have endowed us with the power of perception by a thousand intellectual organs of sense, all different from those which we possess; and it is certain that he himself perceives every thing more perfectly than we do without bodily organs. For it is to be observed, that the organs of sense are different from the being which is sentient.\u2014It is not the eye which sees, nor the ear which hears; these are sentient, only the organs by which we see and hear. A man cannot see the satellites of Jupiter but by means of a telescope, nor hear a low voice but by means of an ear trumpet. Does he from this conclude that it is the telescope which sees those satellites, or the trumpet which hears that voice? Such a conclusion would be evidently absurd. It is no less absurd to conclude that it is the eye which sees, or the ear which hears. The telescope and the trumpet are artificial organs of sight and of hearing, of which the eye and the ear are natural organs; but the natural organs see and hear as little as the artificial.\n\nThat this is the case with respect to the eye and the ear,\near, is so obvious, that, as far as we know, it has never been denied. But with respect to the senses of touch, taste, and smell, the truth at first view appears not so evident. A celebrated writer has observed*, that \"after the utmost efforts, we find it beyond our power to conceive the flavour of a rose to exist in the mind: we are necessarily led to conceive that pleasure as existing in the nostrils, along with the impression made by the rose upon that organ (c); and the same will be the result of experiments with respect to every feeling of taste, touch, and smell. Touch (he says), affords the most satisfactory evidence, and philosophy detects the delusion.\" To detect this delusion requires, indeed, no great depth in philosophy; for it is so far from being true that we are necessarily led otherwise than by association, of which the laws shall be explained afterwards, to conceive the pleasure or pain of touch as existing at that part of our body upon which the impression is made, that, as every man must have observed, children previous to experience cannot distinguish the precise place of their bodies which is affected by the touch of any external object. Nay, we believe it will be found upon trial, that if a full grown man, with all the experience of age to guide him, be pricked with a pin on any part of his body which he has seldom handled, and never seen, he will not readily nor at first put his finger upon the wound, nor even come very near to the wound. This, however, he would certainly and infallibly do were the sense of touch necessarily conceived as existing at the organ. To these observations objections may perhaps be made, which we cannot stay to obviate; but the following, we think, will admit of none. We appeal to every man who has experienced that particular sensation of touch which Scaliger dignified with the name of a fifth sense, whether, whilst those sensations were new to him, he was necessarily led to conceive them as existing at any particular organ. If he was not, it follows undeniably that the organs of sensation are different from the being which is sentient; that it is not the eye which sees, the ear which hears, the nostrils which smell, the tongue which tastes, nor any part of the body which feels; and that it is by experience that we learn to associate our several sensations with those organs upon which the impressions are made.\n\nIt is, however, certain that we receive no sensation from external objects, unless when some impression is made upon the organ of sense, either by the immediate application of the object itself, or by some medium which passes between the object and the organ\u2020. In two of our senses, viz. touch and taste, there must be an immediate application of the object to the organ. In the other three the sensation is occasioned by the impression of some medium passing from the object to the organ. The effluvia of bodies drawn into the nostrils with the breath are the medium of smell; the undulations of the air are the medium of hearing; and the rays of light passing from visible objects to the eye are the medium of sight. These are facts known from experience to hold universally both in men and in brutes. It is likewise a law of our nature perfectly known to all who know anything of anatomy, that in order to actual sensation the impressions made upon the external organs must be communicated to the nerves, and from them to the brain. First, the object, either immediately, or by some medium, makes an impression upon the organ; the organ serves only as a medium, by which the impression is communicated to the nerves; and the nerves serve as a medium to carry it on to the brain. Here the corporeal part ends; at least we can trace it no farther. The rest is all intellectual.\n\nThe proof of these impressions upon the nerves and brain in sensation is this, that from many observations and experiments it is found, that when the organ of any sense is perfectly found, and has the impression made upon it by the object ever so strongly, yet if the nerve which serves that organ be cut or tied hard, there is no sensation; and it is well known that disorders in the brain deprive us of sensation, while both the organ and its nerve are sound.\n\nThere is sufficient reason, therefore, to conclude, that in sensation the object produces some change in nature in the organ; that from the organ the change proceeds to the nerve, and from the nerve to the brain. Hence it is that we have positive sensations, from negative objects, or mere nonentities, such as darkness, blackness, and vacancy. For, sensation resulting from changes in the brain, whatever produces any change must of course occasion a new sensation: but it is obvious, that the mere absence of any impression, by the removal of the object which produced it, must as necessarily cause a change in the organ, nerves, and brain, as the presence of a new impression from a new object. To these changes, or that which immediately produces them, we give the name of impressions; because we know not how, in a general manner, to express more properly any change produced by an external cause without specifying the nature of that cause. Whether it be pressure, or attraction, or repulsion, or vibration, or something unknown, for which we have no name, still it may be called an impression.\n\nSir Isaac Newton was perhaps the first who supposed that the rays of light falling upon the bottom of the eye excite vibrations in the tunica retina; and that those vibrations being propagated along the solid fibres of the optic nerves into the brain, cause the actual sensation of seeing. This hypothesis was adopted by Dr Hartley, applied to the other senses, and shown to be\n\n(c) Another eminent writer thinks on this subject very differently, and in our opinion much more justly.\u2014\"Suppose (says Dr Reid) a person who never had this sense (viz. smell) before, to receive it all at once, and to smell a rose; can he perceive any similarity or agreement between the smell and the rose? or indeed between it and any other object whatever? Certainly he cannot. He finds himself affected in a new way, he knows not why, or from what cause. He is conscious that he is not the cause of it himself; but he cannot from the nature of the thing determine whether it be caused by body or spirit; by something near, or by something at a distance. He cannot give it a place any more than he can give a place to melancholy or joy; nor can he conceive it to have any existence but when it is smelled.\" Inquiry into the Human Mind, ch. 2. sect. 2.\nOf Perception be at least as probable as any which has yet been invented to account for the perception of external objects by means of the organs of sense. Be this as it may, experience informs us, that whatever be the nature of those impressions and changes which are made by external objects upon the senses, nerves, and brain, we have without them no actual sensation, and of course perceive nothing ab extra. Hence it has been supposed, that the mind is wholly passive in sensation, and that sensation is necessarily produced by those impressions. But this we believe to be a mistake. Every man who has been attentive to his own thoughts and actions, must know instances of impressions having been certainly made upon his organs of sense without producing any sensation, or forgetting to his mind the perception of the particular objects by which the impressions were caused. His whole mind is intensely employed in any particular pursuit, may have his eyes open upon an object which he does not see; or he may not hear the sound of a clock striking within two yards of him: Nay, we will venture to affirm, that there is hardly one reader of this article to whom such absences of sensation have not often occurred. Now, as there is no reason to suppose, that in the case the undulations of the air, caused by the striking of the clock, did not reach his ears, or that in the other rays of light, reflected from the object, did not fall upon his eyes, which were open to receive them; the only reason which can be assigned for his not having, in these instances, had audible and visible sensations, is, that his mind was so engaged in something else as not to pay to the vibrations in his brain that attention, if we may say, without which impressions ab extra can produce no sensation. There are, indeed, some impressions on the organs of sense so violent and so sudden, as to force themselves upon the mind however employed. Such are those made on the ear by thunder, and on the eye by strong light. In these cases, sensation is involuntary and unavoidable; whence we conclude, not that in such instances the mind is passive or destitute of energy, but that by the violent agitation given to the brain, it is roused from its reverie, and compelled to give attention. It appears, therefore, that in sensation the mind exerts some kind of energy; for in nothing but in the sentient being itself can we seek for the cause why, when all external circumstances are the same, organic impressions sometimes produce sensations and sometimes not; and that cause can only be the energy of the mind; what kind of energy, we pretend not to say.\n\nSect. II. Of Perception by the Senses.\n\nHow the correspondence is carried on between the thinking principle within us and the material world without us, has always, as Dr Reid observes, been found a very difficult problem to those philosophers who consider themselves as obliged to account for every phenomenon in nature. It is, indeed, a problem of which we expect not to see a complete solution. A few steps beyond the vulgar we may certainly go; but the nature of that connexion by which the mind and body are united, will probably remain for ever unknown. One question, however, which has employed much of the attention of philosophers, both ancient and modern, appears to be not wholly unanswerable. It is, Whether by means of our senses we perceive external objects immediately or immediately; or in other words, Whether sensation and perception be one and the same thing, or two things succeeding each other? On this subject, till of late, there appears to have been in the main a great uniformity in the sentiments of philosophers, notwithstanding their variations respecting particular points. Of some of the most eminent of them, we shall give the opinions as we find them collected by one* who is well acquainted with their writings, who is thoroughly qualified to estimate their respective merits, and who cannot be suspected of partiality to that theory which we feel ourselves compelled to adopt.\n\n\"Plato illustrates our manner of perceiving external objects thus: He supposes a dark subterranean cave, in which men lie bound in such a manner as that Plato; they can direct their eyes only to one part of the cave. Far behind there is a light, of which some rays come over a wall to that part of the cave which is before the eyes of our prisoners. A number of men variously employed pass between them and the light, whose shadows are seen by the prisoners, but not their persons themselves. In this manner did that philosopher conceive that by our senses we perceive not things themselves, but only the shadows of things; and he seems to have borrowed his notions on this subject from the disciples of Pythagoras.\n\n\"If we make due allowance for Plato's allegorical genius, his sentiments with respect to sensation and perception correspond very well with those of the Peripatetics. Aristotle, the founder of that school, seems to have thought, that the soul consists of two or three parts, or rather that we have three souls\u2014the vegetable, the animal, and the rational. The animal soul he held to be a certain form of the body, which is inseparable from it, and perishes at death. To this soul the senses belong; and he defines a sense to be that which is capable of receiving the sensible forms, or species of objects, without any of the matter of them; as wax receives the form of the seal without any of its matter. Of this doctrine it seems to be a necessary consequence, that bodies are constantly sending forth, in all directions, as many different kinds of forms without matter as they have different sensible qualities. This was accordingly maintained by the followers of Aristotle, though not, as far as we know, taught by himself. They disputed concerning the nature of these forms or species, whether they were real beings or nonentities: but of matter and form we shall have occasion to speak afterwards.\n\n\"After Aristotle had kept possession of the schools for more than a thousand years, his authority, which Cartes had often supplied the place of argument, was called in question by Lord Bacon and others. Des Cartes, however, was the first philosopher who, convinced of the defects of the prevailing system, attempted to form another entirely new: but on the nature of perception by means of the senses he differs little or nothing from those who had preceded him in that department of science. He denies, indeed, and refutes by solid reasoning, the doctrine which maintains that images, species, or forms of external objects, come from the objects themselves, and enter into the mind by the avenues...\"\nOf Percep-\ntion.\n\navenues of the senses. But he takes it for granted, as all the old philosophers had done, that what we immediately perceive must be either in the mind itself, or in the brain, in which the mind is immediately present. The impressions made upon our organs, nerves, and brain, can be nothing, according to his philosophy, but various modifications of extension, figure, and motion. There can be nothing in the brain like found or colour, taste or smell, heat or cold. These are sensations in the mind, which, by the laws of the union of the soul and body, are raised on occasion of certain traces in the brain; and although he sometimes gives the name of ideas to these traces, he does not think it necessary that they should be perfectly like the things which they represent, any more than that words and signs should resemble the things which they signify.\n\nAccording to this system it would appear, that we perceive not external objects directly by means of our senses; but that these objects, operating either immediately or immediately upon the organs of sense, and they again upon our nerves and brain, excite in the mind certain sensations; whence we infer the existence of external objects from our sensations of which they are the cause. Perception of external objects, therefore, according to Des Cartes, is not one simple original act of the mind, but may be resolved into a process of reasoning from effects to causes.\n\nThe doctrines of Malebranche, Locke, and Hartley, respecting perception, differ not essentially from that of Des Cartes. Malebranche, indeed, supposes, that external objects are not themselves the causes of perception; but that the Deity, being always present to our minds more intimately than any other being, does, upon occasion of the impressions made upon our organs of sense, discover to us, as far as he thinks proper, and according to fixed laws, his own ideas of the object: and thus, according to him, we see all things in God, or in the divine ideas. He agrees, however, with Des Cartes and the ancient philosophers, in considering it as a truth which it is impossible to refute, that we perceive not the objects without us, the sun, moon, and stars, &c., because it is not likely that the soul falls out of the body, and takes a walk, as it were, through the heavens to contemplate these objects. She sees them not therefore by themselves; and the immediate object of the mind, when it sees the sun, is not the sun itself, but something which is intimately united to the mind, and is that which he calls an idea.\n\nLocke, speaking of the reality of our knowledge, says: \"It is evident the mind knows not things immediately, but only by the intervention of the ideas it has of them. Our knowledge, therefore, according to him, is real only so far as there is a conformity between our ideas and the things which they represent.\"\n\nThe manner of our perceiving external objects he illustrates by the following similitude: \"Methinks the understanding is not much unlike a closet wholly shut from light, with only some little opening left, to let in external visible resemblances or ideas of things without. Would the pictures coming into such a dark room but stay there, and lie so orderly as to be found upon occasion, it would very much resemble the understanding of a man in reference to all objects of sight, and the ideas of them.\" He has elsewhere defined an idea thus: \"Whatsoever the mind perceives in itself, or is the immediate object of perception, thought, or understanding, that I call an idea; and the power to produce any idea in our mind, I call finding quality of the subject wherein the power is.\" He likewise thinks it \"easy to draw this observation, that the ideas of what he calls primary qualities of bodies, viz. extension, solidity, figure, mobility, &c., are resemblances of these qualities as they really exist in the bodies themselves.\"\n\nThis unguarded expression, which affirms that ideas in the mind are the resemblances of external things, has brought upon Mr Locke much undeserved ridicule. That on this and other occasions he uses the word idea with too great latitude, and that he often confounds ideas with sensations, and even with the causes of sensation, must be admitted by his warmest admirers: but we believe, that by an attentive reader, who peruses his whole work, and compares such passages as are obscure with those which are clearer, his meaning may always be discovered, and with respect to sensation and perception will generally be found just. That by calling the ideas of primary qualities resemblances of the qualities themselves, he meant nothing more than that bodies in all possible states impress the senses, nerves, and brain, in such a manner as to produce in the mind certain sensations, between which and those impressions there is an inseparable, though unknown, connection, is evident from the account which he gives of the manner of perception. \"Our senses (says he), conversant about particular sensible objects, do convey into the mind several distinct perceptions of things, according to those various ways in which these objects affect them: and thus we come by those ideas we have of yellow, white, heat, cold, soft, hard, bitter, sweet, and all those which we call sensible qualities; which when I say the senses convey into the mind, I mean, they from external objects convey into the mind what produces those perceptions.\" And as bodies can act only by impulse, he adds, that \"those perceptions can be produced only by an impression made upon the senses, and some motion thence continued by our nerves to the brain or seat of perception.\"\n\nDr Hartley was the pupil of Locke and Newton, and has, in a more satisfactory manner than all who had preceded or have since followed him, explained the material part of the process of perception. His principles we shall have occasion, during the course of the article, to develop pretty fully. For our present purpose it is sufficient to say, that all his observations and arguments evidently suppose, that nothing distant from the mind can be perceived in the immediate act of sensation; but that the apparently immediate perception of external objects is an instance of early and deep-rooted association.\n\nIn this sentiment Mr Hume agrees with his predecessor; but he obscures his philosophy, and misleads his reader, by confounding sensations with the impressions from which they proceed. \"Every one (says he) will allow, that there is a considerable difference between the perceptions of the mind, when a man feels the pain of excessive heat, or the pleasure of moderate warmth, and when he afterwards recalls to his memory this sensation, or anticipates it by his imagination.\"\nChap. I.","sp":158,"ep":171},{"h":"METAPHYSICS","t":"The least forcible and lively of these perceptions he with great propriety calls ideas; but it is either through willful perverseness, or confusion of intellect, that he chooses to call the others impressions. Sensation and perception are caused by impressions; but they are no more impressions themselves, than the pain occasioned by the stroke of a bludgeon is the stroke itself, or the bludgeon with which it was struck. But more of this afterwards.\n\nThus far, then, that we perceive not external objects directly, but infer their existence from certain sensations excited in our minds by the operation of these objects upon our senses, nerves and brain, seems to have been the opinion of every philosopher from Pythagoras to Mr. Hume. For an opinion so universal, and at the same time contrary to the persuasion of the multitude, some cogent reason must have been assigned. That reason has been given by many philosophers, but by none with greater perspicuity than Dr. Porterfield, in his Essay concerning the Motion of the Eyes. \"How body acts upon the mind, or mind upon body (says he), I know not; but this I am very certain of, that nothing can act, or be acted upon, where it is not; and therefore, our mind can never perceive anything but its own proper modifications, and the various states of the sensorium to which it is present. So that it is not the external sun and moon, which are in the heavens, that our mind perceives, but only their image or representation impressed on the sensorium. How the soul of a seeing man feels those images, or how it receives those ideas from such agitations in the sensorium, I know not; but I am sure it can never perceive the external bodies themselves to which it is not present.\"\n\nThis reasoning appears to have force; and, perhaps, the unanimous agreement of thinking men in all ages has still greater force; yet the doctrine which prevailed so long, and which to Locke appeared so evident as to need no proof, has been since called in question by some eminent philosophers of our own country; who, though they allow that we cannot perceive external objects but by means of the senses, yet affirm that they are the objects themselves which we perceive directly; and that in perception there is no affection which can be resolved into a process of reasoning from sensations the effects, to external objects the causes. Dr. Reid, who was perhaps the first, and is unquestionably the ablest of this class of philosophers, had expressed himself on the subject as follows:\n\n\"If we attend to the act of our mind, which we call the perception of an external object of sense, we shall find in it these three things: First, Some conception or notion of the object perceived. Secondly, A strong and irresistible conviction and belief of its present existence. And, Thirdly, That this conviction and belief are immediate, and not the effect of reasoning.\" To the first and second of these propositions, we are persuaded that Des Cartes and Locke would readily have assented; nor do we imagine that they would have denied the third, had the author allowed that this strong and irresistible conviction is the consequence of an early and deep-rooted association resolvable into a process of reasoning. This, however, the learned professor does not allow; for he repeatedly affirms, that it is instinctive and original, and that \"the constitution of our power of perception determines us to hold the existence of what we distinctly perceive as a first principle, from which other truths may be deduced, but it is deduced from none.\" With this view of the matter, he could with no propriety attempt to support his own opinion by argument; but to the reasonings of Dr. Porterfield and others in defence of the Cartesian theory, he replies in the following words: \"That nothing can act immediately where it is not, I think must be admitted (D); for I agree with Sir Isaac Newton, that power without substance is inconceivable. It is a consequence of this, that nothing can be acted upon immediately where the agent is not present; let this, therefore, be granted. To make the reasoning conclusive, it is farther necessary, that when we perceive objects, either they act upon us, or we act upon them. This does not appear self-evident, nor have I ever met with any proof of it.\"\n\nOf the profundity of Dr. Reid's understanding, we have the most firm conviction; nor is there any metaphysician, ancient or modern, from whom we differ with greater reluctance; but we cannot help thinking this a very rash assertion, as his own works appear to us to afford complete proof, that, in perception, the mind both acts and is acted upon. Let us attend, however, to the reasons which, on this occasion, induced\n\n(d) One of the most celebrated of Dr. Reid's followers thinks otherwise. \"That no distant subject can act upon the mind, is a proposition (says Lord Kames) which undoubtedly requires evidence; for it is not intuitively certain: And, therefore, till the proposition be demonstrated, every man may without scruple rely upon the conviction of his senses, that he hears and sees things at a distance.\" But his Lordship ought to have known, that Locke and Berkeley, the two philosophers whom he was combating, have nowhere called in question the conviction of their senses. They do not, indeed, admit, that the external organs are themselves percipient, or that by means of them the mind can immediately perceive distant objects; but they have nowhere denied, that through the medium of them the mind comes to the knowledge of external existence. And the reasons which they assign for this twofold opinion are, that in perception they experience action or the effects of action, which is not their own; and that it is an intuitive truth, that nothing can act where it is not present. \"But admitting (says his Lordship) that no being can act but where it is, is there any thing more simple or more common, than the acting upon subjects at a distance by intermediate means?\" This holds in fact with respect both to seeing and hearing. It certainly does, and with respect to the other senses likewise; but it is the very thing for which Locke and Berkeley would have contended, had any man in their days presumed to call it in question. It is the very foundation of their system; and if it be granted, nothing can be more evident, than that external existence is not the immediate object of perception. See Appendix to Elements of Criticism.\nOf Perceived him to think, that in perception there is no action either of the object on the mind or of the mind on the object.\n\n\"When we say, that one being acts upon another, we mean, that some power or force is exerted by the agent, which produces, or has a tendency to produce, a change in the thing acted upon. If this be the meaning of the phrase, as I conceive it is, there appears no reason for asserting, that in perception, either the object acts upon the mind or the mind upon the object. An object, in being perceived, does not act at all. I perceive the walls of the room where I sit; but they are perfectly inactive, and therefore act not upon the mind. To be perceived, is what logicians call an external denomination, which implies neither action nor quality in the object perceived.\"\n\nThis last sentence we pretend not to understand. Substance without qualities is to us inconceivable, and certainly is no object of perception; for Dr Reid himself has told us, and told us truly, that \"the objects of perception are the various qualities of bodies.\" That an object in being perceived does not act at all, is directly contrary to what the ingenious author has taught us, both in his Inquiry and in his Essays, viz. that \"it is a law of our nature that we perceive not external objects, unless certain impressions be made by the object upon the organ, and by means of the organ upon the nerve and brain;\" for if the external object in being perceived make impressions, it is certainly not true that it acts not at all. It is indeed readily acknowledged, that when one perceives the walls of the room where he sits, these walls do not act immediately upon the organs of sight; but it does not, therefore, follow, that they are perfectly inactive; for it is known to all mankind, that from every point of the wall which is seen, rays of light are reflected to the eye; that those rays make upon the retina an impression, which is conveyed by the optic nerve to the brain; and that this impression on the brain is one of the immediate causes of vision. In what particular manner it causes vision, we shall never be able to discover, till we know more of the laws which unite mind and body, and by which one of these is qualified to act upon the other; but because we know not the manner of this operation, to affirm that there is no operation at all seems to be as absurd as it would be to affirm, because we perceive no necessary connexion between a stroke and the sensation of sound, that the sound of a musical string is not caused by the stroke of a plectrum. That God might have given us powers of perception of a different kind from those which we possess, there can be no doubt; but with what we might have been, we have no concern. As we are, we know perfectly that the eye is an instrument of vision, because without it nothing can be seen; we know also, that the retina and optic nerves are equally necessary; because if they be disordered, vision is still wanting; we know likewise, that the brain is necessary to all perception; because, when it is disordered, thinking either entirely ceases, or is proportionably disturbed. And, lastly, We are not more certain of our own existence, than that actual perception takes place but when the object makes an impression upon some organ of sense: for when no rays of light fall upon the eye, we see nothing; when no rapid body is applied to the tongue and palate, we taste nothing; and if we could be removed from everything solid, we would feel nothing. These are conclusions which cannot be controverted. They are admitted equally by the philosopher and by the plain unlettered man of common sense; nor are they rendered one whit less certain by our not being able to go a step farther, so as to discover in what manner the brain or the affections of it can be the immediate instrument of sensation and perception. For (as Dr Reid, in the spirit of true philosophy, observes), \"in the operations of mind, as well as in those of bodies, we must often be satisfied with knowing that certain things are connected and invariably follow one another, without being able to discover the chain that goes between them. It is to such connexions that we give the name of laws of nature; and when we say that one thing produces another by a law of nature, this signifies no more than that one thing which we call in popular language the cause, is constantly and invariably followed by another which we call the effect; and that we know not how they are connected.\n\nIn the preceding section we have observed, that in sensation the mind exerts some energy; and therefore, as on every hypothesis perception is a consequence of sensation, it follows, that in perception the mind cannot be wholly inactive. Dr Reid, in his Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man, seems to affirm that it is, \"I see no reason (says he) to believe, that in perception the mind acts upon the object. To perceive an object is one thing, to act upon it is another: Nor is the last at all included in the first. To say that I act upon the wall, by looking at it, is an abuse of language, and has no meaning.\" This is indeed true; it would be a great abuse of language to say, that by looking at the wall a man acts upon it; but we do not believe that any man ever said or supposed such a thing. The philosophers, whose opinion he is combating, might argue in this manner. We are conscious that in perception the mind is active; nothing can act immediately where it is not; the mind cannot act immediately upon external existence: external existence, therefore, is not the immediate object of that energy which is exerted in perception. As Dr Reid affirms that external existence is the immediate object of perception, he must deny the first proposition in this argument; for if it be granted, as we have just seen that in his reply to Dr Porterfield he admits the second, the laws of reasoning will compel him to admit the third. To say, that in perception the mind acts not upon external objects, is a truth in which all mankind are agreed; and it is the very principle from which his antagonists infer, that the conviction of the present existence of external objects is not an original and instinctive consequence of sensation, but an early and deep-rooted association which may be resolved into a process of reasoning. His meaning, therefore, must be, that in perception the mind acts not at all; but this is directly contrary to his definition of perception, which he calls an act of the mind; it is likewise contrary to his theory of perception, as it is detailed in the Inquiry into the Human Mind on the principles of Common Sense. We are there taught, with equal elegance and perspicuity, \"that an impression made by an external object upon the organ, nerves, and brain, is\nOf Perception is followed by a sensation, and that this sensation is followed by the perception of the object.\" We are likewise taught, that \"although the Peripatetics had no good reason to suppose an active and passive intellect, they yet came nearer the truth, in holding the mind to be, in sensation, partly passive and partly active, than the moderns in affirming it to be purely passive. Sensation, imagination, memory, and judgement, have by the vulgar, in all ages, been considered as acts of the mind. The manner in which they are expressed in all languages shows this: for when the mind is much employed in them, we say, it is very active; whereas, if they were impressions only, we ought to say that the mind is very passive.\" All this is undeniable; but if sensation necessarily precede perception, and if in sensation the mind be active, what becomes of the assertion, that in perception it acts not at all? Indeed we may appeal to the common sense of mankind, whether any thing can be perceived without some mental energy of the percipient. For when the impressions made on the external senses are faint, in order to be conscious of them an evident exertion is requisite, not of the organ only, but also of the mind, as in perceiving very remote objects and sounds; but when the impressions are stronger, the perception is involuntary and unavoidable, as has been already explained in the preceding section.\n\nIt being thus certain that in perception the mind both acts and is acted upon, and it being universally acknowledged that nothing can act where it is not, we feel ourselves compelled to admit with the Cartesians, that in perception the conviction of the present existence of external objects is not original and instinctive, but the consequence of an early and unavoidable association of certain sensations with the causes which produce them. In this opinion we are still more confirmed by the well-known fact, that particular pressures upon the organ, nerves, and brain, excite not only sensations, but even perceptions of objects apparently external, when no such objects are within the reach of our senses. Thus \u00a7, if a man in the dark press either corner of his eye with his finger, he will see a circle of colours like those in the feather of a peacock's tail, though no such external object be before him, and though the room be so dark that nothing external could possibly be seen. Again, If a burning coal be nimbly moved round in a circle, with gyrations continually repeated, the whole circumference of the circle will at once appear on fire, though it is certain that there can be really no fire but one portion of that circumference, equal in length to the diameter of the coal. These are facts known to all mankind; and they are perfectly irreconcilable with the supposition, that the perception of external objects by the sense of sight is original and instinctive; but they are at once accounted for, if it be true that rays of light falling from external objects upon the retina tunicia agitate the optic nerves and brain, and that such agitations excite sensations in the mind which experience has taught us to refer to external objects, as, under God, their ultimate cause.\n\nBut though we have declared ourselves to be in this instance Cartesians, we do not admit all the absurdities which have sometimes been imputed to that system of perception. We do not believe that external objects are perceived by means of images of them in the mind or the brain; nor do we think that Des Cartes or Locke has anywhere affirmed that they are, otherwise than by an expression obviously figurative, denoting, not that the actual shapes of things are delineated in the brain or upon the mind, but only that impressions of some kind or other are conveyed to the brain by means of the organs of sense and their corresponding nerves; and that between these impressions and the sensations excited in the mind, there is a real, and in our present state a necessary, though unknown, connexion.\n\nUpon the whole, we think that there is good evidence for believing, that in perception the processes of nature are as follows: Firstly, If the object be not in contact with the organ of sense, there must be some medium which passes between them; as, in vision, the rays of light; in hearing, the vibrations of elastic air; and in smelling, the effluvia of the body smelled; otherwise we have neither sensation nor perception. Secondly, There must be some action or impression upon the organ of sense, either by the immediate application of the object, as in the two senses of touch and taste; or by the medium that goes between them, as in the other three senses. Thirdly, The nerves which go from the brain to the organ, must receive some impression by means of that which was made upon the organ; and by means of these nerves that impression must be carried to the brain. Fourthly, The impression made upon the organ, nerves, and brain, rouses the dormant energy of the mind; and this double action of the mind and the object produces a sensation. And, Lastly, As we know by experience that the mind alone cannot, by any exertion of its own, produce one sensation, and are intuitively certain that nothing can begin to exist without a cause, we infer from the existence of any new sensation the existence of some other cause than the internal energy of the mind, from which that sensation proceeds; and this cause experience teaches us to be the external object. This process is carried on so rapidly, and the several parts of it, by being continually repeated, are so closely associated, that except by a reflex act of the mind we distinguish them not from one another, and therefore we denominate the whole perception.\n\nIt is with extreme diffidence that we advance a doctrine which Dr Reid has controverted; but he differs from Dr Hartley's Observations on Man.\nObjects of lief of this quality, is what in this case I call perception. Again (he says) that \"three of our senses, viz. smell, taste, and hearing, originally give us only certain sensations, and a conviction that these sensations are occasioned by some external object. We give a name to that quality of the object by which it is fitted to produce such a sensation, and connect that quality with the object and with its other qualities. Thus we learn, that a certain sensation of smell is produced by a rose; and that quality in the rose by which it is fitted to produce this sensation we call the smell of the rose. Here it is evident that the sensation is original. The perception that the rose has that quality which we call its smell, is acquired.\"\n\nTo this doctrine no Cartesian could possibly object; for it is the very account which Descartes himself would have given of perception by the organ of smell, as it resolves such a perception into an early association between a certain sensation and that external quality from which we know by experience that the sensation proceeds. Indeed this excellent author repeatedly affirms, that every different perception is conjoined with a sensation which is proper to it; and that the one is the sign, and the other the thing signified. He likewise doubts*, whether children, from the time that they begin to use their senses, make a distinction between things which are only conceived or imagined, and things which really exist. But if the conviction of the present existence of external objects were in perception instinctive, we cannot see how there could be room for such a doubt; for the mere senses of children are as perfect as those of full grown men; and they know well the difference between actually feeling their senses and only thinking of that operation, though they be not capable of expressing that difference in language.\n\nBut if in perception our conviction of the present existence of external objects be not instinctive, what, it may be asked, is the evidence that such objects really exist? This question we shall partly answer in the following section, and more completely when we come to examine Berkeley's theory of the non-existence of matter: but from what has been said already, it is sufficiently evident, that every sensation compels us to believe in the present existence of something different from ourselves, as well as from our sensations.\n\nSect. III. Of the Objects of each Sense respectively.\n\nHITHERTO we have considered sensation and perception in general, and shown that it is not by instinct that we perceive the existence of external objects. This will appear more clearly, if we can ascertain the precise nature of that information which each sense affords us: and in order to this, we shall begin with the sense of touch, not only because it is that which is certainly first exercised, but also because there is a meaning in which all the others may be resolved into it.\n\nBy means of touch we perceive many things, of which the chief are, heat and cold, hardness and softness, roughness and smoothness, extension, figure, solidity, and motion. Of these perceptions, some are of heat and immediate; and others, as we are persuaded, early are perceptions, which may be resolved into a process of ceived reasoning. The perceptions of heat and cold are immediately. When a person for the first time in his life approaches the fire, he feels heat; and when he is first exposed to the frost, he feels cold. What are heat and cold, and where do they reside? They are obviously the reverse of each other; but are they external objects, or mere sensations in the mind? They are undoubtedly sensations which have no existence but when they are felt. To every man not altogether a stranger to these speculations, this proposition is self-evident; but to the bulk of the people it appears an extravagant paradox. To make it plain, however, to the meanest capacity, it is sufficient to observe, that at a certain distance the fire has no perceptible influence upon any person; if that distance be lessened, we feel an agreeable warmth; approach a little nearer, and the warmth becomes disagreeable; and still nearer, it will rise to pain. No man supposes the pain inflicted by a sword to exist in the sword, or anywhere else but in a sentient being. It is equally absurd to suppose pain to exist in fire, or anywhere else but in a sentient being. But that which at one distance is pain, at another is only agreeable warmth; and since warmth and pain are only different degrees of the same feeling, it is equally absurd to suppose the one as the other in the fire. What then is the object of sense when we feel heat? There is obviously no object beyond the present sensation.\n\nBut has the sensation of heat no cause independent of us? Undoubtedly it has, and experience teaches us that the cause is in the fire. We know that we cannot produce the sensation of heat in ourselves by any mental energy of our own; and we are intuitively certain, that nothing can begin to exist without some cause. A man on the top of a mountain covered with snow, may imagine or remember what he felt when in the neighbourhood of fire, and thus have in his mind what is called an idea of heat; but that idea will not warm him (x) like the actual sensation, which no exertion of his own can in such circumstances produce. When he leaves the mountain, however, and approaches the fire, he feels the sensation actually produced, and produced as often as he makes the experiment. He is, therefore, under the necessity of inferring, that in the fire there is some power or quality which, acting either immediately or immediately upon his sense of touch, excites the feeling which is called heat. What that power is, we shall perhaps never be able to discover; but it is self-evident, that it is neither heat nor the resemblance of\n\n---\n\n(E) \u2014Who can hold a fire in his hand,\nBy thinking on the frothy Caucasus?\nOr cloy the hungry edge of appetite,\nBy bare imagination of a feast?\n\nOr wallow naked in December's snow,\nBy thinking on fantastic summer's heat?\nOh no! the apprehension of the good\nGives but the greater feeling to the worse.\n\nK. Richard II.\nObjects of heat, though in vulgar language it is known by that name.\n\nThe same reasoning holds goods with respect to cold. There is at certain times, and in certain countries, some power in the air which congeals water and causes cold; but that power is as different from the sensation of cold, as the power of fire is different from the sensation of heat, or the point of a sword from a flesh wound.\n\nBy the sense of touch we perceive extension, figure, solidity, &c., but we do not perceive them immediately as we perceive heat and cold; for extension, figure, and solidity, are not sensations. Those perceptions then must be acquired; and more clearly to ascertain the manner in which we acquire them, let us suppose a man from his birth destitute of the sense of sight and the power of local motion, but possessed of intellect and every other faculty which we enjoy.\u2014Such a person, it is obvious, would be capable of every sensation and perception which is original to us, except the perception of colours; but we doubt whether it would be possible to give him perceptions of extension, figure, and solidity. Let us try; and as he cannot move a single limb or member of himself, let us suppose a solid substance of small dimensions to be gently pressed against any part of his body; what would such pressure communicate to him? We think it could communicate nothing but a new sensation, to which, as it is neither pleasing nor painful, no name has hitherto been given, except the general one of feeling. This sensation he would not know whether to refer to an external or internal cause; or rather he could have no notion whatever of an external cause, though he would at the same time be conscious that the new sensation was not excited by any energy of his own will. Were the pressure to be gradually increased till it rose to pain, our blind man would still be conscious of nothing but a sensation, which could not lead him to the notion of extension, figure, or solidity, because mere sensations cannot be conceived as either solid or extended. Let us next suppose the pressure to be applied successively to different parts of his body; he would now indeed be conscious of successive sensations, but he could not assign to them either extension or place: for it has been already shown that the external parts of the body are not themselves sentient; and it shall be shown afterwards, that to a man who has never perceived motion, place is absolutely inconceivable.\n\nLastly, let us suppose the dimensions of the pressing substance to be greatly enlarged; what would then follow? nothing, we apprehend, but an increase of pain: for though his whole body were pressed ab extra, the pressure could affect the individual being which is sentient, not more extensively, but only more violently. It appears, therefore, that a man blind from his birth, and destitute of the power of local motion, could never be made to perceive extension, figure, or solidity.\n\nLet us now suppose this man to receive by a miracle the use of his limbs, and to be suddenly prompted, by some instinctive impulse, to arise and walk. So long as he met with no obstacle in his way, he would not, we apprehend, acquire by this exercise any correct notions of extension or figure; but were a stone or log of wood of considerable dimensions to be laid across his usual walk, the case would soon be altered. He would feel himself interrupted in his course, and he would at the same instant recognize his wonted sensations of touch. After being twice or thrice thus interrupted, he would learn from experience that the interruption or resistance proceeded from the same cause which in this instance communicated to him the sensation of feeling; and were he to run his hand along the surface of the log or stone, he would perceive the resistance and the sensation continued. As every effect must have an adequate cause, this continued resistance would compel him to believe the continuity of something external in every direction in which he felt his hand resisted; but such continuity of being is all that is meant by the word extension. At the very same time, and by the very same means, he would gradually acquire the perception of figure; for by running his hand in every direction over the surface of the obstacle which opposed him, he would soon perceive it on all sides limited; but the limits of extension is a phrase of precisely the same import with figure. It appears, therefore, that without the power of local motion, men could never, by the sense of touch, acquire the notions of extension and figure; and the same will be found to be the case with respect to hardness and softness.\n\nWhen we press our hand gently against a stock or a stone, we feel a sensation which is neither painful and softness, nor pleasing. When we press it more violently, the impression becomes painful, and we experience in the received object a resistance which we have not power to overcome. When we press butter or pomatum very gently, we have a sensation in all respects similar to that which we felt when we gently touched the stock or the stone. But when we press the butter with violence, we feel no pain, and experience little resistance; for the parts of which it is composed give way before the hand, though the parts of the stock or the stone remained fixed and immovable. That the parts of one body should thus resist a pressure to which the parts of another so readily yield, must proceed from some difference in the texture of the two bodies: for by the sense of touch we perceive the effects to be different; and are therefore certain that they must proceed either from different causes, or from the same cause operating with different degrees of force. That particular texture which makes the parts of a stone resist the pressure of touch, we call hardness; and the texture which makes the parts of butter or pomatum give way to touch, we call softness. But what hardness and softness are in themselves, touch cannot inform us; for they are neither sensations, nor similar to sensations. We acquire, however, by experience, so complete notions of hardness and softness, that every one who understands the English language perfectly knows the meaning of these words as soon as he hears them; and when he is told that one body is hard and another soft, he knows with absolute certainty that the meaning of the assertion is, that the parts of the body which is said to be hard are held together by some unknown cause operating forcibly, and that the parts of the other are held together by the same or a similar cause operating with less force.\n\nWe acquire the notions of roughness and smoothness in the very same way and by the very same means that we\nwe acquire ideas of extension and figure. To describe the process at large would certainly be superfluous; for if what we have said concerning our perceptions of extension and figure be just and intelligible, every one will, without farther assistance, discover for himself how he perceives roughnesses and smoothnesses. Motion shall be considered among the adjuncts of body; but in order to understand what body itself is, it will be necessary, before we dismiss the sense of touch, to inquire how we come by the notion of solidity.\n\nSolidity is one of those notions, or, in the language of Locke, one of those ideas, which are commonly said to be acquired by the sense of touch. That touch gives the first hint towards our notion of solidity, is certainly true; but that hint must be afterwards improved by the intellect, or we never could have an adequate knowledge of what is meant when anything is said to be absolutely solid. We know by experience, that we can at pleasure open and shut our empty hand without meeting with any resistance. We know likewise, that when we grasp an ivory ball of three or four inches diameter, no force which we can exert will bring together the several parts of the hand, which were easily brought together when we grasped nothing. In this way do we acquire our first notion of solidity; for that word denotes nothing more in this instance than the power or property of the ball, by which our fingers are excluded from the place which it occupies. Solidity differs from hardness in this respect, that hardness results from the strong cohesion of the parts of a hard body, which renders it difficult to change the places of those parts, as they respect one another; whereas solidity respects the whole mass, and is as essential a quality of water as of adamant. A drop of water, indeed, placed between two plane surfaces of marble, will not like adamant preclude their contact; because the parts of a drop of water, cohering but loosely to one another, give way to the pressure, and escape in every lateral direction. But if a drop of water be confined on all sides, as in a globe of gold, we know from experiment that no force will bring the sides of the globe together without forcing the water through the pores of the metal; and hence we infer solidity to be essential to every corporeal substance.\n\nThus then it appears, that of the objects perceived by touch not one is immediately perceived except heat, cold, and other sensations. The sensations, as they are not excited by any internal energy of our own, lead us indeed to something external as their cause; and by comparing the different sensations with each other, and observing what effects their external causes have upon our own motions, we are naturally led to conceive these causes as extended, figured, solid, hard or soft, rough or smooth, &c.; but it is obvious that this conception is the result of experience, and a process of mental reasoning.\n\nOn the senses of taste, smell, and hearing, it is needless to say much. The immediate objects of these are confessedly sensations which have no existence but when they are perceived; though experience teaches us to refer them all to external objects as their respective causes. With respect to smell, this has been made sufficiently evident in the preceding section, and it is not less evident with respect to taste and hearing.\n\nCertain bodies, applied to the tongue and palate, and moistened with the saliva, excite certain sensations of which we call tastes. These sensations, however, are not in the bodies; nor can they have any existence but in a sentient being. They are produced in consequence of impressions on the nerves of the tongue and palate, exciting certain agitations in the brain; but the sensation itself is neither impulse nor agitation. Some substances excite tastes which are agreeable, and others such as are disagreeable; and there are not a few which excite no taste at all. Bodies, which applied to the tongue and palate of one man produce tastes that are agreeable, applied to the same organs of another man give him tastes which are disagreeable; and we have all experienced, that the same substance, which, when the organs are sound, excites a sweet or pleasant taste, has, when the organs were disordered, excited a taste which was bitter or unpleasant. These facts, which cannot be controverted, afford the fullest evidence, if evidence were wanted, that taste, as we feel it, is no quality of bodies, nor has any existence out of the mind.\n\nThe organ of hearing is the ear, and its object is hearing. It is well known, that sound is produced by certain vibrations of the air striking the tympanum of the ear, and that these vibrations are caused by the sonorous body. Sound, however, is not vibration, nor the idea of sound the idea of vibration. Sound considered by itself is a mere sensation, which can have no existence but in a sentient being. We know by experience, that it is caused by something external; but we know likewise that the effect has no resemblance to the cause. Previous to experience we could not refer sound to any external cause; far less could we determine whether it proceeded from an object above us or below us, on our right hand or on our left. It appears to us self-evident, that if a man born deaf were suddenly made to hear, he would consider his first sensation of sound as originating wholly within himself. Between that sensation and the sensations of touch, taste, smell, and sight, there is no resemblance; nor are there any relations among them, which, previous to experience, could induce him to trace them all to external objects as their several causes. Our deaf man might have learned to refer all his other sensations to their true causes, in some such way as we have described under the sense of touch; but sound would be something so new to him, and so totally different from touch, taste, and smell, that he could attribute it to nothing external.\n\nExperience, however, would soon teach him, that it is by the ear is its organ, and the sonorous body its cause; and he would in time learn to distinguish one sound, that is, the sound of a trumpet for instance, from another, suppose different the sound of a bell; and to attribute each to its proper cause, even when neither the trumpet nor the bell-bodies by was perceived by his other senses. With respect to their reasons which we have been accustomed to hear, this is done so instantaneously, that some philosophers have imagined it to be the effect of an instinctive principle in our nature, totally different from experience, and independent of reason. But the fact is not so. Long before we are capable of making sensation and perception objects of reflection, we have heard the sound produced by the ringing of a bell, and seen the object which produced the sound so often, that, when we hear a similar sound\nObjects of sound again, we instantly refer it to a bell, though we see not the bell from which it proceeds; but this is the effect of habit, and not of instinct. Had we never perceived a bell while ringing by either of our senses of sight or touch, we could not by the sense of hearing acquire any notion of the figure or texture of the body from which the cause of the sound proceeds, though we had heard that sound every day of our lives. It is, indeed, by experience only that we learn to distinguish by the ear whether a sonorous body be before or behind us, on our right hand or on our left; for we find it always difficult to say from what precise quarter a strange sound proceeds; and this difficulty would be heightened to impossibility, had not all sounds something in common. Dr. Sparrman relates, that when he first heard the roaring of a lion, he did not know on what side of him to apprehend danger, as the sound seemed to proceed from the ground, and to enclose a circle of which he and his companions stood in the centre. The same thing has happened to every man, when the sound was such as he had never heard before; even though it was neither so loud nor so terrific as the roaring of a lion in a desert wilderness: but with respect to sounds which we are daily hearing on each side of us, we soon learn to distinguish with tolerable accuracy whether they be before or behind us, above or below, on our right hand or on our left. All this, however, is the effect, not of instinct, but of experience improved into habit.\n\nSight is justly considered as the noblest and most comprehensive of all our senses. The reason is obvious: for when a full grown man opens his eyes, he perceives houses, trees, rivers, the earth, sun, and moon, &c., and to each of these objects belong figure, extension, colour, &c., which are all perceived instantly by means of this sense. Yet it is certain, that the sense of sight does not originally communicate to us so many perceptions; and there is abundant evidence, that an infant cannot at first, or for some weeks after its birth, distinguish by vision one object from another. Colour is the proper object of sight, and for some time its only object; but colour as perceived by us is a mere sensation, which can have no existence but in a sentient being. If this proposition stood in need of proof, we might observe that there are men, and even whole families, who possess the sense of sight in a degree of perfection sufficient for all the purposes of life, and yet cannot distinguish certain colours from each other; blue, for instance, from green, or perhaps from red: and there is no man who can distinguish between some particular shades of blue and green by the feeble light of a candle. Were colours the real qualities of body, this mistake of one for another could never be experienced. No man who possesses the sense of touch ever confounded hardness with softness, a sphere with a cube, or an ell with an inch. The reason is, that hardness and softness, figure, and extension, are the qualities of things external; whereas colour being a mere sensation, is nothing but an affection or modification of the sentient being. But it is obvious, that sentient beings, according as they differ from one another, may be differently affected by the same external cause; so that one man may perceive that to be green which all other men perceive to be blue. The immediate external cause of the sensation of colour, is the rays of light reflected from the body, which in common language is said to be coloured. These rays falling upon the pupil of the eye, are refracted differently, according as their incidence is more or less oblique into points on the retina, where they form a picture of the external object; and from this picture, by means of the optic nerve, is communicated to the brain some impulse or agitation, which produces vision or the perception of colour. As rays of light are corporeal substances, it is obvious that they can act upon body only by impulse; but between impulse and the various sensations of red, green, blue, &c., there is no resemblance. For the laws of refraction and refraction, and for the structure of the eye, see Optics and Anatomy. That which we have to inquire into at present is, how we learn, by means of the sense of sight, to perceive the figure, magnitude, motion, and distance of external objects, or indeed to distinguish one object from another.\n\nA ray of light proceeding, as all rays do, in a straight line, must, however great its length, affect the eye, retina, and optic nerve, as if it were a single point. From this obvious and undeniable fact, Bishop Berkeley predicted*, that a man born blind, who should be suddenly made to see, would at first perceive nothing without him, would distinguish neither the distance, size, figure, nor situation, of external objects; that he would only see in his eyes themselves, or, to speak more properly, would only experience new modifications in his mind, until joining touch to sight, he formed thus a communication with the external world, and learned, by the simultaneous exercise of the two senses, that natural language in which the visible is the sign of the tangible. This truth, which was discovered by the bishop merely by contemplating in his own mind the nature of sensation and the known laws of optics, after having been laughed at for more than twenty years as one of the many dreams of a visionary genius, was completely confirmed by the case of the famous patient whom Cheleden cured of a cataract; and that too, though the cataract does not produce total blindness: which makes it evident, that the first visual perceptions of the patient after his recovery could not be wholly new and unmixed. It may indeed be confirmed at any time by a simple experiment made upon an infant. For several weeks after birth, a child flirts not its eyes upon the sudden approach of an object to them, nor shows the least symptom of distinguishing one distance from another; and it is easy by a little attention to observe, how it gradually learns to distinguish objects at greater and greater distances. Indeed colour, or the immediate object of sight, being a mere sensation or affection of the mind, can have no natural relation whatever to anything external.\n\nIt is plain, therefore, that distance is in its own nature imperceptible to the eye, and yet it is often perceived by sight. How is this done? We think, in the following manner. Distance is one mode of acquired tension, which, we have already seen, is perceived by means of touch. Of short distances, our first ideas are doubts acquired by the stretching out and drawing back of our arms; and those ideas are soon connected with certain sensations which we have in actual vision, that the latter instantly suggests the former. Thus,\nObjects of Thus, it is a fact known by experience, that when we look at a near object with both eyes, according as it approaches or recedes from us, we alter the disposition of our eyes, by lessening or widening the interval between the pupils. This disposition, or turn of the eyes, is attended with a sensation of which every man is conscious at the time of vision; and this sensation seems to us to be that which in this case suggests the idea of greater or less distance to the mind. Not that there is any natural or necessary connexion between the sensation of which we are conscious, and greater or less distance; for the sensation is wholly internal, and the distance is external. But because the mind has, by constant experience, found the different sensations occasioned by different dispositions of the eyes to correspond to different degrees of distance in the object, there has grown a habitual or customary connexion between those sensations and the notions of greater or less distance. So that the mind no sooner perceives the sensation arising from the different turn it gives the eyes in order to bring the pupils nearer or farther asunder, than it is instantly impressed with a certain notion of the distance which was wont to be connected with that sensation. Again, an object placed at a certain distance from the eye, to which the breadth of the pupil bears a sensible proportion, being made to approach nearer, is seen more confusedly; and the nearer it is brought, the confusion is always the greater. The reason of all this is known to every optician: but it being constantly experienced by those who never dived into optics, there arises in the mind of every man a habitual connexion between the several degrees of confusion and distance; the greater confusion still implying the less distance, and the less confusion the greater distance. It is of no avail to say, that between confused vision and distance, great or small, there is no necessary connexion; for there is as little connexion between a blush in the face and the mental feeling of shame; and yet no sooner does a man of observation perceive that particular colour in the face of another, than it suggests to him the notion of that feeling or passion with which he has constantly observed it accompanied.\n\nIn these ways, however, we perceive only small distances. Of distances more remote our judgement is formed from other data; and happily these data are not far to seek. It is a fact known to every man who is not totally ignorant of the science of optics, that a greater number of rays fall upon the eye when reflected from a body near at hand, than can fall from the same body at a distance; and as those rays operate by impulse, it is self-evident that the impression must be stronger, and of course the sensation or colour more vivid, when the body is near than when it is distant. Now having acquired the notion of the true distance of objects by motion and the sense of touch, and finding by uniform experience, that as they are near or far off, the sensation or colour which they excite in the mind through the organ of vision is more or less vivid, those degrees of sensation come to be so closely associated with the respective distances of the object, that the one instantly suggests the other.\n\nIt is just so that we perceive figure by sight. Having experienced by the sense of touch that one surface is a square and another a circle, that one body is a cube and another a sphere; and finding our sense of sight differently affected by the square and the circle, by the cube and the sphere; these different affections come to be so closely connected in our minds with the figures of the respective bodies, that long before we are capable of reasoning on the subject the one is never present to us without suggesting the other. Nay, to complete this case is the connexion or association, that we cannot even in idea abstract the colour from the figure; though it is certain that colour is a mere sensation, and figure an external quality; that colour alone is immediately perceivable by the eye, and the notion of figure suggested by the colour. We are aware that it has been affirmed, and affirmed with great vehemence, that figures of two dimensions are immediately perceived by the eye, and perceived with greater accuracy than by the sense of touch. But they who insist upon this doctrine affirm likewise, contrary to experience and the clearest reasoning, that the immediate objects of sight are external, and that colour is a quality of bodies. In the arguments too by which they support their hypothesis, they seem to confound sight as an affection of the mind, with the picture on the bottom of the eye, as if the retina were the sentient being; whereas the retina and picture are no more than intruments of sensation. It is indeed a fact, that the picture has the same figure nearly with the plane of the object which is presented to the eye; as when the object is a sphere, the picture is a circle variegated in colour. It is likewise a fact, that the picture is enlarged in proportion as the object is brought near, and diminished as it is carried to a distance. But these facts are known only to persons skilled in optics; and therefore it is evident, that though calculations may be raised from them by mathematicians to determine the distance and figure of external objects, they cannot possibly be the data from which distance and figure are inferred by the vulgar, who know not that such pictures on the retina exist. Besides all this, it is universally known, that a painter, by laying on his colours properly, can make a plain square surface appear to the eye in certain positions as an oblong or as a cube, and a plain circular surface as a concave or a convex hemisphere. But not one of these things could possibly be done, were figure, or indeed anything else than colour, the immediate object of vision.\n\nAs we see distance and figure, so we see magnitude; and we see both in the same way that we see shame or anger in the looks of a man. The impression made upon the bottom of the eye by rays reflected from a large magnitude, must necessarily be different from the impression made by rays reflected from a magnitude that is less. This is self-evident; and since the impression ab extra is in some way or other the cause of that sensation, which is all of which we are originally conscious in vision, it is obvious that the sensation, like every other effect, must correspond to the cause from which it proceeds. Being therefore conscious of different sensations; and having, at an earlier period than we distinctly remember, learned by experience to refer them to different magnitudes; no sooner is each sensation excited than it suggests the notion, or, if you please, the perception, of that magnitude with which it is connected. So completely is this association fixed in the mind, that when we look at a known object, its real\nObjects of real magnitude appears to be as instantly observed as the object itself, which we hardly attend at all to the particularity of the sensation by which the magnitude is suggested. It is indeed customary with writers on optics to distinguish between tangible and visible magnitude, as if any kind of magnitude were the immediate object of vision; but this is not so: for magnitude is something external, whereas the immediate object of vision is a mere sensation. What has introduced into science this mode of speaking is the following fact, that as we approach a distant object it appears to the eye larger and larger every step, and less and less as we recede from it; whereas the tangible magnitude of an object is always the same. The reason of this apparent change of magnitude to the eye, according to the distance at which any particular object is viewed, is, that from a near object rays of light fall in greater numbers and more diverging than from the same object viewed at a distance. This of course alters the nature of the visible sensation: each common sensation is in the mind closely linked with a particular notion of magnitude; and by the exercise of sight and touch we have learned from experience, that the particular sensation caused by diverging rays must be referred to a larger magnitude than that which is caused by parallel rays proceeding from the same distance.\n\nUpon the whole, then, we think ourselves entitled to conclude, that the proper and original objects of vision constitute an universal language of the Author of Nature, by which we are instructed how to regulate our actions, in order to attain those things that are necessary to the preservation and well-being of our bodies, as also to avoid whatever may be hurtful or destructive to them. It is principally by the information of this language that we are guided in all the transactions and concerns of life: And the manner in which it signifies and marks to us the objects which are at a distance, is similar to that of languages and signs of human appointment, which do not suggest the things signified by any likeness or identity of nature, but only by a habitual connexion, which experience has made us to observe, between them. This language of the eye, like the language of the tongue, suggests by one sensation what may be resolved into a variety of perceptions. A tree is composed of a trunk, branches, leaves; it has colour, figure, size; and all these things are at once suggested to the mind by the two words spreading oak. Just so it is with respect to vision: the sensation received by the eye suggests at once the trunk, branches, leaves, colour, figure, and size of the oak, and suggests them all as the qualities of one object.\n\n**Chap. II. Of Retention and Ideas.**\n\nFrom the experiment with the burning coal mentioned in No. 31, it is apparent, that sensations excited through the eye, together with their corresponding perceptions, remain in the mind for a short time after the external exciting cause is removed. The same thing appears from another experiment which was first made by Sir Isaac Newton, and which every man may repeat for his own satisfaction. It is universally known* that a proper mixture of the seven original colours, red, yellow, green, blue, &c., constitutes that uniform appearance which we call white. But when these colours are made to pass in a rapid succession before the eye, they excite the very same perception as when they are properly mixed, which is a satisfactory proof that the impression made by each separate colour remains in the brain until a revolution of all the colours be completed; for nothing but the impression of all the colours at once can produce the sensation and perception of white. Indeed no person capable of paying the proper attention to these things, can keep his eye fixed upon a luminous object, and afterwards shut it, without experiencing that the sensation and perception remain for some time after the external object is shut out, and that they go off gradually till they leave behind them the mental appearance, which is properly called an idea of the object.\n\nThe same continuance of the sensation after the removal of its cause is equally observable in the sense of hearing; for every sound which we hear is reflected by the neighbouring bodies; and therefore consists in reality of a variety of sounds succeeding each other at different distances of time, according to the distances of the several reflecting bodies. Yet this causes no confusion or apparent complexity of sound, unless when the distance of the reflecting bodies is very considerable, as in spacious buildings.\n\nWith respect to the continuance of the sensation of touch, doubts have been started; but for these there is as little room as for doubting the continuance of the sensations of seeing and hearing. The continuance of heat after the heating body is removed, and of the smart of a wound after the instant of infliction, are proofs that every sensation of touch does not vanish with its cause. A man unused to the motion of a ship or a coach, after having been a day at sea or on the road, feels or imagines he feels the rolling of the ship or the jolting of the coach after he is in bed and actually at rest. Of these facts we know not what other account can be given, than that the agitation in the brain, which is the immediate cause of the sensation of touch, remains for some time after the external cause of the agitation is removed.\n\nAs to the senses of taste and smell, Dr Hartley seems to think that there is no clear and direct evidence for the continuance of their sensations after their proper objects are removed: but in this instance the ingenious author does not do justice to his own theory. Let any man eat onions, garlic, or any other thing of a very pungent taste, and immediately wash his mouth with fresh water, so that he may be sure no part of the rapid body remains on his tongue or palate. According to this doctrine, the taste of the onion or garlic should instantly vanish with its object; but the fact is otherwise. Whoever shall make the experiment, will find the sensation to remain a considerable time; not indeed in its original force, but weakened no more than what it must necessarily be by the introduction of a new sensation excited by the water. It is more difficult to ascertain the permanency of smell: but analogy inclines us to believe, that in this particular it resembles the other senses, though we know not how to direct the reader to an experiment which will give him absolute conviction.\n\nWhether the cause of these continued sensations, after the removal of their objects, be in the brain alone,\nRetention in the mind alone considered as an immaterial being, or in both together, is of very little importance; because, taking the mind and its internal organs as one metaphysical whole*, it matters not to our present inquiry, where this retentive power resides, as long as it can be proved to exist within us; for it seems evident, that what has the faculty of retaining a sensation when no longer acted upon by the object which excited it, must also have a power to preserve the vestiges of that sensation even after the sensation itself shall be entirely obliterated. This is in fact the case with the mind. When an object which we have once perceived is most remote from our thoughts, we are certain that there is within us a capacity, disposition, tendency, or power, by which a representation of that object may be at any time revived and presented to the intellect. Thus the same inherent power of the mind and its internal organs, which retains a sensation and perception in the absence of the object by which they were excited, can also reproduce that perception, or bring into the view of the intellect something exactly similar to it. The reproduction will not indeed be so lively as the original perception when accompanied with its corresponding sensation, because sensation and actual perception are affected by a double cause, the action of the external object upon the organs, nerves, and brain, and the corresponding energy of the mind or sentient principle; whereas, in the reproduction, the mind seems to act solely by its own power, and certainly without the assistance of external objects.\n\nThis reproductive power is commonly called memory. By many of the ancient philosophers, and by M. Shewab, with one or two others among the moderns, it is called imagination. We do not choose either to revive antiquated modes of expression, or to introduce innovations of our own; but as we cannot disapprove of the ancient phraseology, after the definitions which the reader will by and by find of imagination, memory, and recollection, as given by Mr Harris, we have prefixed to this chapter the general title of retention, which comprehends them all.\n\nWhen one recalls an object of sight by the power of memory, it appears to him precisely the same as in the original survey, only less distinct, and with a conviction (which is perhaps the result of experience) that the real object is not immediately before him. How is an object recalled by the power of memory? Does the man endeavour to form in his mind a picture or representative image of the object? Let us listen to the answers given by different philosophers to this question.\n\nThe sentiments of the Peripatetics, as expressed by Alexander Aphrodites*, one of the earliest commentators on Aristotle, are thus translated by Mr Harris in his Hermes\u2014\"Now, what fancy or imagination is, we may explain as follows: we may conceive to be formed within us, from the operation of the senses about sensible subjects, some impression (as it were), or picture in our original sensibrium, being a relict of retention that motion caused within us by the external object; a relict which, when the external object is no longer present, remains, and is still preserved, being as it were its image; and which, by being thus preserved, becomes the cause of our having memory. Now such a sort of relict, (and as it were) impregnation, they call fancy or imagination (E).\u201d A passage from Alcinos of the doctrines of Plato, as rendered into English by Dr Reid +, shows, that in this theory, as in that of perception, the Platonists agreed with the Peripatetics. \u201cWhen the form or type of things is impressed on the mind by the organs of the senses, and so imprinted as not to be deleted by time, but preserved firm and lasting, its preservation is called memory.\u201d\n\nMr Harris, who was deeply read in the ancient philosophy, and who considered the authority of Aristotle and Plato as superseding all reasoning and all inquiry, after justly observing, that if the soul had no other faculties than the senses, it could never acquire the least idea of time, thus expresses himself on the subject before us:\u2014\u201cBut happily for us we are not deserted here. We have, in the first place, a faculty called imagination or fancy; which, however as to its energies it may be subsequent to sense, yet is truly prior to it both in dignity and use. This it is which retains the fleeting forms of things, when things themselves are gone, and all sensation is at an end. That this faculty, however connected with sense, is still perfectly different, may be seen from hence. We have an imagination of things that are gone and extinct; but no such things can be made objects of sensation. We have an easy command over the objects of our imagination, and can call them forth in almost whatever manner we please; but our sensations are necessary when their objects are present, nor can we controul them but by removing either the objects or ourselves. As wax would, not be adequate to its business of signature, had it not a power to retain, as well as receive; the same holds of the soul, with respect to sense and imagination. Sense is its receptive power; imagination its retentive. Had it been without imagination, it would not be as wax but as water; where, though all impressions may be instantly made, yet as soon as made they are entirely lost. Thus then, from a view of the two powers taken together, we may call sense (if we please), a kind of transient imagination; and imagination, on the contrary, a kind of permanent sense.\"\n\nGreat part of the office which is here given to imagination, is in common English attributed to memory; but between these two faculties, as well as between them and recollection, the author accurately distinguishes thus:\u2014\u201cWhen we view some relict of memory, sensation repented within us, without thinking of its rise,\u201d etc., refers it to any sensible object, this is fancy or imagination. When we view some such relict, and refer it withal to that sensible object which in time past war\nChap. II.\n\nRetention is cause and original, this is memory. Lastly, The road which leads to memory through a series of ideas however connected, whether rationally or casually, this is recollection.\"\n\nOf this theory we shall only remark, that if we could understand the words picture and form in a metaphorical sense, as candour obliges us to understand Locke's images in the mind, the doctrine of Alexander Aphrodites would be very little wide of the truth. Experience teaches us that memory as well as perception depends upon the state of the brain; and as it is undeniable, that when a man today contemplates an object which he perceived yesterday, or at any former period, he has a view of it in all respects similar to the original perception, only fainter and less distinct, it is extremely probable, that an impression ab extra, which produces a sensation and perception, leaves behind it some tendency in the brain, to vibrate as in the actual sensation, and that this tendency is carried into effect by the internal energy of the mind itself. But in the Peripatetic philosophy, pictures and forms in the senarium were considered as real things, and by no means as metaphorical expressions. This is evident from their being constantly compared to the impression of a seal upon wax, and from their converting the materia prima from something, which can neither be seen nor felt, into visible and tangible body, of which we shall treat afterwards. Now it being certain that on being immaterial, no corporeal form can be impressed, and repeated dispositions having shown that no such forms are in fact impressed on the brain, this whole theory is at once overturned.\n\nModern philosophers having denied that there are real images or forms in the mind during the immediate act of perception, cannot confidently with themselves admit such images in the act of retention, or when those things which were formerly objects of perception are recalled to the mind by the power of memory. Mr Locke's doctrine is, \"that the mind retains these simple ideas which it first received from sensation or reflection, two ways: firstly, by keeping the idea, which is brought into it, for some time actually in view, which is called contemplation; and secondly, by the power which we have to revive again in our minds those ideas, which, after imprinting, have disappeared, or have been, as it were, laid out of sight; as when we conceive heat or light, yellow or sweet, the object being removed. This (he says) is memory; which is, as it were, the storehouse of our ideas.\"\n\nTo explain this more fully, he immediately adds the following observation:\u2014\"But our ideas being nothing but actual perceptions in the mind, which cease to be any thing when there is no perception of them, this laying up of our ideas in the repository of the memory, signifies no more than this, that the mind has a power, in many cases, to revive perceptions which it has once had, with this additional perception annexed to them, that it has had them before. And in this sense it is, that our ideas are said to be in our memories, when indeed they are actually nowhere; but only there is an ability, in the mind, when it will, to revive them again; and, as it were, paint them anew on itself, though some with more some with less difficulty, some more lively and others more obscurely. And thus it is, by the assistance of this retention faculty, that we are said to have all those ideas in our understandings, which, though we do not actually contemplate them, yet we can bring in sight, and make appear again, and be the objects of our thoughts, without the help of those sensible qualities which first imprinted them there.\"\n\nTo attempt a defence of the accuracy of this language would be vain; but as the author's meaning is sufficiently obvious, his expressions may be easily and certainly corrected. Had Locke said\u2014\"But our ideas being nothing but scenes or appearances in the mind, which cease to be any thing when there is no perception of them, this laying up of our ideas in the repository of the memory signifies no more but this, that the mind has a power, in many cases, to revive scenes which it has once viewed, with this additional perception annexed to them, that it has viewed them before;\" there would have been no room for the many petulant remarks which have been made upon the passage.\n\nBut against this account of memory, a much heavier charge has been brought than that which regards the propriety of the language. It has been said, that the additional perception, which, according to Locke, attends the revival of our ideas by the power of memory, \"would be a fallacious perception, if it led us to believe that we had them before, since they cannot have two beginnings of existence: nor can we believe them to have two beginnings of existence; we can only believe that we had formerly ideas or perceptions very like to them, though not identically the same.\" Let us examine this question somewhat narrowly: for if it be really true, that in the sense in which the word fame is here used, we cannot twice contemplate the same idea, all confidence in memory would seem to be at an end.\n\nSuppose a man to stand on some of the rising grounds about Edinburgh, the Caltonhill for instance, and from that eminence to view the glorious prospect of the coast of Fife, the ocean, the frith of Forth, and the little islands scattered in the frith. Let him go away, and return next day to the same place, and look the same way: we would ask whether he has the same view or perception which he had the day before? The man must surely be very captious who would say that he has not; and yet it is certain that the energy of mind by which he perceives on one day cannot be identically the same with that by which he perceived on another; nor are the rays of light which fall upon his eyes on the second day, identically the same with those which fell upon his eyes and occasioned vision on the first day. Let the same man now shut his eyes, and contemplate the various objects at which he had been just looking. They will appear to him in all respects the same as when viewed by means of his organs of sight, only fainter and less distinct, with this additional conviction, that the immediate objects of his present contemplation are not real external things, but ideas or mental representations of those things which had so lately been the objects of his sight. Let him think no more about the matter for some days, and then exert his powers of memory. We have no hesitation to say, that in the sense of the word fame, as used by Mr Locke, the very same ideas will recur.\nRetention resides and be present to his intellect which were present to it at the former contemplation. The second energy of memory or imagination, or whatever it may be called, is not indeed identically the same with the first; nor is that agitation or motion, or whatever other affection of the brain is necessary to memory, identically the same at the second time as at the first: but the mind exerting itself in the very same manner at the one time as at the other, produces the same kind of agitation in the brain, and is itself affected in the very same way at the second as at the first exertion. Whence it follows, that the second ideal scene will be as much the same with the first, as the second actual perception is the same with the first; and the two ideal scenes, and the two actual perceptions, are respectively said to be the same with each other, only because they impress the mind with a conviction that they were occasioned by the same external objects.\n\nBut though we think Locke's doctrine, with respect to memory, may be thus easily vindicated from the charge of fallaciousness, we must acknowledge that to us it appears not to be of much value. It teaches nothing, but that the mind has a power to retain ideas of those objects which it formerly perceived, and in many instances to recall them as occasion may require. But these are truths known to all mankind, to the clown as well as to the philosopher.\n\nPhilosophers in general have paid less regard to the retentive faculties of the mind than to its original powers of perception. Perhaps they imagined, that as memory depends upon perception, and in some respects appears to resemble it, a competent knowledge of the nature of the former faculty would lead to that of the second. Be this as it may, Mr Hume, who was at some pains to detail his notions of perception, has in his Philosophical Essays only dropt concerning memory and imagination a few hints, so loosely thrown together, that, if he had not elsewhere expressed himself with more precision, it would have been difficult to discover his real meaning. According to him, that which is commonly called the perception of an external object, is nothing but a strong impression upon the mind; and that which is called the remembrance of a past object, is nothing but a present impression or idea weaker than the former. Imagination is an idea weaker than the idea or impression which he calls memory. This seems to be a wonderful abuse of language. Impressions are not perceptions; and, if possible, they can still less be called ideas, which are but secondary perceptions. It is likewise far from being true, that an idea of imagination has necessarily less vivacity than an idea of memory. We have seen Mr Hume, and have at the present moment an idea of his form and dress: we can likewise imagine to ourselves a centaur; and though a centaur was never seen, and therefore cannot be an impression repeated by memory, our idea of Retention the monster is much more lively and distinct than that of the philosopher.\n\nDr Reid having observed of memory *, that it is by it we have an immediate knowledge of things past; Reid agrees with perception, but differs from sensation, which has no object but the feeling itself; and that every man can distinguish the thing remembered from the man's remembrance of it\u2014proceeds to inquire what memory is. And, \"First (says he), I think it appears that memory is an original faculty given us by the Author of our being, of which we can give no account but that we are so made. The knowledge (continues he) which I have of things past by my memory, seems to me as unaccountable as an immediate knowledge would be of things to come (v); and I can give no reason why I should have the one and not the other, but that such is the will of my Maker. I find in my mind a distinct conception and a firm belief of a series of past events; but how this is produced I know not. I call it memory; but this is only giving a name to it; it is not an account of its cause. I believe most firmly what I distinctly remember; but I can give no reason of this belief. It is the inspiration of the Almighty which gives me this understanding. When I believe the truth of a mathematical axiom or of a mathematical proposition, I see that it must be so: every man who has the same conception of it sees the same. There is a necessary and an evident connexion between the subject and the predicate of the proposition; and I have all the evidence to support my belief which I can possibly conceive. When I believe that I washed my hands and face this morning, there appears no necessity in the truth of the proposition. It might be or it might not be. A man may distinctly conceive it without believing it at all. How then do I come to believe it? I remember it distinctly. This is all I can say. This remembrance is an act of my mind. Is it impossible that this act should be, if the event had not happened? I confess I do not see any necessary connexion between the one and the other. If any man can show such a necessary connexion, then I think that belief which we have of what we remember will be fairly accounted for: but if this cannot be done, that belief is unaccountable; and we can say no more but that it is the result of our constitution. Our original faculties are all unaccountable: Of these memory is one. He only who made them comprehends fully how they are made, and how they produce in us not only a conception, but a firm belief and assurance, of things which it concerns us to know.\"\n\nOn this account of memory we shall make no remarks. There is a certain sense of the words, in which every thing which the author has said on the subject is undoubtedly\n\n---\n\n* If memory depends upon the state of the brain as it has been affected in past perceptions, this appears to us a strange position. Perhaps the excellent author means nothing more, than that it is as unaccountable to us, that impressions on the brain should cause perception, and the vestiges of those impressions should cause remembrance, as how the mind might not perceive things to come without the intervention of impressions on the brain. If this be his meaning, no man will controvert it: for it is impossible to discover the nature of that relation which subsists between an impression and perception; but that there is such a relation, we know from experience.\nRetention undoubtedly just; and it would be very uncandid to take his words in any other sense. But though memory, as it is the result of that constitution which was given us by God, and not the offspring of habit or human contrivance, is unquestionably an original faculty; and though it is therefore impossible to account for it so fully as to silence every inquiry which may be made, yet we could wish that Dr Reid had bestowed a little more pains upon it, in order to discover if possible in what respects it resembles or differs from perception. He has well observed, that there are laws of nature by which the operations of the mind are regulated, as well as laws of nature which govern the material system. As the latter are the ultimate conclusions which the human faculties can reach in the philosophy of bodies, so the former are the ultimate conclusions which we can reach in the philosophy of minds. The more general that these laws are in both cases, the more useful they are and the more satisfactory: for as they are themselves inexplicable, the fewer they are in number, and the more comprehensive each, the fewer will those phenomena be for which we can give no account. Thus, as we know not what makes the planets tend to the centre of the sun, or heavy bodies tend to the centre of the earth, we can give no other account of these phenomena, but that, as they appear to be of the same kind, it is reasonable to conclude that they proceed from similar causes. What the cause is of this tendency of bodies towards each other, we know not. We call it gravitation, and employ it to account for all phenomena of the same kind. In like manner it is universally allowed, that as we know not how mind and matter operate upon each other, there is something in perception wholly unaccountable. That perception follows sensation; and that there is no sensation which is not occasioned by some affection of the brain, proceeding from some impression ab extra; we have the evidence of experience: but how a particular affection of the brain should excite a sensation in the mind, we know not; though we may here, as in the corporeal system, attribute similar effects to the same or similar causes. Thus, if when we exert an act of memory we have the same appearance of things as in the original act of perception, the rules of philosophizing authorize us to refer both phenomena to the same general law; just as they authorize us to refer the motion of the planets and of projectiles to the same general law. On the other hand, if we perceive no similarity between memory and perception, we have made no progress in the philosophy of mind; for in that case we have discovered two phenomena proceeding from two causes totally different from each other, and both inexplicable. Although we scarcely hope to throw any light upon a subject which Dr Reid has not attempted to illustrate, we shall state a few facts respecting the memory, and submit to the reader the conclusions to which we think these facts lead.\n\n1. Objects once perceived by the senses, when recalled to the mind by the power of memory, appear precisely the same as in the original perception, only the appearance of less distinct*. For example, having seen yesterday a spreading oak growing on the bank of a river, and having heard a shepherd play, and handled a square the power stone, we endeavour to recall to our mind these objects of memory, which are now absent. How is this operation performed? Do we endeavour to form in our minds pictures of them or representative images? or, does our intellect survey the types or forms which, according to Aristotle, those objects left in the imagination when originally perceived? Neither of these things is done. We conceive ourselves as standing in the same place where we stood yesterday; upon which we have perceptions of the objects familiar in all respects to the perceptions which we had when we employed our eyes, our ears, and our hands. The tree appears, as it were, before us; faint indeed, but attended with all the objects which we observed around it yesterday: we seem to hear the sound of the pipe confusedly, and at a distance; to move our hands over the stone, and to feel the same surfaces and the same angles which we felt in the original perception. In this recollection we are not conscious of pictures or images more than in the original survey. The perceptions seem to be of the tree and river themselves, of the sound itself, and of the stone itself, exactly as at the first; and yet we are satisfied that in the act of remembrance we perceive no such object as a real tree, pipe, or stone. That these are facts, every man must be convinced who attends to the energies of his own mind when exerting the powers of retention; and therefore it is, in our opinion, with no impropriety that Mr Harris lays, we may call sense, if we please, a kind of transient imagination; and imagination, on the contrary, a kind of permanent sense; for if these two faculties, as far as the mind or intellect is concerned, be not the same, they seem to resemble each other much.\n\n2. The primary perception of a visible object is more complete, lively, and distinct, and remains longer in the sensorium, than that of any other object. We know likewise by experience, that an idea or secondary perception of a visible object is as much more complete, lively, and distinct, than the idea of any other object, as was the primary perception; and that we remember things which we have seen for a longer time than founds which we have heard, or than tangible objects which we have only handled. Yet there seems to be a constant decay of all our ideas, even of those which are struck (G) deepest and in minds the most retentive; so that if they be not frequently renewed by repeated exercise of the senses, or by reflection on those objects which at first occasioned them, the print (G) wears out,\n\n---\n\n(G) These expressions, which mention ideas as things which are deep struck, and as prints which wear out, are the expressions of Locke. We hope it is needless to warn our readers, that they are used by us, as they were by him, in a metaphorical sense. On these subjects it is impossible to write without metaphor; which, while the meaning is obvious, no man will condemn, who reflects that the words of language were not invented by metaphysicians, and are for the most part literally significant only of sensible objects.\nConcerning ideas, it is easy to remark, that those remain longest and clearest in the memory which are derived from two or more senses, especially if the sense of sight be one of the number, or which are oftenest refreshed by a return of the objects which produced them. Hence a man has a longer and more distinct remembrance of what he has seen than of what he has only heard, of what he has both seen and felt than of what he has only seen; and the ideas which we have of heat and cold, of hunger and thirst, and of all those things which most frequently affect our senses, are extremely clear, and are never quite lost whilst the mind retains any ideas at all.\n\nMemory appears to be a kind of habit, which is not always in exercise with regard to things we remember, but is ready to suggest them when there is occasion. The most perfect degree of this habit is, when the thing presents itself to our remembrance spontaneously, and without labour, as often as there is occasion. A second degree is, when the thing is forgotten for a longer or shorter time, even when there is occasion to remember it, and yet at last some incident, such as a violent passion *, which agitates the whole mind and sensorium, tumbles the idea, as it were, out of its dark corner, and brings it into view without any search. A third degree is, when we cast about and search for what we would remember, and after some labour find it out. This searching faculty of the soul is by Aristotle called *anamnesis*, by Dr Reid and others *reminiscence*, and by Mr Harris *recollection*. Should it be said, that what we will to remember we must already conceive, as we can will nothing of which we have not a conception; and that, therefore, a will to remember a thing, seems to imply that we remember it already\u2014we answer, with Dr Reid, that when we will to remember a thing, we must indeed remember something relating to it; but we may have no positive idea or conception of the thing itself, but only of the relation which it bears to that other thing which we do remember. Thus, one remembers that a friend charged him with a commission to be executed at such a place, but he has forgotten what the commission was. He applies himself to discover it; and recollects that it was given by such a person, upon such an occasion, in consequence of such a conversation: and thus by a train of thought he is led to the very thing which he had forgotten and wished to remember. To this operation it is not always necessary that the relations between the various ideas which the mind turns over be very close, or have their foundation in nature; for a casual connexion is often sufficient. Thus, from seeing a garment, we think of its owner; thence of his habitation; thence of woods; thence of timber; thence of ships; thence of admirals; thence of cannons, iron, furnaces, and forges,\" &c.\n\nThat, in the process of recollection, one idea should suggest another, may be easily accounted for. When, in perception, our minds are exposed to the influence of external objects, all the parts and properties, and even the accidental variable adjuncts of these objects, are perceived by full-grown men at the same time; so that the whole group makes but one impression upon our organs of sense, and consequently upon the mind. By these means all the parts of the simultaneous impression, and consequently of the perception occasioned, are so intimately associated or linked together, that the idea of any one of them recurring at any future period, generally introduces the ideas of all the rest. But as the necessary parts and properties of any thing are more closely linked together, and occur more frequently than any particular variable adjuncts, it is obvious, that by the idea of any one of these properties, the idea of the rest, and of the object itself, will be more readily introduced than by the idea of any variable adjunct. It seems, however, to be certain, that we have no power of calling up any idea at pleasure, but only such as have a connexion, either in nature or by means of former associations, with those that are at any time present to the mind. Thus the sight, or the idea, of any particular person, generally enables us to recollect his name, because his name and his person have been continually associated together. If that fail to introduce the name, we are at a loss and cannot recollect it at all till some other associated circumstance helps us. In naming a number of words in a sentence, or lines in a poem, the end of each preceding word or line being connected with the beginning of the word or line which succeeds it, we can easily repeat them in that order; but we are not able to repeat them backwards with any ease, nor at all till after many fruitless efforts. By frequent trials, however, we acquire at last a facility in doing it, as may be found by making the experiment on the names of number from one to twenty. It is, indeed, probable, that in the wildest flights of fancy, no single idea occurs to us but such as had a connexion with some other idea, perception, or notion, previously existing in the mind, as shall be shown more fully in a subsequent chapter.\n\n4. \"Memory appears to depend entirely or chiefly upon the state of the brain *. For diseases, concussions depend on the brain, spirituous liquors, and some poisons, impair or destroy it; and it generally returns again with the return of health, from the use of proper medicines and methods. It is observable, too, that in recovering from concussions and other disorders of the brain, it is usual for the person to recover the power of remembering the then present common incidents for minutes, hours, and days, by degrees; also the power of recalling the events of his life preceding his illness. At length he recovers this last power perfectly; and at the same time forgets almost all that past in his illness, even those things which at first he remembered for a day or two. Now the reason of this seems to be, that upon a perfect recovery the brain recovers its natural state, and all its former affections and tendencies; but that such affections or tendencies as took place during the preternatural state, i.e., during the patient's illness, are obliterated by the return of the natural state.\" All this we are induced to believe; because, though it is a fact incontrovertible, that in certain diseases the memory is impaired, and recovers its vigour with the return of health, it is not conceivable that the mind itself should suffer any change by diseases, concussions, or spirituous liquors, &c.\n\nFrom these facts we are strongly inclined to conclude,\nRetention clude, that the power of the mind, or immaterial (ii) principle, by which it remembers past events, differs not from that by which it perceives present objects. In perception, impressions are made upon the organs of sense, which are communicated to the brain; and, by some unknown means, occasion sensations which are followed by the perception of the external object. When by the power of memory we recall past objects in the mind, the mind has the same view of them as in the original perception, except that they appear fainter, less distinct, and generally more distant. We have, therefore, reason to conclude, that in the act of remembrance the brain is affected in the same way, though not so forcibly, as in perception. That memory depends as much as perception upon the state of the brain, is confirmed by daily experience; and therefore there cannot be a doubt but that external objects, operating upon the senses, nerves, and brain, leave some permanent effect behind them. What that effect precisely is we cannot know, and we need not desire to know; but that they leave some effect we have as good evidence as that the planets are moved round the sun by forces of the same kind with those by which projectiles are moved on the earth. Could we suppose that they leave real prints or impressions behind them, which we confess to be very little probable, memory would seem to be nothing but the perceptive power of the mind turned to those impressions. If the permanent effect of impressions by external objects be, as Dr Hartley supposes, only a tendency in the brain to vibrate as in the original perception, remembrance will result from the mind's operating upon the brain as in actual perception; and the reason that ideas of memory are fainter than perceptions of sense, is that the former are produced by a single, and the latter by a double, operation.\n\nThis theory appears to be greatly confirmed by the following well-known facts, that children soon commit to their memory any thing which they understand, and as soon forget it; that the powers of memory gradually advance to perfection, and then gradually decay; and that old men remember more distinctly what they perceived in their youth, than what they perceived a year ago. For if the memory belonged wholly to the pure intellect, and had no dependence upon the brain, it is not easy to conceive how it should advance towards a state of perfection and afterwards decay. A being which is unextended and indivisible, can suffer no change either in its essence or in its faculties: the ideas which it had once retained, it would retain for ever. But if memory be occasioned by some relic of sense left in the brain, it is easy to see how all these changes should take place: and therefore, though we have the weight of Dr Reid's authority against us, we cannot help thinking that Aristotle was in the right, when he imputed the shortness of memory in children to this cause, that their brain is too moist and soft to retain impressions made upon it; and that he was likewise in the right, when he imputed the defect of memory in old men to the hardness and rigidity of the brain, which hinders it from receiving any durable impression.\n\nAnother argument to prove, that in remembrance the mind acts upon something left in the brain by the impressions of sense, is this, that nothing can act but where it is present. The truth of this axiom is acknowledged by Dr Reid, and we believe by all mankind except Dr Priestley and one or two others, whose paradoxes we shall consider afterwards. Now it is confessed, that in recollection at least the mind is active; and therefore it must act, not upon an object which has now perhaps no existence, and certainly no immediate existence, but upon something left by that object in the brain or senorium, to which the mind is intimately present.\n\nBut if this be so, we may be asked how it comes by what pains that men never confound memory with perception, nor fancy that they perceive things which they only remember? If perception be an inference drawn from certain sensations excited by an impression on the brain, and if remembrance result from the mind's operating upon relics of those impressions, one would think it natural to suppose, that in both cases we have actual perceptions, though in the one case the perception must be more vivid and distinct than in the other. To this we answer, That previous to all experience, perception and memory are very probably confounded; and that we believe a man brought into the world with all his faculties in their full natural perfection, would not instantly be able to distinguish what he remembered from what he perceived. This we know to be the case with respect to imagination, a faculty which strongly resembles memory; for in dreams, and sometimes even in waking reveries, we fancy that we actually perceive things which it is certain we can only imagine. A very short experience, however, would enable this newly created man to make the proper distinction between remembrance and perception. For let us suppose him to be brought into a dark room, and soon afterwards a candle to be introduced. The candle would give him a visible sensation, though not at first the perception of an external object. Let the candle after some time be carried out: the man would retain a visible idea, which he might confound with the actual sensation. But if, whilst this idea remained in his mind, the candle were brought back, he would instantly feel a difference between the real sensation and the idea, when both were together present to his mind. And having, in some such manner as we have already described, acquired the power of perceiving external objects by means of his senses, he would soon discover, without any effort of his own, the difference between actual perceptions and the ideas treasured up in his memory.\n\n(h) Through the whole of this and the preceding chapters, we have taken it for granted, that the sentient principle in man is not material. This is the common, and, as shall be shown afterwards, the most probable opinion; but whether it be absolutely certain or not, makes no difference on the theories of sensation and perception. These are obviously neither figure nor motion, and therefore not subject to the laws which govern the material world.\nThe only remaining difficulty which seems to encumber this theory of remembrance, is, to account for the order of succession in which objects recur to the memory, and to which we give the name of time.\u2014But this difficulty will vanish when we have ascertained what time is. At present it is sufficient to observe, that our perceptions of external objects remain a certain space of time in the mind; that this time is different, according to the strength and other circumstances of the impression which occasioned the perception; and that traces of those perceptions, i.e. ideas, may be recalled after the intervention of other trains of ideas, and at very different intervals. If one look upon a house, and then shut his eyes, the impression which it made upon his mind will not instantly vanish: he can contemplate the house almost as long as he pleases; and, by the help of various associated circumstances, he may recall the idea several years afterwards, and refer it to the original perception.\n\nBefore we dismiss the subject of retention, it may not be improper to take notice of the retentive powers of inferior animals. Aristotle, Locke, Dr Reid, and almost every philosopher of eminence both among the ancients and moderns, have maintained, that inferior animals have memory as well as men; and indeed we do not perceive how the fact can be denied of the more perfect animals, and those with whose operations we are best acquainted. A dog knows his master again after a long absence; a horse will trace back a road which he has but once travelled, often with more accuracy than his rider; and it is well known that many species of singing birds have a capacity to learn tunes from the human voice, and that they repeat the notes again and again, approaching nearer and nearer to perfection, till at last they sing the tune correctly. These phenomena can be accounted for only by supposing, that in the brains of the several animals traces are left by perception, of the same kind with those which perception leaves in the brain of man, and which are the cause or occasion of his remembrance. With respect to this point, the learned author of Ancient Metaphysics differs from his master Aristotle. He allows that brutes have imagination, but denies that they have memory: for (says he) \"memory necessarily implies a sense of time, and what is felt and felt; but brutes have no idea of time, or of felt and felt; and it is certain that they have not consciousness or reflection, by which only they could review their own operations. At the same time he admits, that imagination in the brute serves the purpose of memory in us; for whenever he sees the object that is painted on his phantasia, he knows it again, but without any perception of the time when he first saw it.\" But that a brute, when he sees the object which is painted on his phantasia, should know it again without referring it to a former perception, is plainly impossible. The recognition of anything consists in a consciousness of its having been perceived before; and nothing more than such recognition is essential to memory. The author's mistake seems to lie in supposing that memory necessarily implies a sense of some determinate portion of past time; but we surely remember many things of which we can only say that we have formerly perceived them, without being able to ascertain the precise period at which we had such perceptions.\n\nA child has the use of memory sooner than he acquires the faculty of speech; but he must have spoken and even reasoned before he can have an accurate notion of time, which, as shall be shown afterwards, arises from comparing the fleeting succession of our own ideas with the permanence of ourselves and other objects. The author's distinction between memory and imagination seems to be on all accounts improper. Aristotle has said, and said truly, that there is memory of ideas as well as of sensible objects; meaning by ideas general conceptions or propositions: but this reviver of his philosophy is inclined to say, \"that memory is only of ideas, consequently belongs only to man; and that imagination is only of sensible objects, and consequently belongs both to man and brute.\"\n\nBut surely man remembers what he has seen and felt as well as what he has conceived or thought; and if imagination and memory be properly distinguished by Mr Harris, the reverse of this writer's doctrine must be true, viz. that imagination belongs only to man, and memory of sensible objects both to man and brute.\n\nWe can contemplate in imagination the idea of a centaur or a golden mountain; but we cannot be said to remember them, for they were never perceived. That a dog can contemplate in his imagination the idea of a centaur or of a golden mountain, we have not the least reason to suppose; but were he not capable of viewing relics of sense reposed with him, and referring them to their original causes, he could not possibly recognize his master after a day's absence.\n\nDr Reid and the same author agree with Aristotle, the power in thinking it probable that brutes have not reminiscence, or the power of recollection; but there are many well-attested facts which seem to prove the contrary. We shall mention one which fell under our own observation. One of the persons concerned in this work was, when a young man, absent for five months from the house of his father. Upon his return, a dog of that species which is commonly called the flebephera cur, and which had been in the possession of his father only a few months before his departure, gazed at him for a few minutes as at any other stranger. The animal then began to walk round him with looks which soon attracted his notice. This made him call the dog by the name which he bore in the family, and stretch out his hand to caress him, when the creature instantly leaped upon him with all that appearance of attachment which these animals so commonly exhibit upon the return of their master after a few days' absence. If this was not recollection, we should be glad to know what it was, for we cannot distinguish it from recollection in men. Indeed, if dogs and some other animals possess, as Aristotle, Locke, and others, allow them to possess, the power of memory, and something of ratiocination; and if, as Dr Reid expressly says*, \"they expect events in the same order and succession in which they happened before;\" it is not conceivable that they can be wholly destitute of reminiscence, or the power of recollection.\n\nThat memory is a faculty of the first importance, Memory cannot be denied; since it is obvious, that, without the power of retaining the ideas and notions which we receive by the senses and other faculties, we never could make any progress in the acquisition of knowledge, but should begin every day, nay every hour, in the same place where we left off the previous day.\nChap. III.\n\nOf Simple Apprehension and Conception.\n\nThe ideas received into the mind by the senses, and treasured up in the memory and imagination, are the original materials of human knowledge. It is by comparing those ideas with one another, or by analyzing them into their first principles, that we acquire all our knowledge in mathematics and philosophy, and indeed all the knowledge which regulates our conduct through life. It must, therefore, be of importance to trace the progress of the mind in her various operations upon these materials; beginning, as she certainly begins, with that which is most simple, and proceeding regularly to those which are more complex and difficult.\n\nNow the first operation of the mind about her ideas appears plainly to be that which logicians term simple apprehension. Having yesterday observed a tree or any other object, if we contemplate the idea of that tree today as it remains in the imagination, without comparing it with any other idea, or referring it to any external object, we perform the operation which is called simple apprehension. We consider simple apprehension as an operation, because the mind in the apprehension of her own ideas is certainly active; she turns them, as it were, round and round, and views them on every side.\n\nSimple apprehension is a phrase which is commonly taken to be of the same import with the word conception; and in the ordinary affairs of life no confusion can arise from an indiscriminate use of the two words: but in this article we think it expedient to employ the phrase simple apprehension, to denote the view or contemplation of those ideas only which the mind by sensation has actually received from external objects; and the word conception to denote the view, not only of those ideas, but also of such as the mind fabricates to herself. Thus, a man may conceive a centaur, but we would not choose to say that he may apprehend a centaur: not that there is any impropriety, perhaps, in this last expression; but as there is certainly a difference between apprehending the idea of what has been seen or felt, and conceiving that which never existed, perspicuity requires that these different operations be expressed by different names.\n\nWe have said that the mind may conceive what never existed: and every man may easily satisfy himself that what we have said is true: but though this has been frequently called the creative power of the mind, it has in fact no resemblance to creation. The materials of all our most complex and fantastic conceptions are furnished to our hands by sensation and reflection; nor can we form one simple idea which was not originally received by some of our senses from external objects, or, as shall be shown afterwards, one intellectual notion, which was not acquired by reflecting on the operations of our own minds. To explain the process of fantastic conception, it is to be observed, that in every sensible object we perceive at once several things, such as colour, figure, extension, and motion. These are the objects of different senses: but they are not, at least by full-grown men, perceived in succession, but all at once; whence it comes to pass that the memory, or the imagination, retains not several distinct and disjointed ideas, but the idea of one coloured, figured, and extended object. But when we compare various objects, or the ideas of various objects, together, we find that in some respects they agree and in others disagree; i.e. that several objects affect some of our senses in the same way, and other senses differently. Thus one globe is black, and another white; one black substance is circular and hard, and another square and soft. In the first instance, the two globes affect our sense of touch in the same way, and our sense of seeing differently; in the second, the two black substances affect our sense of sight in the same way, and our sense of touch differently.\n\nFrom observing this difference among objects by means of the different sensations received from them, the mind learns to analyze its original ideas, which are copies of those sensations, into their first principles, and to combine those principles in such a manner as to form complex ideas of objects which were never actually perceived by the senses. Of the simple and unmixed principles which compose those complex ideas, there is not indeed one which was not originally received by some sense; so that the whole difference between complex ideas fabricated by the mind, and those which are the relics of sensation, consists in the order in which the constituent simple ideas of each are put together. Thus, no man ever saw a mountain of pure gold; and therefore the idea of such a mountain can be in no human mind as a relic of sensation; but we have all seen pieces of gold of different sizes, and we have all seen mountains; and nothing is more easy than to conceive a piece of gold extended on all sides to the size of a mountain, and rising out of the earth. Again, though no person ever saw a centaur, yet it is easy to conceive the upper parts of a man joined to the breast and shoulders of a horse. In these instances, the complex conceptions are of things which it is in the highest degree probable never had a real existence, and which it is certain we never perceived as existing: but the simple ideas of which they are composed are the relics of actual sensations; for every one has perceived as really existing the body of a horse and the upper parts of a man, and when conceiving a centaur he only perceives them to exist united. That we have not in the imagination one simple and unmixed idea which was not left there as a relic of sense, every man will be convinced who shall try to conceive a simple colour or taste which is totally different from all the colours and tastes, and all the shades and varieties of them, which he has received by sensation; but his simple ideas, though all received from without, he may put together in numberless manners, differing from any order in which he has ever actually perceived the qualities of external objects existing.\n\nYet even this power of the mind is limited. It is impossible to put together a number of contrary and incongruous ideas, in such a manner as to form of them one complex conception. No man, for instance, can conceive...\nOf Simple Apprehension and Conception.\n\nConceive a thing to be at once white and black, round and square, hard and soft, in motion and at rest. Hence it is a maxim among philosophers almost universally received, that though we can conceive many things which never actually existed, yet we can form no ideas but of such things as might possibly exist. A centaur never existed, but it may be conceived; for it is by no means impossible that the head of a man might be joined to the body of a horse: but black snow cannot be conceived; for in the complex idea denoted by the word snow whiteness is an essential part, and nothing can be conceived to be both black and white at the same time. From this undoubted fact, that we cannot conceive impossible existence, the power of conception has by some writers in certain instances been made a tell of truth. \"In every idea is implied (says Dr Price) the possibility of the existence of its object; nothing being clearer, than that there can be no idea of an impossibility, or conception of what cannot exist.\" It is an established maxim in metaphysics (says Hume), that whatever the mind conceives, includes the idea of possible existence; or, in other words, that nothing we imagine is absolutely impossible. In a word, it has been admitted by all philosophers, from Pythagoras to Dr Reid, to be an axiom as evident and undeniable as any in Euclid, that whatever we can distinctly conceive is possible, though many things may be possible, nay, may really exist, of which we can form no conception.\n\nThis axiom has been denied by the author of the Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man; who affirms, that \"any two sides of a triangle may be conceived to be equal to the third,\" as distinctly as \"any two sides of a triangle may be conceived to be greater than the third.\" This assertion from such a man surprised us as much as any paradox which we ever read: for nothing is more certain, than that we ourselves can form no conception of a triangle of which two of the sides are only equal to the third. We can, indeed, resolve the proposition into its different parts, and form the distinct and independent ideas of a triangle, two sides, and one side; and we can likewise form the general notion of equality: but to combine these ideas and this notion into one individual complex conception, we find to be absolutely impossible. A man who knows nothing of triangles, if such a man there be, might believe Dr Reid that it is a figure of which one of its sides is equal to the other two; but such a person would have no conception of the figure itself, but only a confidence in the doctor's veracity.\n\nWhat is it to conceive a corporeal thing to exist? Is it not to fancy that we view it on all sides, as what may be seen, or felt, or smelt, or tasted? The doctor, indeed, repeatedly reproaches as the source of much controversy the notion of ideas as images in the mind; and if ideas be taken as real material figures, he is certainly in the right: But we appeal to the common sense of mankind, whether every person who distinctly conceives a triangle, is not at the time conscious that his mind is affected in a manner similar, though not so forcibly, as when he actually views a triangle with his eyes? What other men may feel, they know best; but we are as certain that this is the case with respect to ourselves, as we are certain of our own existence. That this affection of the mind is occasioned by some agitation in the brain, of the same kind with that which occasions actual perception, is highly probable; but whatever be the cause, the fact is undeniable.\n\nThe doctor's words, indeed, taken by themselves, would lead one to think, that by conception he means in this case nothing more than the understanding of the terms of a proposition; but if that be his meaning, there was no room for controversy; as the great philosophers Gudworth, Clarke, Price, and Hume, whose opinion he is combating, would have been as ready as himself to allow, that when a man is thoroughly master of any language, he will find no difficulty in understanding the meaning of any particular words in that language, however absurdly these words may be put together. When Dr Price says, that \"in every idea is implied the possibility of the existence of its object, nothing being clearer than that there can be no idea of impossibility or conception of what cannot exist,\" his meaning evidently is, that we cannot mentally contemplate or fancy ourselves viewing anything corporeal, which we might not actually view with our eyes, or perceive by some other sense (k). This is the true meaning of conception, which is something very different from understanding the separate meaning of each word in a proposition.\n\nThe learned professor, however, appeals to the practice of mathematicians for the truth of his opinion: and if they be on his side, we must give up the cause; for in no science have we such clear ideas, or such absolute certainty, as in mathematical reasonings. But it is to be observed, that the word conception is\n\n(k) Dr Price may be thought by some to have contradicted in this passage what he had asserted in a former. He is a strenuous advocate for abstract and general ideas even of material objects; but those among the moderns who contend the most zealously for these, contend for them only as conceptions of the mind which can have no possible existence out of it. Were this likewise the opinion of Dr Price, he would certainly have fallen into a direct contradiction; but this is not his opinion. His notion of abstract ideas seems to be the same with that of Plato, who considers ideas not only as the possibilities of existence, but as things actually existing from eternity, uncreated and independent even of the Supreme Mind. That Dr Price carries the matter thus far, we are unwilling to believe; but he certainly considers general ideas as real existences independent of our minds, though the immediate objects of our understanding. That in this notion he is mistaken, we shall endeavour to prove in the next chapter. It is enough for our present purpose to have shown that he does not contradict himself; and that he might with great propriety affirm on his own principles, as well as upon the principles of those who admit not of universal ideas, that in every idea is implied the possibility of its object.\nwith no propriety applied to abstract truth, but to real or possible existence; nor can we be said to conceive distinctly a real or possible object, unless we be able to turn it round and round, and view it on all sides.\n\nThe faculties which are conversant about abstract truth are the judgement and the reason; and truth itself consists in the agreement, as falsehood does in the disagreement, of two or more ideas or terms compared together. If those ideas about which the judgement is to be made can be immediately brought together, without the intervention of a third idea, it is impossible that we should judge, or, if Dr Reid will have it so, conceive that to be true which is really false. If the two ideas cannot be immediately brought together, it is impossible that we should form any judgement or conception at all about their agreement or disagreement: but we may suppose or admit, for the sake of argument, that they agree or disagree; and if that supposition conduct to a manifest absurdity, we then know that the supposition was false. It is, therefore, perfectly agreeable to the maxim of Price and Hume, that mathematicians should in many cases prove some things to be possible and others impossible, which without demonstration would not have been believed; because if the ideas compared cannot be immediately brought together, no judgement previous to the demonstration can be formed of the truth or falsehood of the proposition; and if it concern not real or possible existence, it is a proposition with which conception has nothing to do.\n\n\"But (says Dr Reid) it is easy to conceive, that, in the infinite series of numbers and intermediate fractions, some one number, integral or fractional, may bear the same ratio to another as the side of a square bears to its diagonal.\" We are so far from thinking this an easy matter, that if the word conceive be taken in the sense in which it is used by the philosophers whose opinion he is combating, we must confess that we can form no adequate conception at all of an infinite series. When we make the trial, we can only bring ourselves to conceive the real numerical figures 1, 2, 3, &c., or the fractional parts \\( \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\ldots \\); and even here our conception reaches but a small way. We have reason to believe, that minds of a larger grasp can conceive at once more of the series than we can; and that the Supreme Mind conceives the whole of it, if the whole of a mathematical infinity be not a contradiction in terms: but surely no man will say that he can conceive an infinite series as he conceives a centaur, and have an adequate and distinct view of it at once. If, by conceiving that in an infinite series some one number may bear the same ratio to another that the side of a square bears to its diagonal, the doctor only means that such a supposition may be made, his observation is not to the purpose for which it is brought; for the question is not about our power to make suppositions of this kind, but about our power to raise in our imaginations an adequate and distinct mental view of possible or impossible existence. \"To suppose (says Johnson), is to advance by way of argument or illustration, without maintaining the truth of the position.\" In this sense a man may suppose that in an infinite series there may be some one number which bears the same ratio to another that the side of a square bears to its diagonal: but such a supposition contains in it nothing that is positive, which conception always does; it is only admitting, for the sake of argument, of a position, of the truth or falsehood of which the person who makes the supposition knows nothing.\u2014He is only talking of ratios as a blind man may talk of colours. A man born blind may be made to comprehend many of the laws of optics, and may make suppositions about colours, and reason from such suppositions to a certain extent, as clearly and justly as one who sees; but will any person say that a man blind from his birth can conceive red or green? It is much the same with respect to an infinite series. We can follow such a series so far, and may know the ratio by which it increases or decreases, and reason from what we know with the utmost certainty: but no man ever conceived the whole of an infinite series as he conceives an individual object; nor can any reasonings upon the nature of it be applied to the question of conceiving impossible existence.\n\nBut \"mathematicians often require us (says Dr Reid) to conceive things that are impossible, in order to prove them to be so. This is the case in all their demonstrations ad absurdum. Conceive (says Euclid) a right line drawn from one point of the circumference of a circle to another, to fall without the circle. I conceive this, I reason from it, until I come to a consequence that is manifestly absurd, and from thence conclude that the thing which I conceived is impossible.\" If it be indeed true, that Euclid directs his readers to conceive a mathematical circle with a line drawn from one point of its circumference to another, and that line lying without the circle\u2014if he really directs them to form such a complex conception as this, we have no hesitation to affirm, that he requires them to do what is manifestly impossible. The writer of this article has not in his custody any copy of the Elements in the original Greek, and therefore cannot say with certainty what are Euclid's words, nor is it of much importance what they be; for on a question which every man may decide for himself, by looking into his own mind, the authority of Euclid is nothing.\u2014The proposition to which the doctor refers, is the second of the third book; and, in the edition of Simpson, is expressed thus: \"If any two points be taken in the circumference of a circle, the straight line which joins them shall fall within the circle.\" Every mathematician who can form an adequate conception of a circle and a straight line, perceives the truth of this proposition instantly, for it results necessarily from his conception; but he who has not an adequate conception of a circle, may stand in need of a demonstration to show him the truth: for it is to be observed, that demonstration does not make truth; it only points it out to those who cannot perceive it intuitively, just as a microscope does not make the hairs on a mite's back, but only brings them within the field of vision.\n\nWere a man who never examined a mite through a microscope, and who has no adequate ideas of the insect kingdom, to be asked whether there be hairs on a mite's back? he would probably answer that he did not know, but he could conceive no such hairs. In like manner, were a man who has no adequate conception of a mathematical circle, to be asked whether a straight line, which joins any two contiguous points in the circumference, could lie without the circle? he would probably\nbably anfwer that he did not know. Now it is to be remembered, that the reader of the Elements can have no very adequate conception of a circle when he comes to the second proposition of the third book. The definition of a circle was indeed given him in the introduction to the first book; but of that definition he has hitherto had occasion to make very little use, so that his idea of a circle will be little more accurate than that of an illiterate clown, who has no other idea of the figure than what he takes from a halfpenny or a shilling. Dr Reid himself has elsewhere well observed, that \"when a youth of moderate parts begins to study Euclid, every thing at first is new to him. His apprehension is unsteady; his judgement is feeble, and rests partly upon the evidence of the thing, and partly upon the authority of his teacher: but every time he goes over the definitions, the axioms, the elementary propositions, more light breaks in upon him; the language becomes familiar, and conveys clear and steady conceptions.\" In this state he certainly is when he reads for the first time the second proposition of the third book: his conception of a circle can then be neither clear nor steady. Our young geometrician, however, must allow, that the proposition is either true or false; and if he has read the preceding books with any advantage, he must have clear and steady conceptions of angles and triangles, and be able to demonstrate many of their properties. \"Well (says Euclid), though you have no adequate conception of a circle, you are well acquainted with plane angles and triangles, and many of their properties: let us suppose, if that be possible, that my proposition is false, and I will show you that the supposition is absolutely inconsistent with what you know to be demonstrable or self-evident truth.\" This is all which Euclid can be supposed to require, when, in the words of his excellent translator, he says, \"If it (viz. the straight line) do not fall within (the circle), let it fall, if possible, without.\" He could not possibly desire a man who has an adequate idea of a circle, to form the positive and complex conception of that figure, with a straight line touching two points of the circumference, and yet lying on the outside of the circumference; because all his figures and lines are mere conceptions, and not real material things; and such a request would of have been the same thing as if he had said, Conceive what cannot be conceived (1.).\n\nWe have insisted the longer on this point, because we think it of the highest importance: for were it indeed true, that we could conceive impossible existence, the consequences would be very melancholy. These consequences it is needless to enumerate. Our readers will perceive, that if we could put together inconsistent ideas of sensible objects, and view them so united as one consistent whole, nothing is clearer than that our faculties would be contrived to deceive us, and we would be doomed to cheerless and universal scepticism.\n\nCHAP. IV. Of Abstraction and General Ideas.\n\nEvery sensible object is an individual, and differs in many respects from every other object. As such fible object it is perceived by the senses; and ideas being nothing more than relics of sensation preserved in the imagination or memory, every idea must of course be an individual, as much as the object to which it refers. But all science, whether mathematical, moral, or metaphysical, is conversant about general truths; and if truth consist, as we have already observed, and shall more fully evince afterwards, in the agreement or coincidence of ideas, how, it may be asked, can general truth result from the comparison of particular ideas? To get rid of this difficulty, many philosophers, both ancient and modern, pretend that the mind is furnished with general ideas, from a comparison of which result general propositions applicable to many individuals. Philosophers, indeed, have differed in opinion respecting the source of those ideas, some of the ancients deriving them immediately from the Supreme Mind to the human, whilst almost all the moderns say they are framed by abstraction, and therefore call them abstract ideas.\n\nThe doctrine of abstract ideas has been so fairly stated, and, in our opinion, so completely overturned, by Bishop Berkeley, that we shall content ourselves with abridging what he has said on the subject, and obviating\n\n(1) Principal Campbell, treating of the commonly received doctrine of abstraction, and having shown, that though Locke has in one passage of his immortal work expressed himself on the subject in terms unintelligible, his sentiments on the whole differed little from those of Berkeley and Hume, adds, \"Some of the greatest admirers of that eminent philosopher seem to have overlooked entirely the preceding account of his sentiments on this subject; and, through I know not what passion for the paradoxical (I should rather say the impossible and unintelligible), have shown an amazing zeal for defending the propriety of the hasty expressions which appear in the passages formerly referred to. Has not the mind of man (say they) an unlimited power in moulding and combining its ideas? The mind, it must be owned, hath an unlimited power in moulding and combining its ideas. It often produces wonderful forms of its own out of the materials originally supplied by sense; forms indeed of which there is no exemplar to be found in nature:\u2014centaurs and griffins,\n\nGorgons and hydras, and chimeras dire.\n\nBut still it must not attempt absolute impossibilities, by giving to its creature contradictory qualities. It must not attempt to conceive the same thing to be black and white at the same time; to be no more than three inches long, and yet not less than three thousand; to conceive two or more lines to be both equal and unequal; the same angle to be at once acute, obtuse, and right;\" or, we may add, the two sides of a triangle to be not greater than the third. See Philosophy of Rhetoric, vol. ii. p. 108, &c.\nOf Abstraction obviating some cavils which have lately been urged against his reasoning. \"It is agreed on all hands (says that learned and ingenious prelate), that the qualities or modes of things do never really exist each of them apart by itself and separated from all others; but are mixed, as it were, and blended together, several in the same object. But, we are told, the mind being able to consider each quality singly, or abstracted from those other qualities with which it is united, does by that means frame to itself abstract ideas. For example: There is perceived by sight an object extended, coloured, and moved: this mixed or compound idea, the mind resolving into its simple constituent parts, and viewing each by itself exclusive of the rest, does frame the abstract ideas of extension, colour, and motion. Not that it is possible for colour or motion to exist without extension; but only that the mind can frame to itself by abstraction the idea of colour exclusive of extension, and of motion exclusive of both colour and extension.\n\nAgain, The mind having observed, that in the particular extensions perceived by sense, there is something common and alike in all, and some other things peculiar, as this or that figure or magnitude, which distinguish them from one another; it considers apart, or singles out by itself, that which is common, making thereof a most abstract idea of extension, which is neither line, surface, nor solid, nor any figure or magnitude, but is an idea entirely prefounded from all these. So likewise the mind, by leaving out of the particular colours perceived by sense that which distinguishes them one from another, and retaining that only which is common to all, makes an idea of colour in abstract, which is neither red, nor blue, nor white, nor any other determinate colour. And as the mind frames to itself abstract ideas of qualities or modes, so does it by the same precision or mental separation attain abstract ideas of the more compounded beings, which include several coexistent qualities. For example: The mind having observed that Peter, James, and John, resemble each other in certain common agreements of shape and other qualities, leaves out of the complex or compounded idea it has of Peter, James, and any other particular man, that which is peculiar to each, retaining only what is common to all, and so makes an abstract idea wherein all the particulars equally partake, abstracting entirely from and cutting off all those circumstances and differences which might determine it to any particular existence. After this manner, it is said, we come by the abstract idea of man, or, if you please, humanity or human nature, in which, it is true, there is included colour, because there is no man but has some colour; but then it can be neither black, nor white, nor any particular colour, because there is no one particular colour wherein all men partake. So likewise there is included stature; but then it is neither tall stature, nor low stature, nor middle stature, but something abstracted from all these; and so of the rest. Moreover, there being a great variety of other creatures that partake in some parts, but not all, of the complex idea of man; the mind, leaving out those parts which are peculiar to man, and retaining those only which are common to all the living creatures, frameth the idea of animal; which abstracts not only from all particular men, but also from all birds, beasts, fishes, and insects. The constituent parts of that abstract idea of animal, are body, life, sense, and spontaneous motion. By body, is meant body without any particular shape or figure, there being no one shape or figure common to all animals, without covering either hair or feathers or scales, &c. and yet not naked; hair, feathers, scales, and nakedness, being the distinguishing properties of particular animals, and for that reason left out of the abstract idea. Upon the same account, the spontaneous motion must be neither walking, nor flying, nor creeping: it is nevertheless motion; but what that motion is, it is not easy to conceive.\n\n\"Whether others have this wonderful faculty of controverting their ideas (continues the bishop); they best ed; and can tell; for myself, I find indeed that I have a faculty of imagining or representing to myself the ideas of those particular things which I have perceived, and of variously compounding and dividing them. I can imagine a man with two heads, or the upper parts of a man joined to the body of a horse. I can consider the hand, the eye, the nose, each by itself abstracted or separated from the rest of the body. But then, whatever hand or eye I imagine, it must have some particular shape, and some particular colour.\u2014Likewise the idea of man that I frame to myself, must be either of a white, or a black, or a tawny, a straight or a crooked, a tall or a low, or a middle-sized man. I cannot by any effort of thought conceive the abstract idea above described. To be plain, I own myself able to abstract in one sense, as when I consider some particular parts or qualities separated from others with which, though they are united in some objects, yet it is possible they may really exist without them. But I deny that I can abstract one from another, or conceive separately those qualities which it is impossible should exist so separated; or that I can frame a general notion by abstracting from particulars in the manner aforesaid; and there are grounds to think most men will acknowledge themselves to be in my case.\"\n\nTo think this, there are indeed such good grounds, known to that it is probable some of our readers, little conversant with the writings of modern metaphysicians, are by this time disposed to suspect, that the bishop in his zeal may have misrepresented the doctrine of abstraction; as no man in his senses, who is not perverted by some darling hypothesis, can suppose himself capable of tagging together such monstrous inconsistencies, as magnitude which is neither large nor small, and colour which is neither white, red, green, nor black, &c. But that the ingenious prelate, in his account of this process of lopping and pruning, as Mr Harris contemptuously, but most properly, terms it, has not exaggerated in the smallest degree, is apparent from the following account of abstraction given by Mr Locke. \"Abstract ideas (says that writer) are not so obvious or easy to children, or the yet unexercised mind, as particular ones. If they seem so to grown men, it is only because by constant and familiar use they are made so: for when we nicely reflect upon them, we shall find that general ideas are fictions and contrivances of the mind that carry difficulty with them, and do not so easily offer themselves as we are apt to imagine. For example, does it not require some pains and skill to form the general idea of a triangle...\"\nOf Abstraction (which is yet none of the most abstract, comprehensive, and difficult) for it must be neither oblique nor rectangle, neither equilateral, equicrural, nor facemon, but all and none of these at once. In effect, it is something imperfect that cannot exist, an idea wherein some parts of several different and inconsequent ideas are put together.\" \"Surely (to use the words of Principal Campbell*) the bare mention of this hypothesis is equivalent to a confutation of it, since it really confutes itself.\" But if any man has the faculty of framing in his mind such an idea of a triangle as is here described, it would be vain in us to dispute with him; for we are possessed of no such faculty, and therefore would fight on unequal terms. All we have to desire is, that the reader would fully and certainly inform himself whether he has such an idea or not; and this can be no hard task to perform. What is more easy for any one than to look a little into his own thoughts, and there try whether he has, or can attain to have, an idea of colour separated from all extension; of extension, which is neither great nor small; of taste, which is neither sweet nor bitter, nor acid, nor agreeable, nor disagreeable; or the general idea of a triangle, which is neither oblique nor rectangle, equicrural, equilateral, nor facemon, but all and none of these at once (m)?\n\nDr Reid having denied that there are or can be conceptions in the mind any ideas of sensible objects, rejects of course the doctrine of abstract general ideas, whilst he maintains in fact the same thing, only substituting the word conception for the word idea. \"What hinders me (says he) from attending to the whiteness of the paper before me, without applying that colour to any other object?\" We know nothing indeed which can hinder any man from performing this operation, which is daily and hourly performed by infants; but will the doctor say, that he can attend to colour, or conceive it, abstracted from the paper and every other surface? We are persuaded he will not, though he immediately adds, \"the whiteness of this individual object is an abstract conception.\" Now we should rather have thought, that, consistent with his own notions of colour, he would have called the whiteness of the paper a concrete quality, and his own conception of it a particular and concrete conception. If he conceives the whiteness as separated from the paper, it is no longer the whiteness of that individual object; and he must either conceive it as abstracted from all objects, which is plainly impossible; or he must conceive it as inhering in some other object; and then neither the quality of whiteness, nor his conception of it, is abstract in general, but concrete and particular. He affirms, however, \"that in abstraction, strictly so called, he can perceive nothing that is difficult either to be understood or practised.\" This is going much farther into the doctrine than Mr Locke went; for he owned that there was much difficulty in it. Let us see how it becomes so easy to Dr Reid. \"What can be more easy (says he) than to distinguish the different attributes which we know to belong to a subject? In a man, for instance, to distinguish his size, his complexion, his age, his fortune, his birth, his profession, and twenty other things that belong to him.\" All this indeed, and much more, we can do with the utmost ease; but this is not abstraction, strictly so called, nor anything like abstraction. We distinguish the size, the complexion, the age, &c., of the man, from one another; but still we conceive them all as his qualities; nor is it possible, at least for us, to abstract them from him, without conceiving them as the qualities of some other man; so that our conceptions are all concrete and particular. \"It ought likewise to be observed (says the Professor), that attributes may with perfect ease be distinguished and disjoined in our conception, which cannot be actually separated in the subject.\" They may be so in his conception, but certainly not in ours; for we can conceive nothing which may not actually exist. \"Thus (continues he) I can in a body distinguish its solidity from its extension, and its weight from both. In extension, I can distinguish length, breadth, and thickness; yet none of these can be separated from the body, or from one another. It is therefore certain, that attributes, which in their nature are absolutely inseparable from their subject and from one another, may be disjoined in our conception; one cannot exist without the other, but one can be conceived without the other.\" So far is this from being a matter of certainty, that in every possible sense in which we can understand the word conception, it appears to us as evidently false, as that three and two are equal to nine. It is indeed not difficult to distinguish in a body its solidity from its extension, and its weight from both; but can we distinguish them out of the body? or, to speak in plain language, can we conceive solidity as separated from all extension and all weight? Unless this can be done, and by us it cannot be done, there is no abstraction strictly so called. It is indeed easy to conceive solidity or extension abstracted from any one individual object; but how is it done? Why, by transferring your attention to some other individual object. Thus, we can easily conceive solidity or extension separated from a guinea, for instance; but it is only by transferring our thoughts to another body, a piece of silver, or a ball of lead, &c., and our conceptions in both cases are particular and concrete.\n\nAs we think this opinion of Dr Reid's respecting abstraction both ill-founded and of dangerous consequences, we have expressed our dissent from it in strong terms; and in doing so we have only followed the example set us by himself when differing from the theories of Hume and Berkeley. But we are so thoroughly\n\n(m) \"If such an extraordinary faculty (abstraction) were possible, I cannot for my part conceive what purpose it could serve. An idea hath been defined by some logicians, the form or resemblance of a thing in the mind; and the whole of its power and use in thinking is supposed to arise from an exact conformity to its archetype. What then is the use or power of that idea, to which there neither is nor can be any archetype in nature, which is merely a creature of the brain, a moniter that bears not the likeness of any in the universe?\" Philosophy of Rhetoric, vol. ii. p. 110.\nOf Abstraction\u2014roughly convinced that the doctor's acuteness is superior to our own (x), that we are not without our fears that we may have mistaken his meaning. We are conscious that we have not wilfully misrepresented it; and to enable our readers to judge for themselves between him and us, we shall lay before them his definition of general conceptions in his own words.\n\nThat there are in every language general terms, is known to all mankind; for such are all substantives, proper names excepted; and all adjectives. But \"it is impossible (says the doctor)\" that words can have a general signification, unless there be conceptions in the mind of the speaker and of the hearer, of things (x) that are general. It is to such that I give the name of general conceptions: and it ought to be observed, that they take this denomination, not from the act of the mind in conceiving, which is an individual act; but from the object or thing conceived, which is general.\"\n\nNow, whatever is conceived, must be either external to the mind, or present with it. But the doctor himself acknowledges, \"That all the objects we perceive are individuals. Every object of sense, of memory, or of consciousness, is an individual object. All the good things we enjoy or desire, and all the evils we feel or fear, must come from individuals; and I think I may venture to say, that every creature which God has made in the heavens above, or in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth, is an individual.\" If this be so, and no man can call it in question, it is obvious that we can have no general conception of any thing external. The act of conceiving is an individual act; and therefore the only thing which can be general, must be something present with the mind, and different from the mere act of conceiving: But what can this be, if not what Berkeley and others call an idea? and how can we have an idea of which we are not conscious? yet everything of which we are conscious Dr Reid himself acknowledges to be an individual.\n\nBut if the doctrine generally received respecting abstract ideas be so very absurd as it has appeared in our representation, how comes it to be so prevalent among the acute philosophers? To this we answer, that those philosophers have certainly in this instance been imposed upon by the structure of language. Every adjective and every substantive, proper names excepted, are words of general signification; and all science is conversant about general truth; but as words are said to be significant, not of things, but of ideas; and as truth results from the agreement or coincidence of ideas; it has been hastily supposed, that without general ideas there could have been neither general terms nor general truth. This is plausible, but it is not solid. Every object which affects our senses is an individual object; but we perceive that two or more objects which affect some of our senses very differently, affect others of them in precisely the same way. Thus, the paper upon which one writes, the snow which he perceives from his window, and the milk which he may use at breakfast, affect his senses of touch and taste very differently, but they present the same appearances to his eye. This diversity in the one case he believes to proceed from different powers or qualities in the several objects; and the sameness of appearance in the other, from similar qualities in these objects. To the similar qualities, though he can frame no idea of them abstracted from every individual object, he gives one common name; and calls every object which presents the same appearance to his eye that snow does, a white object; where the word white does not stand for an abstract idea, but for a quality inherent in one or more objects. Hence the origin of adjectives in language, which denote more than can be expressed by any class of substantives; for every adjective, besides the power of a name, includes in itself the force of a conjunction. See Grammar.\n\nThe other class of general terms comprehends substantives; of which the origin is as follows: The objects about which we have occasion to speak or write are so numerous and so fluctuating, that if every individual had a proper name, a complete language could never be formed. But as there are not perhaps in nature two objects that appear to us similar in all respects, so are there not in nature two objects which affect all our senses differently. The mind, therefore, either actually perceiving two or more objects at once, or contemplating the ideas left by two or more objects in the memory, perceives, by its intellective power, in what respects they agree and in what they disagree. If the agreement be striking, and in more qualities than one, it combines the several individuals into one class or species, giving to the whole a common name, which equally denotes the species and every individual belonging to it. Thus, observing that Peter, James, and John, agree in having the same erect form, in walking on two legs, in having hands, &c. and in being endowed with reason, we combine these three, and all other individuals which we perceive to agree in the same striking and important qualities, into one species, to which we give the name of man\u2014a word which equally denotes the whole species and every individual of it. Again, Contemplating several figures, which all agree in the circumstance of being bounded by three straight lines meeting one another so as to form three angles, we call the whole class of figures and each individual by the name of triangle\u2014though it may be impossible to contemplate any number of triangles without perceiving that all the angles of one are acute; that one angle of another is a right angle; and that in the third there is one angle obtuse; but the word triangle, unless it is limited in its signification by the addition of an adjective, is equally expressive of an acute-angled triangle, a right-angled triangle, and an obtuse-angled triangle. By thus arranging individuals according to their most conspicuous qualities, we may combine all the objects existing into so many classes or species, which shall be afterwards known by as many names; but of each species we neither have, nor can have,\n\n(x) Notwithstanding this declaration, which is made with the greatest sincerity, we do not apprehend that we are guilty of presumption when we examine the doctor's opinions. Berkeley and Hume were certainly as acute as any metaphysician who has succeeded them; yet their opinions have been canvassed without ceremony, and to much advantage. Aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus.\n\n(x) He tells us soon afterwards, that there are no things general. How is the one passage to be reconciled with the other?\nOf Abstraction have any other idea than that of a multitude of similar individuals.\n\nAs our acquaintance with nature enlarges, we discover resemblances, striking and important between one species and another, which naturally begets the notion of a higher class called a genus. From comparing man with beasts, birds, fishes, and reptiles, we perceive that they are all alike possessed of life, or a principle of sensation and action, and of an organized body; hence we rank them all under a higher class or genus, to which we give the name of animal; which equally denotes the whole genus, each species comprehended under the genus, and every individual of every species. Thus, animal, is a genus; man, beast, bird, are so many species comprehended under that genus; and Peter, James, and John, are individuals of the species man. Peter, James, and John, are proper names, denoting each an individual; man, beast, bird, are specific terms, denoting each a whole species comprising many individuals; and animal is a general term, because it denotes a whole genus, comprehending under it several species, of which each consists of many individuals; and the general term denotes either the whole genus, all the species, or any individual of all the species. This is the whole mystery of abstraction: they are merely terms, that in strictness of speech are general and abstract; and even those are general only as signs, of which the full signification cannot always be represented by any conceivable idea.\n\nIt is a received opinion (says Bishop Berkeley), that language has no other end but the communicating of our ideas, and that every significant name stands for an idea. This being so; and it being without certain, that names, which yet are not thought altogether insignificant, do not always mark out particular conceivable ideas; it is straightway concluded that they stand for abstract notions. That there are many names in use amongst speculative men, which do not always suggest to others determinate particular ideas, is what nobody will deny; and a little attention will discover, that it is not necessary, even in the strictest reasonings, that significant names, which stand for ideas, should every time they are used excite in the understanding the ideas they are made to stand for. In reading and discoursing, names are for the most part used as letters in algebra; in which, though a particular quantity be marked by each letter, yet to proceed right, it is not requisite that in every step each letter suggest to our thoughts that particular quantity it was appointed to stand for.\" The same thing is true of ideas, which as well as names are often used merely as signs representing a whole class; and on that account they may be called general, though every idea is in itself strictly particular. Thus, \"An idea, which considered in itself is particular, becomes general by being made to represent or stand for all other particular ideas of the same sort. To make this plain by an example, suppose a geometrician is demonstrating the method of cutting a line in two equal parts: He draws, for instance, a black line of an inch in length: this, which in itself is a particular line, is nevertheless, with regard to its signification, general; since, as it is there used, it represents all particular lines whatsoever: so that what is demonstrated of it is demonstrated of all lines, or, in other words, of a line in general. And as that particular line becomes general by being made a sign, so the name line, and the idea of a line in the imagination, Of Abstraction and general Ideas.\n\neither of which taken absolutely is particular, by being signs are made general likewise. And as the former owes its generality, not to its being the sign of an abstract or general line, but of all particular right lines that may possibly exist; so the latter, the name and the idea, must be thought to derive their generality from the same cause, namely, the various particular lines which each of them indifferently denotes.\" Again, When one demonstrates any proposition concerning triangles, it is to be supposed that he has in view to demonstrate an universal truth; yet the particular triangle which he considers must be either equilateral, isosceles, or scalene; for a plain triangle, which is none of these, can neither exist nor be conceived. But whether it be of this or that sort is of no importance, as any of them may equally stand for and represent all rectilineal triangles, and on that account be denominated \"universal.\"\n\nThis doctrine reflecting names and ideas being used merely as signs, has been adopted by almost every subsequent philosopher; and by Principal Campbell it has been illustrated with perspicuity and acuteness, every way worthy of the author of the Dissertation on Miracles. \"In confirmation of this doctrine (says he*), it may be observed, that we really think by Philosophy, as well as speak by them. All the truths which phy of Rhetoric constitute science, which give exercise to reason, and teric. are discovered by philosophy, are general; all our ideas, in the strictest sense of the word, are particular. All the particular truths about which we are conversant are properly historical, and compose the furniture of memory. Nor do I include under the term historical the truths which belong to natural history; for even these too are general. Now, beyond particular truth or historical facts, first perceived and then remembered, we should never be able to proceed one single step in thinking any more than in conversing, without the use of signs.\n\nWhen it is affirmed that the whole is equal to all its parts, there cannot be an affirmation which is more perfectly intelligible, or which commands a fuller assent. If, in order to comprehend this, I recur to ideas, all that I can do is to form a notion of some individual whole, divided into a certain number of parts of which it is constituted; suppose of the year, divided into the four seasons. Now all that I can be said to discern here is the relation of equality between this particular whole and its component parts. If I recur to another example, I only perceive another particular truth. The same holds of a third and of a fourth. But so far am I, after the perception of ten thousand particular similar instances, from the discovery of the universal truth, that if the mind had not the power of considering things as signs, or particular ideas as representing an infinity of others, resembling in one circumstance though totally dissimilar in every other, I could not so much as conceive the meaning of an universal truth. Hence it is that some ideas, to adopt the expression of Berkeley, are particular in their nature, though particular in themselves, but general in their representation.\"\n\nBut if in universal propositions, ideas particular in themselves be used only as the signs of others, it may manifestly be demanded, how we can know any proposition to be general true of all the ideas which are represented by the truths; be sign; cause\nFor example, having demonstrated that the three angles of an isosceles rectangular triangle are equal to two right ones, how can we conclude that this affection therefore agrees to all other triangles which have neither a right angle nor two equal sides?\n\nTo this question Bishop Berkeley and Principal Campbell give the following answer: Though the idea we have in view whilst we make the demonstration be that of an isosceles rectangular triangle, whose sides are of a determinate length, we may yet be certain that the demonstration extends to all other rectilineal triangles of what sort or bigness soever; for this plain reason, that neither the equality nor determinate length of the sides, nor the right angle, are at all concerned in the demonstration. It is true, the idea or diagram we have in view includes all these particulars; but then there is not the least mention made of them in the proof of the proposition. It is not said the three angles are equal to two right angles, because one of them is a right angle, or because the sides comprehending it are of equal length; which sufficiently shows that the right angle might have been oblique and the sides unequal; and for all that the demonstration have held good. In every one of Euclid's theorems, a particular triangle, and a particular parallelogram, and a particular circle, are employed as signs to denote all triangles, all parallelograms, and all circles. When a geometrician makes a diagram with chalk upon a board, and from it demonstrates the property of a straight-lined figure, no spectator ever imagines that he is demonstrating a property of nothing else but that individual white figure, five inches long, which is before him.\u2014Every one is satisfied that he is demonstrating a property of all of that order, whether more or less extensive, of which it is both an example and a sign; all the order being understood to agree with it in certain characters, however different in other respects.\n\nNay, what is more, the mind with the utmost facility extends or contracts the representative power of the sign as the particular occasion requires. Thus the same equilateral triangle will with equal propriety serve for the demonstration, not only of a property of all equilateral triangles, but of a property of all isosceles triangles, or even of a property of all triangles whatever. Nay, so perfectly is this matter understood, that if the demonstrator in any part should recur to some property belonging to the particular figure he hath constructed, but not essential to the kind mentioned in the proposition, and which the particular figure is solely intended to represent, every intelligent observer would instantly detect the fallacy: So entirely for all the purposes of science doth a particular serve for a whole species or genus. Now, why one visible individual should in our reasonings serve without the smallest inconvenience as a sign for an infinite number, and yet one conceivable individual, or a particular idea of imagination, should not be adapted to answer the same end, it will, we imagine, be utterly impossible to say (n).\n\nIt must, however, be confessed, that there is a considerable difference in kind, between ideas used as signs and the general terms of any language. Amongst all the individuals of a species, or even of the highest genus, there is still a natural connexion, as they agree in the specific or generic character; and when the mind makes use of any positive idea as the sign of the species or genus, that idea appears in the imagination as an exact resemblance of some one individual. But the connexion which subsists between words and things, or even between words and ideas, is in its origin arbitrary; and yet its effect upon the mind is much the same with that of the natural connexion between ideas and things. For having often had occasion to observe particular words used as signs of particular things, and specific terms used as signs of a whole species, we contract a habit of associating the sign with the thing signified, insomuch that either being presented to the mind necessarily introduces or occasions the apprehension of the other. Custom in this instance operates precisely in the same manner as natural resemblance in the other; so that certain sounds, and the ideas of things to which they are not naturally related, come to be as thoroughly linked in our conceptions as the ideas of things and things themselves. Nay, so completely are they linked together, that we often use, through long chains of reasoning, certain sounds or words, without attending at all to the ideas or notions of which they are signs. \u201cI believe\u201d (says the author of A Treatise on Human Nature), that every one who examines the situation of his mind in reasoning will agree with me, that we do not annex distinct and complete ideas to every term we make use of; and that in talking of government, church, negotiation, conquest, we seldom spread out in our minds all the simple ideas of which the compound notions signified by these terms are composed. It is, however, observable, that notwithstanding this imperfection, we may avoid talking nonsense on these subjects, and may perceive any repugnance among the ideas as well as if we had a full comprehension of them.\u201d This remark generally holds true; but then it is to be observed, that all the words used as signs, and which yet do not denote any one conceivable determinate idea, must be capable of definition. Thus, in matters that are perfectly familiar, in simple narration, or in moral observations on the occurrences of life, a man of common understanding may be deceived by specious falsehood, but is hardly to be gulled by downright nonsense or a repugnance.\n\n(n) Were it possible to frame an abstract general idea of a triangle, which is neither equilateral, isosceles, nor scalene, even that idea must be used merely as a sign as much as any particular triangle whatever; and the question might still be asked, How we can know any proposition to be true of all the triangles represented by the sign? For example: having demonstrated that the three angles of an ideal triangle, which is neither equilateral, isosceles, nor scalene, are equal to two right angles, how can we conclude that this affection agrees to triangles which are equilateral, &c.? To this question it is not easy to conceive what answer could be given other than that of Berkeley and Campbell, in the case of using particular and conceivable triangles as signs.\nof abstraction and general ideas.\n\nAlmost all the possible applications of the terms (in other words, all the acquired relations of the signs) have become customary to him. The consequence is, that an unusual application of any of them is instantly detected; this detection breeds doubt, and this doubt occasions an immediate recourse to definition; which, proceeding through species and genera, resolves complex terms into others less complex, till it ends at last in simple ideas and relations, which can neither be defined nor misinterpreted (o). See Logic.\n\nThus then we see, that though there are no ideas, properly speaking, general and abstract, a man may, by terms and particular ideas, used as signs, arrive at the knowledge of general truth. In neither case is it the matter, if we may be allowed the expression, but the power of the sign that is regarded by the mind. We find, that even in demonstrative reasonings, signs the most arbitrary, or mere symbols, may be used with as little danger of error as ideas or natural signs. The operations both of the algebraic and arithmetician are strictly of the nature of demonstration. The one employs as signs the letters of the alphabet, the other certain numerical characters. In neither of these arts is it necessary to form ideas of the quantities and sums signified; in some instances it is even impossible without resolving the quantity or sum into parts, in a manner analogous to definition; and then the mind comprehends not the whole quantity or number at once, but the several parts of which it is composed, which it connects (p) by the relation of junction or addition. Yet without this resolution, the equations and calculations carried on by means of the letters and figures significant of the whole quantity or the whole sum, are not the less accurate or convincing. And so much for abstraction, generalization, and the power of signs, whether natural or artificial.\n\nChap. V. Of the Association of Ideas.\n\nEvery man whilst awake is conscious of a continued train of thought spontaneously arising in his mind and passing through it; nor could a single new or infant be pitched upon in which some idea is not present in his memory or imagination. No one idea, however, unless detained by a voluntary exertion of the mind, or unless productive of intense pleasure or pain, remains long in the imagination; but each hastes off the stage to make way for another, which takes its turn and is succeeded by a third, &c. We are not to imagine that this train of thought is altogether fortuitous and incoherent. \"It is evident (says Mr Hume *), that there is a principle of connexion between different thoughts or ideas of the mind; and that, in their appearance to the memory or imagination, they introduce each other with a certain degree of method and regularity. In our more serious thinking or discourse this is so observable, that any particular thought which breaks in upon the regular track or chain of ideas is immediately remarked and rejected. Even in our wildest and most wandering reveries, nay, in our very dreams, we shall find, if we reflect, that the imagination ran not altogether at adventures, but that there was still a connexion upheld among the different ideas which succeeded each other. Were the loosest and freest conversation to be transcribed, there would immediately be observed something which connected it in all its transitions: Or, where this is wanting, the person who broke the thread of discourse might still inform you, that there had secretly revolved in his mind a succession of thoughts, which had gradually led him from the subject of conversation. Among different languages, even where we cannot suspect the least connexion or communication, it is found, that words expressive of ideas the most compounded, do yet nearly correspond to each other; a certain proof that the simple ideas comprehended in the compound ones, were bound together by some universal principle, which had an equal influence on all mankind.\"\n\nThat these observations are well founded, every man may be satisfied by looking attentively into his own thoughts; but when the author reduces the principles of this association of ideas to three, viz. resemblance, contiguity in time and place, and cause or effect, he certainly contracts them within too narrow a compass. That these principles often serve to connect ideas, will not indeed be denied. A picture leads our thoughts to the original: the mention of one apartment in a building introduces an inquiry or discourse concerning the others: and if we think of a wound, we can hardly forbear reflecting on the pain which follows it. But surely ideas sometimes succeed each other without resemblance, without contiguity in time or in place, and without being connected by the relation of a cause to its effect. Besides all this, there are other associations than of ideas. Ideas are associated with passions and emotions, and passions and emotions are associated together. A particular idea is associated with a proper name, and often with the general name of the species. General conceptions, such as those which Mr Locke calls mixed modes (see Mode), are associated with signs both audible and visible, and signs are associated with each other. Surely virtue, as it conflicts in action and intention, does not resemble the found virtue, is not contiguous to it in time or in place, and is neither its cause nor its effect; nor is it conceivable, that the arbitrary signs of different things should have any natural relation to one another.\n\nBut were the enumeration complete, the bare mention of these principles does not account for the phenomena:\n\n(o) For a farther view of this subject, see some excellent observations on the common doctrine concerning abstraction by Professor Dugald Stewart of Edinburgh. Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind.\n\n(r) No man, we think, will pretend that he can perceive at one view a million of individual men, or that he can imagine or conceive at once a million of ideal men: yet he may divide the million into parts, which, in the one case may be easily viewed, and in the other may be easily conceived, in succession. Thus, $100 + 100 + 100$, &c.\nChap. V.\n\nAssociation pomena: For, granting the fact, it may still be asked, Why does a picture lead our thoughts to the original; or the mention of one apartment in a building introduce an inquiry concerning the others? To these questions our author has given no answer; nor are we acquainted with any writer who can be said to have attempted it, except Dr Hartley and his ingenious editor. There may be some of our readers whom the names of these men will prejudice against their theory; but, doubtless, the greater part are willing to adopt truth, or to examine an ingenious speculation, from whatever quarter it comes. To such as feel themselves otherwise disposed, we beg leave to say, that if they allow the name of Priestley to disqualify them at what follows, they will furnish him with a new proof of the truth of the doctrine which they reject.\n\nThat ideas should be associated together, seems to be inevitable from the manner in which the mind acquires them. All our ideas, properly speaking, are of sensible objects, and by far the greater part of them of visible objects. But every sensible object conveys at once various sensations and perceptions to the mind, which appear not only united in fact, but inseparable in imagination. Thus, when a man looks at any particular object, a tree for instance, he perceives the trunk, branches, leaves, size, shape, and colour, &c. of the whole at once: he does not first perceive the figure of the trunk, then its size, then its colour, then the branches, &c. all in succession; but a perception of the whole is conveyed to the mind by one simultaneous impression (Q). We have already seen, that the senses, in fact, convey nothing to the mind but their respective sensations; and that the perception of the external object instantly follows the sensation. We have likewise seen, that sensation is occasioned by some impression, concussion, or vibration, given to the nerves and brain, and by them communicated to the mind or percipient being. We have likewise seen, that memory depends as much upon the brain as original sensation, and is always attended or occasioned by similar concussions or vibrations, &c. These are facts proved by universal experience, and which, we believe, no thinking man has ever called in question.\n\nIt follows, therefore, that every actual sensation must leave some effect in the brain, either an actual print, which seems to be impossible, or a tendency to vibrate or be agitated in the same way as when the original impression was made. This being the case, it is natural to conclude, that when any part of the original perception is revived in the memory, the whole perception should be revived at once, so as that we cannot have an idea of the trunk of a tree without perceiving the ideas of the branches associated with it. This is indeed not merely natural, but the contrary seems to be impossible; for as the original agitation or vibration was occasioned by the whole tree, it is evident, that whatever effect or tendency that agitation or vibration left behind it, must be left by the whole vibration, and therefore be equally related to the whole tree.\n\nBut no object stands single in nature. When we view a tree, or any thing else, we always notice, however transiently, the field where it grows and the objects around it. These too leave effects in the brain at the same time that the tree does so; and therefore make their appearance with it in the memory or imagination: but if the tree was the object to which we principally attended during the actual sensation, the idea of it will be much more vivid than the idea of its adjuncts, and remain much longer in the imagination or memory; because the original sensation by which it was perceived, was struck much deeper than the sensations by which its adjuncts were perceived. All this must be intelligible to every one who attends to what we have already said of sensation, perception, and memory.\n\nThus we see why a picture leads our thoughts to the original, and why the mention of one apartment in a building introduces an inquiry concerning the others. It is not merely because the picture resembles the original, and because the apartments of a building are contiguous. Between a plain surface, variously coloured and shaded, and the contour of the human face, there is certainly very little real resemblance, as any man may be convinced who places his eye within six inches of a good picture. But the painter, having by his skill in perspective, contrived to lay his colours on the plain canvas in such a manner as that they reflect the same rays of light with the original, provided the spectator stand at the proper distance; these rays proceeding from the picture fall upon the eye in the same direction, and therefore give to the nerves and brain the very same impulse which was given by the original. When one apartment of a building is mentioned, we inquire concerning the others from the very same cause that, when we think of the trunk of a tree which we have seen, we cannot avoid thinking likewise of its branches.\n\nBut the principle of association takes place among things not naturally connected, as the apartments of a words of language;\n\n(9) This is certainly the case with adults, but it may be doubted whether it be so with very young children. It has been shown already, that the sensation communicated by the eye from any visible object, has not the least resemblance to that object; and that in looking at a tree or any thing else, a full-grown man pays not the least attention to the appearance which the tree really makes to his eye; nay, that he is not even conscious of that appearance farther than as it confits in colour. It is by the sense of touch only that we acquire ideas of figure, even of plain figure; and we imagine that we perceive them by the eye only because different figures, as distinguishable by touch, are so closely associated with their corresponding visible sensations, that long before we are capable of inquiry, these two things are inseparable in the imagination. It is otherwise with children, who, when they first begin to distinguish objects by the sense of sight, appear to do it, with great deliberation, as if they first felt the proper sensation of light and colour to or so modified, and afterwards acquired, by something like a mental inference, a notion of the figure at which they are looking.\nAssociation of ideas is a building and a substance and its attributes and adjuncts. It is association which is the original source of all the general or complex conceptions which we have, and which even gives meaning to the words of every language. Between sounds considered in themselves, and things, or the ideas of things, every one knows that there is no natural connexion; yet the idea of every known object is in the mind of every man so strictly associated with the name that it bears in its native tongue, that the presence of the one always suggests the other. It cannot indeed be otherwise, if we attend to the manner in which a child learns to affix a meaning to the words which he hears.\n\n\u2014A child knows his mother and nurse, and indeed almost every visible object in the family, long before he acquires the power of articulation. The impressions made by these objects, and repeated daily and hourly on his brain, every one of which excites a sensation, must soon become so deep as not to be easily effaced. Numbers of them too are associated together, so that the presence of one introduces the other. It has been already observed, that ideas of sight are the most vivid and the most lasting; but the child hearing the same sound often repeated, even that sound comes in time to leave in his memory a permanent idea. He then hears the sound nurse, for instance, uttered at the time when he is looking earnestly at the person of the nurse, with whom he is well acquainted, and to whom he is strongly attached; and having the two ideas repeatedly excited together, they soon become so associated, that the one necessarily excites the other: the word nurse calls into view the idea of the woman treasured up in his imagination.\n\nBut we need not have recourse to children for the proof of our assertion. It is obvious that the name of every simple and uncompounded idea can be significant only by association. Of a complex conception the name may be made intelligible by a definition; but simple ideas cannot be defined, and between ideas and sounds there is no natural connexion, so as that the one previous to association should suggest the other.\n\nEven of complex conceptions and mixed modes, the meaning of the names is generally acquired by association; for though it is certainly true, that all such names are capable of definition, they are yet used with sufficient propriety by thousands who know not what a definition is. Were a plain unlettered man asked to define virtue, it is not probable that he could do it so as to make himself understood; yet having ideas of the practice of justice, charity, fortitude, &c., strictly associated in his mind with the word virtue, he may know the general meaning of that word as well as the most acute grammarian or the most profound philosopher.\n\nAn alms is a donation to a poor man; but a child who never heard of this definition knows perfectly what an alms is, from having often seen his parents give money to a beggar, and call what they were doing by the name alms. The sound of the word, after having seen the first alms given, will excite in his mind an idea of the individual object who received it, and of the action of him by whom it was given; but after having seen several poor men relieved, he comes to associate with the word alms any thing given to any person who needs it or appears to be in want.\n\nSo completely does this association take place between ideas or clusters of ideas, and the words by which they are expressed, that even men of letters hear and understand perfectly many words without reviewing in their minds all the ideas and relations of which they are the signs. It has been already observed, that in talking of government, church, negotiation, conquest, we seldom spread out in our minds all the simple ideas of which the compound notions signified by these terms are composed; and we now add, that the terms may be used with sufficient propriety, and be perfectly understood by those who never attempted to analyze the notions of which they are significant into their primary and constituent parts. Every man has read numberless details of the transactions of one court with another; he has heard such transactions universally called by the term negotiation. The term and the transactions signified by it are so closely associated in his mind, that they are in a manner inseparable; and by this association he knows the meaning of the term better than he could have done by the most complete definition; which, perhaps, he would find it difficult to give, or even to comprehend.\n\nWe have said that the meaning of the word virtue is acquired by association, by having often heard that word applied to certain actions; but it is extremely improbable, that the very notion of virtue, simple and uncompounded as it appears to be, is acquired in the very same manner. The first rudiments of the notions of right and wrong and obligation seem to be acquired by a child when he finds himself checked and controlled by superior power. At first he feels nothing but mere force, and consequently has no notion of any kind of restraint but that of necessity. He finds he cannot have his will, and therefore submits. Afterwards he attends to many circumstances which distinguish the commands of a father, or of a master, from those of any other person. Notions of reverence, love, esteem, and dependence, are connected with the idea of him who gives those commands; and by degrees the child experiences the peculiar advantages of filial subjection. He sees also that all his companions, who are noticed and admired by others, obey their parents; and that those who are of a refractory disposition are universally disliked. These and other circumstances now begin to alter and modify the notion of mere necessity, till by degrees he considers the commands of a parent as something that must not be resisted or disputed, even though he has a power of doing it; and all these ideas coalescing, form the notions of moral right and moral obligation, which are easily transferred from the commands of a parent to those of a magistrate, of God, and of conscience. This opinion of the gradual formation of the ideas of moral right and wrong, from a great variety of elements associated together, perfectly accounts for that prodigious diversity in the sentiments of mankind respecting the objects of moral obligation; nor do we see that any other hypothesis can account for the facts. If the notion of moral obligation were a simple uncompounded idea, arising from the view of certain actions or sentiments; or were it acquired, as it certainly might be, by a chain of reasoning from the nature of God and the nature of man; why should it not in the one case be as invariable as the perception of colours or sounds, and in the other...\nAssociation other than our judgements of mathematical or physical truths? But though the shape and colour of a flower appear the same to every human eye; though every man of common understanding knows, that if a billiard ball be struck by another, it will move from its place with a velocity proportioned to the force of the impulse; and though all mankind who have but dipped into mathematics, perceive that any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side; yet one man practises as a moral duty what another looks upon with abhorrence, and reflects on with remorse. Now a thing that varies with education and instruction, as moral sentiments are known to do, certainly has the appearance of being generated by a series of different impressions and associations in some such manner as we have endeavoured to describe. Let not any man imagine that this account of the origin of moral sentiments endangers the cause of virtue; for whether those sentiments be instinctive or acquired, their operation is the very same, and in either case their rectitude must often be tried by the test of reason, so that the interests of virtue are equally safe on this as on any other scheme. See Moral Philosophy.\n\nThis principle of association has so great an influence over all our actions, passions, reasonings, and judgements, that there is not perhaps any one thing which deserves more to be looked after in the education of youth. Some of our ideas\u2014such as those of a substance and its attributes, a genus and the species contained under it, a species and its several individuals, have a real connexion with each other in nature. These it is the office of our reason to trace out and to hold together in that union and order in which nature presents them to the view of the mind; for such associations constitute perhaps the greatest part of necessary and of useful truths. But there are others formed by custom and caprice, which are too often the sources of error, superstition, vice, and misery\u2014of errors the more dangerous, and of vice the more deplorable; that if the associations have been long formed without an attempt to dissolve them, they generally become at last too strong to be broken by the most vigorous effort of the best-disposed mind. Thus, let a foolish maid amuse or rather frighten children with stories of ghosts appearing in the dark, let her repeat these fictions till they have made a deep impression on the young minds, and the notion of ghosts will in time become so closely associated with the idea of darkness, that the one shall always introduce the other; and it may not be in the power of the children, after they have become men, and are convinced in their judgements of the falsehood and absurdity of the tales which originally frightened them, to separate entirely the notion of ghosts from the idea of darkness, or with perfect ease to remain alone in a dark room. Again, let the idea of infallibility be annexed to any person or society, and let these two inseparably united constantly possess the mind; and then one body in ten thousand places at once shall, unexamined, be swallowed for an incontrovertible fact, whenever that infallible person or society dictates or demands assent without inquiry.\n\nSome such wrong and unnatural combinations of ideas will be found to establish the irreconcilable opposition that we find between different feelings in philosophy and religion; for we cannot imagine every individual of any feet to impose wilfully on himself, and knowingly to reject truth offered by plain reason. That which leads men of sincerity and good sense blindfold, will be found, when inquired into, to be some early and wrong association. Ideas independent and of no alliance to one another, are by education, custom, and the constant din of their party, so linked together in their minds, that they can no more be separated from each other than if they were but one idea; and they operate upon the judgement as if they really were but one. This gives sense to jargon, the force of demonstration to absurdities, and consistency to nonsense; it is the foundation of the greatest and most dangerous errors in the world; for as far as it obtains, it hinders men from seeing and examining.\n\nBefore we dilate the subject of association, it may be proper to inquire, how far it is agreeable to the account which we have given of the manner in which external objects are perceived by means of the senses, and the ideas of such objects retained in the memory.\n\nIt has been proved, we think, by arguments unanswerable, that by the organs of sense nothing is conveyed immediately to the mind but sensations which can have no resemblance to external objects, and rates in our perception that the perception of an object may be resolved into a process of reasoning from effects to causes.\u2014But children, it will be said, do not reason from effects to causes, and yet they soon acquire the faculty of perceiving and distinguishing the objects with which they are surrounded. This is an undoubted truth, and it can be accounted for only by the principle of association. A child has as much the use of his senses as a full-grown man. By his eye he has the sensation of colour; by his nose, that of smell; by his ear he has the sensation of sound; and by his hand he feels heat and cold, resistance and bounded resistance. Every object which is presented to him, impresses his mind with various sensations; and these sensations combined together are probably all that he perceives for some years; for there is no reason to imagine that a boy of one or two years old has the slightest notion of what we mean by solidity, hardness, softness, or indeed of that which is termed substance. Yet when two or more objects are present, he may easily distinguish the one from the other, because the sensations excited by the one must differ from those excited by the other, as much as the real qualities of the one are different from the real qualities of the other; and by distinguishing between his own sensations, he in effect distinguishes between the objects which produce these sensations. His sensations too being frequently excited, leave behind them ideas in his memory, or imagination; and these ideas, from having been imprinted together and never separated, become in time so closely associated, that whenever one of them is called into view, the others necessarily make their appearance with it. Thus a child has a set of combined sensations excited in his mind by the presence of his nurse; he has a different cluster excited, suppose, by the presence of his mother. These are often repeated, and leave deep traces behind them; so that when the mother or the nurse makes her appearance, she is immediately recognised as a known object; or, to speak more correctly, the child feels the very same sensations.\nAssociation which he has felt before, from which he has experienced pleasure, and of which he has the ideas treasured up in his memory or imagination. A stranger, on the other hand, might affect him with a set of new sensations, and of course will be distinguished from a known object as accurately as if the child were possessed of the notions of solidity, substance, qualities, and distance. A man born blind, who knew not that such things as fire and snow had ever existed, would yet distinguish the one from the other the moment that he should be brought within their influence. He could not indeed apply their names properly, nor say which is the fire and which the snow, nor would he at first have any notion of either of them as a real, external, and distant object; but he would certainly distinguish his own sensations, the sensation of heat from that of cold. It is just so with a child: At first he perceives nothing but different sensations. These he can distinguish; and as they are caused by different objects, in distinguishing between the sensations he will appear to distinguish between the objects themselves. In a short time, however, he acquires, by the following process, some inaccurate notions of distance. He looks, for instance, earnestly in his nurse's face, and at the same time touches her cheek perhaps by accident. He repeats this operation frequently, till the sensation communicated by his eye comes to be associated with that of his touch, and with the extending of his arm; and being all treasured up as associated ideas in the memory, the sight of his nurse makes him ever afterwards stretch out his hands with a desire to touch her. All this while there is not the slightest probability that the child has any notion of substance or qualities, or of anything beyond his own sensations, and the means by which he has experienced, that sensations which are pleasant may be obtained, and that such as are painful may be avoided. The precise time at which a child begins to think of external things we cannot pretend to ascertain; but we are persuaded that it is later than many persons imagine, and certainly not till he has made considerable progress in the exercise of reason. Prior to that period the things which men know to be bodies, are known to children only as sensations and ideas strongly bound together by the tie of association.\n\nBut if association be of such importance in the act of sensation, it is of still greater in that of retention; for it seems to constitute the whole difference that there is between imagination and memory. By many of the ancients, as well as by some modern philosophers, these two faculties seem to have been confounded with each other; but between them there is certainly a great difference, though they likewise resemble each other in some respects. An idea of memory, considered by itself, makes the very same appearance to the intellect as an idea of imagination. We contemplate both as if they were actual, though faint and distant perceptions: but the one is attended with the conviction, that it is the idea of an object which has really been perceived at some period of past time; whilst the other is attended with no conviction, except that the idea itself is actually present to the mind. Mr Hume has said, that ideas of memory differ from those of imagination only in being more vivid and distinct; but certainly this is not always the case. An idea of imagination has sometimes been taken for a real perception, which an idea of memory can never be. The difference between these two kinds of ideas, we are persuaded, arises chiefly, if not wholly, from association. Every idea of memory is associated with many others, and those again with others down to the very moment of the energy of remembrance; whereas ideas of imagination are either the voluntary creatures of the fancy at the moment of their appearance, in which case we should call them conceptions; or they are ideas which we have actually received from sensation, but which, on account of some link being broken in the vast chain of association, we cannot refer to any real objects. What gives probability to this conjecture is, that ideas often appear in the mind which we know not whether to refer to the memory or imagination, nothing being more common than to hear a person say, I have in my head the idea of such or such an object; but whether I remember or only imagine the object, I am very uncertain. Afterwards, however, by turning the idea over and over in the mind, he finds other ideas make their appearance, till at last clutters of them come into view, and associate so closely with the principal idea, which was the object of doubt, as to convince the judgement that it is an idea of memory.\n\nIt has been asked, Why we believe what we distinctly remember? and to that question it has been supposed that no answer can be given. But it appears to us, that association is the ground of belief in this as it will be found to be in other instances; and that a man believes he washed his hands and face in the morning, because the idea of that operation is so strongly linked in his mind to the whole train of ideas which have arisen in it through the day, that he cannot separate the first from the last, that which was a sensation in the morning from the sensations which are present at the instant of remembrance. As those ideas are associated by nature, each must pass in review in its proper order; so that in so short a space of time there is no danger, and hardly a possibility, of taking the first for the last, or the last for the first. Nay more, we will venture to hazard an opinion, that every past event of a man's life, which he distinctly remembers, is tied by the chain of association to his present perceptions. That this is possible is certain, since it is not difficult to conceive how it may be done. The principal events of a single day may surely be so linked together as to be all distinctly reviewed in a cluster of ideas on the morrow. Of these events some one or other must be the most important, which will therefore make its appearance as an idea more frequently than the rest, and be more closely associated with the events of next day. Some event of that day will, for the same reason, be more closely associated with it than the others; and these two, dropping perhaps all the rest of their original companions, will pass on together to the third day, and so on through weeks, and months, and years. In the compass of a year, several things must occur to make deep impressions on the mind. These will at first be associated together by events of little importance, like the occurrences of a single day. Whilst these feeble chains, however, continue unbroken, they will be sufficient to link the\nChap. V. METAPHYSICS.\n\nAssociation one important event to the other, and to bring them both into view at the same time, till at last these two, from appearing so often together, will in time unite of themselves, and the intermediate ideas be completely effaced. Thus may two or three important events of one year be associated with such a number of similar events of another year, so that the ideas of the one shall always introduce to the mind the ideas of the other; and this chain of association may pass from the earliest event which we distinctly remember through all the intermediate years of our lives down to the instant when memory is exerted.\n\nTo this account of memory it may perhaps be objected, that it gives us no distinct notion of time. Every thing that is remembered is necessarily believed to have been present in some portion of past time; but association brings into view nothing but a series of events. This objection will be seen to have no weight when we have inquired into the nature of time, and ascertained what kind of a thing it is. It will then perhaps appear, that duration itself, as apprehended by us, is not distinguishable from a series of events; and that if there were no train of thought passing through our minds, nor any motion among the objects around us, time could have no existence. Meanwhile, whatever become of this opinion, we beg leave to observe, that our theory of remembrance is perfectly consistent with the commonly received notions respecting time; and indeed, that it is the only theory which can account for numberless phenomena respecting past duration. It is universally allowed, that if motion or a succession of events, do not constitute time, it is the only thing by which time can be measured. Now it is a fact which no man will deny, that the distance of time from the present now or instant to the earliest period which he distinctly remembers, appears to his view extremely short, much shorter than it is said to be in reality; and that one year, when he looks forward, appears longer than two, perhaps longer than ten, when he looks backward. Upon our principles this fact is easily accounted for. We remember nothing which is not linked by a chain of associations with the perceptions of the present moment; and as none but a few of the most important events of our lives can be linked together in this manner, it hence follows, that events which, in the order of succession, were far distant from each other, must thus be brought together in the memory, and the whole chain be contracted within very short limits. But when we figure to ourselves a series of future events, we employ the active power of fancy instead of the passive capacity of retention; and can therefore bring within the compass of one periodical revolution of the sun a longer series of imaginary events succeeding each other, than is preserved of real events in our memory from the earliest period of our existence: So perfectly does our theory accord with this well-known fact. On the other hand, if memory be an original faculty of the mind totally independent of association,\n\nVol. XIII. Part II.\n\nand of which no other account is to be given than Of Consciousness and Reflection.\n\nSensation, remembrance, simple apprehension, and Conscious-conception, with every other actual energy or passion, what is the mind, is accompanied with an inward feeling or perception of that energy or passion; and that feeling or perception is termed consciousness. Consciousness is the perception of what passes in a man's own mind at the instant of its passing there; nor can we see, hear, taste, smell, remember, apprehend, conceive, employ our faculties in any manner, enjoy any pleasure, or suffer any pain, without being conscious of what we are doing, enjoying, or suffering. Consciousness is only of things present*; and to apply it to things past, is to confound consciousness with memory or reflection. One says on the cannot say that he is conscious of what he has seen or heard and now remembers: he is only conscious of the act of remembrance; which, though it respects a past event, is itself a present energy. It is likewise to be observed, that consciousness is only of things in the mind or conscious being, and not of things external. It is improper in any person to say that he is conscious.\n\n(r) Since this was written Mr Stewart's Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind have been published; in which the reader will find many excellent remarks on the nature and influence of the associating principle.\nOf Conscioufness and Reflection.\n\nof the table before him: he perceives it, he see it, and he may with great propriety say that he is conscious he perceives or sees it; but he cannot say that he is conscious of the table itself, for it is only his immediate energy of perception that can be the object of consciousness. All the operations of our minds are attended with consciousness; which is the only evidence that we have or can have of their existence. Should a man take it into his head to think or to lay that his consciousness may deceive him, and to require a proof that it cannot, we know of no proof that can be given him: he must be left to himself as a man that denies first principles, without which there can be no reasoning. Every attempt to prove this point, or to fet it in a clearer light, would only serve to render it more dark and unintelligible. I think, I feel, I exist, are first truths, and the basis of all human knowledge.\n\nThis has given rise to the question, whether Des Cartes did not fall into an absurdity when, inferring his own existence from his actual thought, he said, Cogito, ergo sum. This argument has been called a pitiful sophism, and a petitio principii; because, before a man take it for granted that he thinks, he must also, it is said, take it for granted that he exists, since there cannot be thought where there is no existence. Now it must be confessed, that if Des Cartes pretended by this argument to give us a fresh conviction of our own existence, his endeavours were useless and puerile; because a man capable of being convinced by the arguments of another, must have a previous conviction of his own existence: but the argument itself is certainly neither a sophism nor a petitio principii. Those who defend Des Cartes assert, and there is no reason to doubt the truth of their assertion, that his only view in urging such an argument was not to prove the truth of our existence, but to exhibit the order of that process by which we arrive at the knowledge of the fact; and this he has very clearly done by analyzing the truth into its first principles. A stone exists as well as the human mind; but has the stone any knowledge of its own existence? No man will say that it has; neither should we have any knowledge of ours, did we think as little as the stone. We certainly might exist without thinking, as it is probable we do in very sound sleep; and in that state our existence might be known to other beings, but it could not possibly be known to ourselves: for the only things of which the mind is conscious, or has immediate knowledge, are its own operations. I exist is therefore a legitimate inference from the proposition I think; and the observation that it is so may be useful to show us the procedure of the mind in the acquisition of knowledge; but it has little merit as an argument, and still less as a discovery, though, being strictly true and just, it should never have been exposed to ridicule.\n\nIt is to be observed, that we are conscious of many things to which we give very little attention. We can hardly attend to several things at the same time; and our attention is commonly employed about that which is the object of our thought, and rarely about the thought itself. It is in our power, however, when we come to the years of understanding, to give attention to our own thoughts and passions, and the various operations of our minds. And when we make these the objects of our attention, either while they are present, or when they are recent and fresh in our memory, we perform an act of the mind which is properly called reflection. This reflection ought to be distinguished from consciousness; with which it is confused sometimes by Locke, and often by the learmen on the ed author of Ancient Metaphysics. All men are consciousness of the operations of their own minds at all times while they are awake, nor does it appear that brutes can be wholly destitute of consciousness; but there are few men who reflect upon the operations of their minds, or make them the objects of thought; and it is not probable that any species of brutes do so.\n\nFrom infancy, till we come to the years of understanding, we are employed solely about sensible objects. And although the mind is conscious of its operations, it does not attend to them; its attention is turned solely to the objects about which these operations are employed. Thus, when a man is angry, he is conscious of his passion; but his attention is turned to the person who offended him and the circumstances of the offence, while the passion of anger is not in the least the object of his attention. The difference between consciousness and reflection, is like the difference between a superficial view of an object which presents itself to the eye, while we are engaged about something else, and that attentive examination which we give to an object when we are wholly employed in surveying it. It is by consciousness that we immediately acquire all the knowledge which we have of mental operations; but attentive reflection is necessary to make that knowledge accurate and distinct. Attention is a voluntary act; it requires some exertion to begin and continue it; and by great exertion it may be continued for a considerable time; but consciousness is involuntary, and of no continuance, changing with every thought. The power of reflection upon the operations of their own minds does not at all appear in children. Men must have come to some ripeness of understanding before they are capable of it. Of all the powers of the human mind it seems to be the last that unfolds itself. Most men seem incapable of acquiring it in any considerable degree; and many circumstances conspire to make it to all men an exercise of difficulty. The difficulty, however, must be conquered, or no progress can be made in the science of our own or of other minds.\n\nAll the notions which we have of mind and of its operations are got by reflection; and these notions are of by Mr Locke called ideas of reflection. This term we think extremely ill chosen; and we believe it has been the source of much error and confusion among Locke's followers. A man, by attending to the operations of his own mind, may have as distinct notions of remembrance, of judgement, of will, of desire, as of any object whatever: but if the secondary perception of a sensible object, that appearance which it has to the mind when viewed in the memory or imagination, be properly called an idea, it is certain that of the operations of the mind itself there can be no ideas; for these operations, when reflected on, make no appearance without their objects either in the memory or in the imagination. Nothing is more evident, in fact, than that we have no ideas, in the original and proper meaning of the word, but of sensible objects upon which the mind exerts its first operations. Of these operations we have indeed a consciousness;\nOf Consciousness and Reflection.\n\nConsciousness; but abstracted from their objects we cannot frame of them any idea or resemblance. We are conscious of ourselves of thinking, willing, remembering, discerning, reasoning, judging, &c., but let any one look into himself, and try whether he can there find any idea of thinking or willing, &c., entirely separate and abstracted from the object of thought or will. Every man who has seen a tree or horse, will find in his mind ideas of these objects, which he can contemplate by themselves, independent of every thing else; but no man can contemplate the idea of thinking or desiring without taking into view the thing thought on or desired. It is plain, therefore, that the energies of thinking, willing, and desiring, with all their various modifications, are not themselves ideas, or capable of communicating ideas to be apprehended, as the ideas of bodies are apprehended by the pure intellect. They are the actions and workings of the intellect itself upon ideas which we receive from the objects of sense, and which are treasured up in the memory or imagination for the very purpose of furnishing the intellect with materials to work upon. Between ideas and the energies of thinking there is as great and as obvious a difference as there is between a stone and the energies of him by whom it is cast. Ideas are the passive subjects; the energies of thinking are the operations of the agents. Ideas are relics of sensation, and have a necessary relation to things external; the energies of thinking are relics of nothing, and they are wholly and originally internal.\n\nThat we can in no sense of the word be said to have ideas of the operation of the intellect, will be still more evident, if we consider by what means we acquire the knowledge which we have of those operations. It has been already observed, that when our thoughts are employed upon any subject, though we are conscious of thinking, yet our attention is commonly employed upon the object of our thought, and not upon the thought itself; and that if we would give attention to our thoughts and passions, we must do it by a reflex act of the mind, whilst the act of thinking is still recent and fresh in our memory. Thus, if a man wishes to know what perception is, it is not the time to make the inquiry while he is looking at some rare or beautiful object; for though he is conscious of the energy of perceiving, the object of perception employs all his attention. But the time to make this inquiry is either when the object has become familiar to him, or presently after it is removed from his sight. In the former case, he can look upon it without emotion, pay attention to every step in the process of perception, and be immediately conscious what perception is. In the latter case, by turning his attention inwards, and reflecting on what he did or felt when the object was before him, he will find clear and vivid ideas of every thing which he perceived by his sense of sight; but he will find no idea of the act of seeing or perceiving. On the contrary, if he be capable of sufficient attention, he will observe that his intellect is employed in the very same manner upon the ideas that it was upon the original sensations; and of that employment, and the manner of it, he will be equally conscious as he was of the original energy exerted in sensation. There is indeed this difference between the two, without which reflection could make no discoveries, that the most vivid ideas being still faint when compared with actual sensations, the intellect is not so wholly engrossed by them, as it was by the original objects, nor is it so rapidly carried from idea to idea as it was from sensation to sensation. It is thus at leisure to attend to its own operations, and to know what they are; though to form ideas of them as separate from their objects, is absolutely impossible. Every man capable of paying attention to what passes within himself when he sees, hears, and feels, &c., may have very accurate notions of seeing, hearing, and feeling, &c.; but he cannot have ideas of them as he has of the objects of sight, hearing, and touch.\n\nThe same is the case with respect to the exertion of our reasoning faculties. A man must have distinct and clear ideas to reason upon, but he can have no idea of reasoning itself, though he must be conscious of it, and by attention may know what it is. When a man sits down to study for the first time a proposition in the Elements of Euclid, he certainly employs his reasoning faculty, and is conscious that he is doing so; but his attention is wholly turned to the diagram before him, and to the several ideas which the diagram suggests. Afterwards, when he has mastered the proposition, he may go over it again, with a view to discover what reasoning is; but he will not find he has any idea of reasoning as he has of the diagram. He will only exert that faculty a second time, and perceive one trunk linked to and depending upon another in such a manner that the whole taken together forms a complete demonstration. In a word, the operations of our own minds, when attention is paid to them, are known immediately by consciousness; and it is as impossible that we should have ideas of them, as that a living man should be a picture upon canvas. He who attends to what passes in his own mind when he perceives, remembers, reasons, or wills, must know by consciousness what these operations are, and be capable of forming very accurate notions of them, as connected with their objects; and he who does not attend to what passes in his own mind will never acquire any notions of them, though he were to read all that has been written on the subject from the days of Pythagoras to those of Dr. Reid.\n\nAs we acquire ideas of external objects by means of our senses; and notions of perceiving, remembering, reasoning, and willing, &c., by reflecting on the operations of our own minds; so there are other things of which we acquire notions, partly by sensation and partly by reflection, and partly by means of that faculty of which it is the more peculiar office to compare ideas and to perceive truth. Such are substance, body, mind, with their several qualities, adjuncts, relations; the knowledge of which, as has been already observed, constitutes what in strictness of speech is termed the science of metaphysics. These shall be considered in order, after we have investigated the nature of truth, and inquired into the several sources of evidence; but there is one notion, about the origin and reality of which there have been so many disputes, which in itself is of so great importance, and which will be so intimately connected with all our subsequent inquiries, that it may not be improper to consider it here.\u2014The notion to which we allude is of power.\n\nAmong the objects around us we perceive frequent changes, and one event regularly succeeding another, how acquired.\nGold thrown into the fire is changed from a solid to a fluid body. Water exposed to a certain degree of cold is changed from a fluid to a solid body. Night succeeds to day, and summer succeeds to winter. We are conscious of new sensations in ourselves every hour. We are likewise conscious of reasoning, willing, and desiring; and we know that by an exertion of will we can rise or sit, stand still or walk, call one idea into view, and dismiss others from our contemplation. Experience teaches us, that it is not occasionally, but always, that gold is changed into a fluid by being thrown into the fire, and water into a solid body by being exposed to a certain degree of cold; that night succeeds to day, and summer to winter. These changes have regularly taken place since the creation of the world; and it has never once been observed that water was made solid by fire, or gold rendered liquid by cold.\n\nWere we not assured by experience that our own voluntary motions are produced by exertions of our minds, of which we are conscious, and that without such exertions those motions would never have taken place, we should probably have considered the liquefaction of gold as an event equally independent of fire, though uniformly conjoined with it, as night is independent of day, and day of night. But having experienced that we can move or not move our bodies as we please; that when it is our will to sit, we never get up to walk; and that when we wish to walk, we always do it except prevented by external violence: having likewise experienced, that by a thought, by some internal and inexplicable exertion of our minds, we can call up in our memory or imagination one idea and dismiss others from our mental view; we are led to believe with the fullest conviction, that all those motions of our bodies which in common language are termed voluntary, and that succession of ideas which follows a conscious exertion of the mind, depend upon ourselves. In other words, we are necessitated to believe that we have a power to move or not move our bodies in many cases, and a power to turn our attention to one idea in preference to others.\n\nIt is thus that we acquire the notion of power in ourselves, which we easily transfer to other objects. Knowing that the various motions of our bodies thus effected proceed from power, we are naturally led to inquire whether the changes which we perceive in other bodies may not proceed from power likewise, i.e., from something analogous to that power, of the exertions of which we are conscious. Now uniform experience teaching us that gold is liquefied by being thrown into the fire, and that water is made solid by being exposed to cold; we infer with the utmost certainty that there are powers in fire and cold to produce these changes, and that without the exertion of such powers these changes would not be produced. We cannot indeed say of external powers, as we can of our own, in what substance they inheres. We know with the utmost certainty that the voluntary motions of our hands, &c., are produced by a power not inherent in the hands but in the mind, for of the exertion of that power we are conscious; but we do not know whether the power which liquefies gold be inherent in that sensible object which we call fire, or in something else to which fire is only an instrument.\n\nWe learn by observation, that the minute particles of fire or heat infuse themselves between the particles of gold, and, if we may use the expression, tear them asunder; but whether they do this in consequence of a power inherent in themselves, or only as instruments impelled by another power, is a question which observation cannot enable us to answer.\n\nWere we not conscious of the exertion of our own powers, it seems not conceivable that we could ever have acquired any notion of power at all; for power is not an object of sense, nor, independent of its operations, it is indeed an object of consciousness. In external operations, all that we perceive is one thing, in which we suppose the power to reside, followed by another, which is either the change or that on which the change is produced; but the exertion of the power itself we do not perceive. Thus we perceive gold, after it has been some time in the fire, converted from a solid to a fluid body; but we perceive not by our senses either the power or the energy of the power which operates to this conversion. In the exercise of our own powers, the case is otherwise. When a man puts his hand to his head, and afterwards thrusts it into his bosom, he not only perceives by his senses the change of position, but is also conscious of the energy or exertion by which the change was produced.\n\n\"Suppose (says Mr Hume) a person, though endowed with the strongest faculties of reason and reflection, to be brought on a sudden into this world; he would indeed immediately observe a continual succession of objects, and one event following another, but he would not be able to discover anything farther. He would not at first by any reasoning be able to reach the idea of cause and effect; since the particular powers by which all natural operations are performed never appear to the senses. The impulse of one billiard ball is attended with motion in the second. This is the whole that appears to the outward senses. The mind feels no sentiment or inward impression from this succession of objects; consequently there is not, in any single particular instance of cause and effect, any thing which can suggest the idea of power or necessary connexion. From the first appearance of an object, we never can conjecture what effect will result from it; but, were the power or energy of any cause discoverable by the mind, we could foresee the effect even without experience; and might at first pronounce with certainty concerning it by the mere dint of thought and reasoning. It is impossible, therefore, that the idea of power can be derived from the contemplation of bodies in single instances of their operations; because no bodies ever discover any power which can be the original of this idea.\"\n\nThere is a sense in which this reasoning is unquestionably just. A man who had never been conscious of exerting power in himself, would certainly not acquire the notion of power from observing a continual succession of external objects. The impulse of one billiard ball being followed by the motion of another, would no more lead him to the notion of power in the former, than the succession of night to day would lead him to the notion of a power in light to produce darkness. When Mr Hume says, \"that from the first appearance of an object we can never conjecture what ef-\nChap VI.\n\nOf Confining and Reflection.\n\nIf it be meant, that after having reflected on the operations of our own minds, and learned by experience that motion is communicated by impulse from one ball of ivory to another, we could not conjecture whether a similar effect would be produced by the impulse of balls made of other hard bodies which we had never before seen, the assertion is manifestly false. A man who had but once seen motion communicated in this manner from one ivory ball to another, would certainly conjecture that it might be communicated from one wooden ball to another; and if he had seen it repeatedly communicated from one ball to another of different substances, he would infer, with the utmost confidence, that it might be communicated from ball to ball of whatever substance composed, provided that substance be hard, or of a similar texture with the balls to the impulse of which he had formerly paid attention. If by this ambiguous phrase the author only means, as is probably the case, that from the first appearance of an object to which we had never before observed any thing in any respect similar, we could not conjecture what effect would result from it; or if his meaning be, that a man suddenly brought into the world, who had never acquired such a notion of power as may be had from attention to the energies and operations of our own minds, would not, by observing an effect to result from one body, conjecture from the first appearance of another similar body what effect would result from it; in either of these cases his assertion is certainly true, and tends to prove, that without the confiningness of the operations of our own minds we could never acquire a notion of power from the changes perceived by our senses in external objects.\n\nBut Mr Hume, not contented with denying, which he might justly do, that we could ever have derived the idea of power merely from observing the continual succession of external objects, labours hard to prove that we have no notion of power at all, and that when we use the word power, we do nothing more than utter an insignificant sound. To pave the way for the arguments by which so extravagant a paradox is to be supported, he lays it down as a \"proposition which will not admit of much dispute, that all our ideas are nothing but copies of our impressions; or, in other words, that it is impossible for us to think of anything that we have not antecedently felt either by our external or internal senses.\" As this proposition, however, will admit, it seems, of some dispute, he takes care, before he applies it to the purpose of demolishing all power, to support it by two arguments. \"First (says he), when we analyze our thoughts or ideas, however compounded or sublime, we always find that they resolve themselves into such simple ideas as were copied from a precedent feeling or sentiment. Those who would assert, that this position is not universally true nor without exception, have only one, and that an easy method of refuting it; by producing that idea, which, in their opinion, is not derived from this source. Secondly, If it happen, from a defect of the organ, that a man is not susceptible of any species of sensation, we always find that he is as little susceptible of the correspondent ideas. A blind man can form no notion of colours, a deaf man of sounds. And though there are few or no instances of a like deficiency in the mind, where a person has never felt, or is wholly incapable of a sentiment or passion that belongs to his species; yet we find the same observation to take place in a less degree. A man of mild manners can form no idea of inveterate revenge or cruelty; nor can a selfish heart easily conceive the heights of friendship and generosity.\"\n\nAs these propositions are the engines by which all his reasoning is banished from the world, it may not be improper, before we proceed to inquire by what means, they perform so arduous a task, to consider their own inherent strength; for if they be weak in themselves, their work, however dexterously they may be employed, can have no stability. We have already noticed the perverseness of this writer's language, when it confounds sensations with impressions; but here it is still more perverse, for passions, sentiments, and even consciousnesses, are styled impressions. When sensations are confounded with impressions, the effect is only mistaken for the cause, it being universally known that sensations proceed from impressions made upon the organs of sense. When consciousness is confounded with an impression, one thing is mistaken for another, to which it is universally known to have neither resemblance nor relation. But, not to waste time upon these fallacies, which, though dangerous if admitted, are yet too palpable to impose upon a reader capable of the slightest attention, let us examine the propositions themselves. The most important, and that for the sake of which alone the others are brought forward, is, that it is impossible for us to think of anything that we have not immediately felt, either by our external or internal senses.\" Did Mr Hume then never think of a mathematical point, or a mathematical line? Neither of these things is capable of being felt either by making an impression upon the organs of sense or as an object of consciousness; and therefore it is impossible that he should ever have had ideas of them, such as he doubtless had of sensible objects; yet in the most proper sense of the word think (s), he certainly thought of both points and lines; for he appears to have made considerable progress in the science of geometry, in which he could not have proceeded a single step without a perfect knowledge of these things, on which the whole science is built. It is not therefore true, that our thoughts or ideas, when analyzed, always resolve themselves into such simple ideas as were copied from a precedent feeling or sentiment; for every mathematical figure of which we can think resolves itself into a point and motion; and a point having\n\n(s) Thinking, in the propriety of the English tongue, signifies that sort of operation of the mind about its ideas wherein the mind is active; where it, with some degree of voluntary attention, considers any thing.\u2014Locke.\nOf consciousness and no magnitude, cannot possibly be the object of feeling to any of our senses. If, therefore, ideas alone be the objects of thought, we have refuted Mr Hume's position by the very method which he himself lays down; for we have produced an idea which is not derived either from a precedent feeling or a precedent sentiment. By sentiment, we suppose to be here meant that which by other philosophers is denominated consciousness; and of consciousness it is undeniable that nothing is the object but the actual energies of our own minds.\n\nBut ideas are not the only objects of thought. We have already given our reasons for restricting the word idea to that appearance which an object of sense, when reflected on, makes either in the memory or imagination. Such was undoubtedly its original signification; and had it never been used to denote other and very different objects, much error and perplexity would have been avoided, which now disgrace the science of metaphysics. Things may themselves be the objects of thought; and when that is the case, to think of their ideas, were it possible to do so, would be worse than useless; for we may certainly know a man better by looking at himself than by looking at his picture. Of things which are themselves the objects of thought, we have either a direct or a relative knowledge. We know directly the actual operations of our own minds by the most complete of all evidence, that of consciousness; and we have a relative notion of mathematical points and lines: but neither of mental energies nor of these external things (t) can we possibly have any idea.\n\nIt is well observed by Dr Reid*, that our notions both of body and mind are nothing more than relative. \"What is body? It is, say philosophers, that which is extended, solid, and divisible. Says the querist, I do not ask what the properties of body are, but what is the thing itself? let me first know distinctly what body is, and then consider its properties. To this demand I am afraid the querist will meet with no satisfactory answer; because our notion of body is not direct, but relative to its qualities. We know that it is something extended, solid, and divisible, and we know no more. Again, If it should be asked, what is mind? It is that which thinks. I ask not what it does, or what its properties are, but what it is? To this I can find no answer; our notion of consciousness and mind being not direct, but relative to its operations, as our notion of body is relative to its qualities (u).\"\n\nOur notion of a mathematical point is of the very same kind. What is a point? It is, says Euclid, that which hath no parts and no magnitude. Replies the querist, I ask not either what it has or what it has not, but let me first know what it is? To this second question, the utmost it might perhaps be answered, that a mathematical precision: point is that which by motion generates a line. But, rejoins the querist, I am not inquiring what it generates; give me a direct idea of the point itself? or, if that cannot be done, as surely it cannot, tell me what its offspring a line is? A line, says Euclid, is length without breadth. I have no idea, replies the querist, of length without breadth. I never felt an impression from a sensible object which did not suggest length, breadth, and thickness, as inseparably united; and I can have no idea which is not the copy of a former impression. To assist the querist's conception, it may be said that lines are the boundaries of a superficies, and that superficies are the boundaries of a solid body; but of a solid body every man has a clear and direct idea, in the most proper sense of the word. Here then are several things, viz. points, lines, and superficies, of not one of which is it possible to form a direct notion; and yet we know them so thoroughly, from the relation which they bear to other subjects, that we can reason about them with a precision and certainty which only the mathematical sciences admit.\n\nThe great advantage of these sciences above the moral, Mr Hume himself expressly admits; but he is powerless to attribute it to a wrong cause, when he says it consists in this, that the \"ideas of the former being sensible are always clear and determinate;\" for we see that the notion of a point or of a line is merely relative, and cannot possibly be the copy of a sensation, or, in his language, of a sensible impression. If then we have clear and determinate notions of points and lines, and may reason about them without ambiguity, as he acknowledges we may, what is there to hinder us from having an equally clear and determinate notion of power, or from reasoning about it with as little ambiguity (v); Why says he, we are not conscious of power. And to prove this position, which needs no proof,\n\n(t) By calling mathematical points and lines external things, we do not mean to attribute to them any corporeal existence. We know well that they are merely creatures of the mind, and that if there were no mind, they could have no existence. But twenty men may at the same instant have a notion of the same lines and the same points; and therefore these lines and points have an existence independent of, and external to, any one mind, at least to any one human mind. The objects, however, of which a man is conscious, are in no sense whatever external, for they are present to no human mind but his own.\n\n(u) The opinions of philosophers concerning corporeal and spiritual substances shall be considered more fully hereafter. In quoting from Dr Reid on another subject, we have been obliged to anticipate his opinion, which will be found to be not more modest than just.\n\n(v) \"There are some things of which we can have both a direct and relative conception. I can directly conceive ten thousand men, or ten thousand pounds, because both are objects of sense, and may be seen. But whether I see such an object, or directly conceive it, my notion of it is indistinct; it is only that of a great multitude of men, or of a great heap of money; and a small addition or diminution makes no perceptible change in the notion I form in this way. But I can form a relative notion of the same number of men or of pounds by attending to the relations which this number has to other numbers greater or less. Then I perceive that the relative notion is distinct and scientific; for the addition of a single man, or a single pound, or even\nproof, he makes many observations that, however just, might certainly have been spared. Of these one is, that \"a man suddenly struck with a palsy in the leg or arm, or who had now lost these members, frequently endeavours at first to move them, and employ them in their usual offices. Here he is as much conscious of power to command such limbs, as a man in perfect health is conscious of power to activate any member which remains in its natural state and condition.\" But consciousness never deceives. Consequently, neither in the one case nor in the other are we ever conscious of any power.\" This is true; we never are conscious of any power; but we are frequently conscious of actual energies: and the man who, after being suddenly struck with a palsy, endeavours in vain to move his leg or arm, is as conscious of energy as he who in health makes the attempt with success. Nor let it be imagined that his consciousness deceives him; for, as Mr Hume justly observes, consciousness never deceives. He is certain of the energy, but finds by experience that the instrument of this energy has suddenly become disordered and unfit for its usual office. In this and this alone consists the difference between the paralytic and the man whose limbs are found. The one may be as conscious of energy as the other, and his consciousness may be equally infallible. What then is this energy? Mr Hume will not say that it is an idea, for it is not the copy of any antecedent impression; besides, he has somewhere allowed that ideas are never active. Is it then a substance? Impossible! for it is not permanent; and we believe no man will venture to affirm, or even to suppose, that the same substance can be repeatedly annihilated, and as often created. Is it then the occasional exertion of some substance? This must be the truth; for no other supposition remains to be made. If so, that substance must be possessed of power; for a capacity of exerting actual energy is all that is meant by the word power.\n\n\"Wherever there is a capability of energy or exertion, there must be power; for though there can be no exertion without power, there may be power that\n\n*Reid's Essays on the Active Powers of Man.\n\nof a penny, is easily perceived. In like manner, I can form a direct notion of a polygon of a thousand equal sides and equal angles. This direct notion cannot be more distinct when conceived in the mind, than that which I get by sight when the object is before me; and I find it so indistinct that it has the same appearance to my eye, or to my direct conception, as a polygon of a thousand and one, or of nine hundred and ninety nine sides. But when I form a relative conception of it, by attending to the relation it bears to polygons of a greater or less number of sides, my notion of it becomes distinct and scientific, and I can demonstrate the properties by which it is distinguished from all other polygons. From these instances it appears, that our relative conceptions of things are not always less distinct, nor less fit materials for accurate reasoning, than those that are direct; and that the contrary may happen in a remarkable degree.\"\n\nReid's Essays on the Active Powers of Man.\nOf Consci-\nousness and\nReflection.\n\nOf active power, since they afford us not any idea in\nthemselves of the power to begin any action either of\nmotion or thought.\" He thinks it evident, however,\n\"that we find in ourselves a power to begin or for-\nbear, continue or end, several actions of our minds and\nmotions of our bodies, barely by a thought or pre-\nference of the mind ordering, or, as it were, command-\ning, the doing or not doing such or such a particular\naction. This power which the mind has thus to order\nthe consideration of any idea, or the forbearing to con-\nsider it, or to prefer the motion of any part of the\nbody to its rest, and vice versa in any particular in-\nstance, is that which we call will. The actual exer-\ncise of that power, by directing any particular action,\nor its forbearance, is that which we call volition or\nwilling.\n\nAccording to Mr Locke, therefore, the only clear\nnotion or idea we have of power, is taken from the\npower which we find in ourselves to give certain motions\nto our bodies, or certain directions to our thoughts;\nand this power in ourselves can be brought into action\nonly by willing or volition. This is exactly our doc-\ntrine; where we have endeavoured to prove, that\nwithout the consciousness of actual energy in ourselves,\nwe never could have acquired any notion at all of\npower from observing the changes which take place\namong external objects. But if this be so, if the power,\nof which alone we know anything, can be brought\ninto action only by willing or volition, and if it ne-\ncessarily implies some degree of understanding, as in\nus it certainly does, it comes to be a question of the\nfirst importance, whether any being which possesses not\nwill and understanding can be possessed of real power,\nor be the efficient cause of any action. This question\nwe feel ourselves compelled to answer in the negative.\nIf we had not will, and that degree of understanding\nwhich will necessarily implies, it is evident that we\ncould exert no power, and consequently could have\nnone: for power that cannot be exerted is no power.\nIt follows also, that the power, of which alone we\ncan have any distinct notion, can be only in beings\nthat have understanding and will. Power to produce\nany effect, implies power not to produce it; and we\ncan conceive no way in which power may be deter-\nmined to one of these rather than the other in a being\nthat has not will. We grow from infancy to man-\nhood; we digest our food, our blood circulates, our\nheart and arteries beat; we are sometimes sick and\nsometimes in health: all these things must be done by\nthe power of some agent, but they are not done by\nour power. And if it be asked how we know this?\nThe answer is, because they are not subject to our will.\nThis is the infallible criterion by which we distinguish\nwhat is our doing from what is not; what is in our\npower from what is not. Human power can be ex-\nerted only by will: and we are unable to conceive any\nactive power to be exerted without will. If, therefore,\nany man affirms that a being may be the efficient cause\nof an action which that being can neither conceive nor\nwill, he speaks a language which we do not under-\nstand. If he has a meaning, he must take the words\npower and efficiency in a sense very different from ours;\nfor the only distinct notion, indeed the only notion\nwhich we can form, of real efficiency, is a relation be-\ntween the cause and the effect similar to that between\nus and our voluntary actions. It seems therefore most\nprobable, that such beings only as have some degree\nof understanding and will can possess active power,\nand that inanimate beings must be merely passive.\nNothing which we perceive without us affords any\ngood ground for ascribing active power to any inani-\nmate being; and we can as little conceive such a being\npossessed of power as we can conceive it capable of feel-\ning pain. On the other hand, every thing which we\ndiscover in our own constitution, leads us to think\nthat active power cannot be exerted without will and\nintelligence: and to affirm that it can, is to affirm\nthat what to us at least is a contradiction in terms.\n\nTo this reasoning, which is Dr Reid's*, and which\nto us appears unanswerable, we have heard it objected,\nthat a man born blind has the same evidence for the\nnon-existence of colour that is here urged for the im-\npossibility of power being exerted without will and\nunderstanding. If the objection had not been made\nby a very acute man, we should have deemed it alto-\ngether unworthy of notice; for between the two cases\nsupposed to be similar there is hardly any analogy. A\nman born blind has no notion whatever of colour. If\nyou describe it to him in the best manner you can,\nand refer it to any of the senses which he possesses;\nif you say that it is the object of feeling, and that by\nfeeling it one may perceive things at the distance of\nmany miles; the blind man has reason to say that you\nare uttering a proposition which he knows with the\nutmost certainty cannot possibly be true. But if you\ntell him that colour is the object of the sense of sight,\na sense which he possesses not; that it has not the least\nresemblance to the objects of the other senses; and\nthat persons endowed with the sense of sight perceive\ncoloured objects at the distance of many miles; the\nblind man cannot know whether what you say be true\nor false, because he has no idea or conception of the\nthings of which you speak. This is not the case with\nrespect to power; for every man who has reflected on\nthe operations of his own mind has a very distinct no-\ntion of power, and knows perfectly, that to the actual\nexertion of the only power which he can conceive, will\nand understanding are necessary. Should it be said\nthat there may be power altogether different from that\nof which we have a distinct conception, we think it\nsufficient to reply, that of a thing which cannot be\nconceived nothing can be either affirmed or denied:\nthat activity exerted without will and understanding\nought not to be called an exertion of power, because\npower is the name already appropriated to the attri-\nbute of a being by which he can do certain things if\nhe wills; that as we can form no notion of a real effi-\ncient cause which has not will and understanding, so\nwe have no reason to believe that such a cause any-\nwhere exists; and to say that power, such as we can\nconceive, may be exerted without will and understand-\ning, is as great an absurdity as to say that there may\nbe velocity without space.\n\nBut if active power, in its proper meaning, requires\na subject endowed with will and intelligence, what\nshall we say of those active powers which philosophers\nteach us to ascribe to matter, the powers of corporeal\nattraction, magnetism, electricity, gravitation, and\nothers? These powers, as they are called, shall be con-\nsidered when we treat of the nature and source of cor-\nporeal\nOf Truth, poreal motion. In the mean time, it is sufficient to observe, that whatever the agents may be in the operations of nature, whatever the manner of their agency or the extent of their power, they depend upon the First Cause, and are all under his control.\n\n**Chap. VII. Of Truth, and the different Sources of Evidence.**\n\n**Sect. I. Of Truth.**\n\nBy pursuing these inquiries in the order which to us appears most natural, we are now led to the contemplation of those faculties of the human mind of which truth is properly the object. But what is truth? This was a famous question among the Greek sophists; which had been too often agitated, and to which so many absurd answers had been given, that it came at last to be doubted by men of the world whether a satisfactory answer could be given, or indeed whether the matter was worthy of investigation. It is well known, that among the ancient philosophers there was a sect called from their principles Sceptics, and from their founder Pyrrhonians, who openly avowed their opinion that truth, like virtue, is nothing but a name; that all things are equally true, or rather equally doubtful; and that it is in vain for man to hope for certainty in any inquiry in which he can be engaged. Such scepticism as this no modern philosopher has professed; but many have had enough of it to make sober men hesitate about defining truth, and even insinuate that of truth no definition can be given. This surely is a mistake. If truth cannot be defined, it still wanders at large and in disguise, and vain must be the pursuit of every man who endeavours to obtain it; he is pursuing he knows not what.\n\nSo obvious and so solid is this reflection, that almost every philosopher of merit who has lately written on the nature of evidence has begun his work, if not with a formal definition, with something at least equivalent to a definition of the object of his pursuit. To repeat all these definitions could serve no other purpose than to swell this article to a disproportioned bulk, and to perplex perhaps the mind of the reader. We shall therefore content ourselves with that which is given by Mr Wollaston. \"Those propositions (says he) are true which represent things as they are: or, truth is the conformity of those words or signs by which things are expressed to the things themselves.\" Notwithstanding the objections of a very learned and acute writer (w), this is the best definition of truth which we have met with in any language. It is con-\n\n(w) Dr Tatham having asked, with a contemptuous air, How imperfect and illogical is the definition of truth given by Wollaston? proceeds, though not to define, to describe or characterize it himself. \"Truth (says he) is of the nature and essence of God, like him incomprehensible in the whole, and ineffable in its sublimer parts. For these and other reasons it cannot admit of an adequate definition. And who, in the beginning of his researches, should presume to define that which, after all his longest and best conducted labours, he can only hope partially, and often imperfectly, to comprehend; and of which an important part can neither be directly expressed nor directly understood? We may indeed esteem ourselves highly favoured by the Author and Finisher of all truth, if, at the end of our researches, we shall be able any way to understand, to define, and to apply, a few particular portions and detachments of it, and to guard them from error and corruption. When upon a solemn occasion the question was put to our Lord by a Roman governor, What is truth? though it was what he fully and perfectly knew, and what he came purposely and professedly to teach, he did not define it. He knew that definition was never the best method of instruction; and that in its common use and application it was seldom the friend of truth. Philosophically viewed, words do not constitute truth; they are only the vocal instruments by which it is communicated, or the written signs by which it is recorded. By an inquirer, therefore, things are to be examined rather than words defined. By a teacher, things are to be conveyed by words in some form or other, which are doubtless to be explained to the understanding, if not sufficiently understood before. But explanation is one thing, and definition quite another. Explanation is the first office of a teacher: Definition, if it be good, is the last of the inquirer, after the truth be found; and is then the most advantageously employed by the teacher, when his previous instructions have prepared him for it. God is a mind, and truth is consequently an attribute of mind. To the sun, declaring at his rising a marvellous instrument, He, by whom all things were made, hath delegated the power of enlightening the material system; whilst he hath referred to himself the office which is more suitable to his nature, of giving light and knowledge, by his eternal truth to the mind of man. But whether he acts through the instrumentality of his creatures, or more immediately from himself, he is uniform and consistent in his operations; so that one part of his divine economy is always illustrative of another. As the sun feeds his light over the material creation to be apprehended by the eye, truth is the light shed down from heaven to be apprehended by the intellect, given to illumine every subject, natural and moral, corporeal and spiritual, so far as they are qualified by their different natures to convey it to the human mind, or rather perhaps so far as the human mind is qualified to receive it from them.\" The Chart and Scale of Truth, vol. i.\n\nThis passage, of which some parts are certainly not remarkable for perspicuity, seems to be descriptive, not of truth in the common acceptation of the word, but of all knowledge human and divine, of which indeed no adequate definition can be given. Truth, as here used, seems to be opposed to ignorance; as used by Mr Wollaston and others, it is opposed to falsehood. In this last sense it may certainly be explained, if not defined; and if the learned lecturer will allow that Mr Wollaston has given a good explanation of the word truth as opposed to falsehood, we shall not quarrel with him or any man about the propriety of an expression. We have called it a definition of truth; because it was so called by the author from whom it is taken.\nAccording to this definition, every proposition which can be expressed or apprehended is necessarily either true or false, whether its truth or falsehood be perceived or not either by him who hears or by him who utters it. All propositions are either affirmative or negative; but before any thing can with certainty be affirmed or denied of another, we must know those things as they are in themselves, as well as the established use of the signs by which they are expressed. He who affirms or denies without this knowledge, speaks at random, and has no distinct meaning.\n\nEvery faculty which we possess is in some way or other an instrument of knowledge; for we know by our senses, by our memory, and by our intellect. Every one of our faculties, therefore, is concerned in the acquisition of truth, and furnishes the mind with the materials of propositions. These propositions are indeed of various kinds; but they are all certainly true or certainly false, though the certainty of the truth or falsehood of every one it is not always in our power to perceive.\n\nWhen a man affirms that red is a quality inherent in a folder's coat, he utters a proposition which every one of the vulgar firmly believes to be true, but which every philosopher knows to be false. This diversity of belief, however, affects not the truth of the proposition itself. All mankind know that it is either true or false, independent of them or their perceptions; and it is easy, by a few optical experiments and by an explanation of terms, to convince them all, that what they have agreed to call red is no quality inherent in external objects, but only a sensation caused by the impulse of certain rays of light reflected from certain objects to the eye of the percipient. The contrariety therefore in this case of vulgar philosophical belief, does not result from any ambiguity in the nature of truth itself, but from the different means of perception which the clown and the philosopher possess.\n\nAgain, Were a man looking at a red and a green object, to affirm that they are both of the same colour, he would affirm what in one sense may be true, what in another is undoubtedly false, and what in a third may be either true or false. If it be his meaning that the two objects give to him the same sensation, he may know with the utmost certainty that what he says is true; if he mean that they affect all mankind precisely as they affect him, he utters what all mankind with the most absolute certainty know to be false; if he mean that the texture of the two bodies (that particular disposition of parts on their surfaces which makes them reflect certain rays of light and absorb others) is exactly similar, so that the one must reflect the very same kind of rays with the other, he utters what all mankind must believe to be false, though still it is possible that what he affirms may be true. This diversity of belief affects not the truth itself. The two objects are what they are by whomsoever perceived, or whether perceived or not; the rays of light reflected by each are what they are, whether they fall upon this, upon that, or upon any eye; and the sensation communicated to this singular man is certainly what he is conscious it is, as those of the rest of mankind are with equal certainty what they are conscious of. This being the case, it is obvious and undeniable, that the organs of sight in this individual of the human race are somehow differently formed from those of other men; and the only question which can occasion a doubt in the mind of the sceptic is, whether his or their eyes be so formed as to represent things falsely? for that by the one or the other things are falsely represented, is as evident as that two contradictory propositions cannot both be true. Now, though, for any thing we know it is certainly possible, as to us it appears not to imply any contradiction, that the eyes of but one man are formed in a manner suitable to their objects, whilst the eyes of all other men are formed to deceive them; yet the contrary is so highly probable, that no man really doubts of it any more than he doubts whether three and two be equal to five.\n\nThis last proposition is indeed said to express a truth why some absolutely certain, whilst the former expresses a truth which is called morally certain: not that there is any difference or degrees of certainty in the nature of truths themselves; the only difference is in our power of perceiving them. That three and two are equal to five, certain.\n\n(x) Dr Beattie, in his elegant essay, has given a definition of truth very different from this, though it is possible that his meaning may be the same with Mr Wollaston's. \"I account that to be truth (says he) which the constitution of our nature determines us to believe; and that to be falsehood which the constitution of our nature determines us to disbelieve.\" But if truth be really immutable, as he teaches or wishes to teach, it must depend upon the nature of things, and not upon the instinctive impulse of any particular constitution. It is always difficult, often impossible, to distinguish between the constitution of our nature, as it came from the hand of God, and the same constitution as it is moulded by arbitrary and capricious associations of our own. A sincere member of the church of Rome certainly believes the doctrine of transubstantiation. How he may do so we have already shown. Were all mankind sincere members of that church, it would be said and thought, \"that the constitution of human nature determines men to believe transubstantiation;\" a doctrine which, though it is rejected by millions, Pere Boffier has laboured hard to reconcile with common sense. Yet it is certain that the same body cannot be in different places at the same time; and that therefore transubstantiation must be false, though believed by all mankind. Our believing anything does not make it true, nor our disbelieving anything make it false. We must, indeed, act according to our belief; but in every instance truth and falsehood would have been what they are, though we had never existed.\nOf Truth, is said to be an absolute truth; because we perceive the whole of it as it is in itself, and are convinced that every intelligence from the highest to the lowest who understands the terms in which it is expressed perceives it as we do: whereas of moral or physical truths, as they are called, we only perceive a part, and may therefore mistake for want of evidence. Thus, in the case of the two objects exhibiting the same colour to one man, whilst they exhibit different colours to all other men, could we see into the objects themselves, and comprehend them immediately with our intellect as we comprehend our own ideas, it might, and no doubt would, appear as palpable a contradiction to say that the particular disposition of the parts on their surfaces, which reflect the rays of light, are the same in both, as it is now to affirm that three and two are not equal to five.\n\nBetween truth and falsehood there is no medium. All truths are in themselves equally certain; and to the Supreme Being, who knows the nature of everything more fully and intimately than we know our own ideas, they all appear equally certain: but yet we may without absurdity speak of probable truth as well as of certain truth, provided always that we make the difference to result, not from the nature of things, but from the power of our understanding, which comprehends the one kind of truth wholly and the other only partially.\n\nThere is another division made of truth into that which is eternal and necessary, and that which is temporary and contingent. Though we do not approve of applying the epithets temporary and eternal to anything but real existences, yet as this manner of speaking has been used by all philosophers, we shall give instances of each kind of truth, and endeavour to ascertain in what the distinction consists. \"The three angles of a plain triangle are equal to two right angles,\" is a proposition expressive of a necessary and eternal truth. \"The world exists,\" is a contingent and temporary truth. Here it is obvious, that if both these propositions be true, there is no distinction between them, so far as mere truth is concerned; for truth admits not of degrees of comparison. It is however said, that the first proposition depends not upon time, or will, or any thing else; and that the Supreme Being himself could not make it false: whereas it is certainly possible, that he who created the world could annihilate it, and thus reduce what is now a truth to an absolute falsehood. This difference between the two propositions is thought a sufficient ground for calling the former a necessary and eternal truth, and the latter a temporary and contingent truth. But is the difference itself real? In the present instance we cannot think that it is: for if the right angles and triangles, which constitute the materials of the former proposition, be real corporeal things, they may be annihilated as well as the rest of the world; and then the truth of the proposition will cease, for there can be neither equality nor inequality between nonentities. If the angles and triangles be merely ideas in the mind of a rational being, it is not to be denied that the proposition must be true, independent of all will, whenever those ideas exist, i.e. whenever right angles and triangles are thought upon; but if all reasonable creatures were to be annihilated, and the Supreme Being never to think of triangles, the proposition would unquestionably cease to be either true or false. The world may indeed be annihilated; but it certainly is not annihilated whilst any one creature exists to contemplate even that which is called necessary and eternal truth: and therefore whilst any truth exists in a mind not divine, it must be necessarily true that the world exists; for the individual being by which truth is perceived would then constitute the whole world.\n\nBut if in a somewhat different manner we compare the former of these propositions with this, \"The solar system consists of the sun and at least seven primary planets,\" we shall at once perceive the difference between necessary and contingent truths. Both propositions we know to be true at this moment: but there is this difference between them, that a plain triangle can neither actually exist at any period of duration, nor be conceived by any one mind divine or human, of which the three internal angles are not precisely equal to two right angles; whereas the solar system may easily be conceived, and might certainly have been formed, with a smaller number of primary planets rolling round the central fire. This needs no proof; as it is well known, that till very lately we conceived the system to consist of the sun and only six primary planets; and it has been already shown, that whatever we can positively conceive may possibly exist. Thus, then, every proposition, of which the contrary is clearly and distinctly perceived to be impossible, is a necessary truth; and it may likewise be said to be eternal, because at every period of duration it must of necessity when thought upon be perceived to be true: On the other hand, every proposition of which the contrary may be clearly and distinctly conceived, is, if true, only a contingent truth, because its contrary might have existed; and it may likewise be called temporary, because what might have been false in time past may yet be false in time future.\n\nThough all our faculties (our senses, our memory, and our intellect), furnish materials for propositions, received by four rational faculties; and are therefore all subservient to the investigation of truth; yet the perception of truth, as it is in itself, is which are commonly ascribed to our rational faculties; and these commonly have by Locke and others been reduced to two\u2014reason and judgement. The former is said to be conversant about certain truths, the latter chiefly about probabilities.\n\nSome late philosophers of great merit, dissatisfied with this analysis of the intellect, have added to reason and judgement a third faculty, to which they have given the name of common sense, and of which the proper object is such truths as neither admit nor stand in need of evidence. By common sense they mean, \"that common degree of judgement which is common to men with whom we can converse and transact business.\" Whether the introduction of such a term into metaphysics was proper or improper, we do not think it of importance to inquire. According to this definition of it, which is Dr Reid's, it differs not from the reason (Y) and judgement of Locke; agreeing with the former when\n\n(Y) This is expressly acknowledged by Dr Reid. \"It is absurd (says that able and candid writer) to conceive\nOf Intuitive Evidence and Demonstration.\n\nIntuitive evidence is that which arises from the comparison of two or more ideas or notions when their agreement or disagreement is perceived immediately, without the intervention of any third idea or notion. Of this kind is the evidence of these propositions: One and four make five; things equal to \"the same thing are equal to one another; the whole is greater than any of its parts;\" and in a word, all the axioms in arithmetic and geometry. All these are in reality propositions in which the subject and predicate appear upon comparison to be nothing more than the same thing taken in different views or expressed by different terms. In fact, they are all in some respect reducible to this axiom, \"Whatever is, is.\" We do not say that they are deduced from it; for they have in themselves that original and intrinsic evidence which makes them, as soon as the terms are understood, to be perceived intuitively. And if they be not thus perceived, no deduction of reason will ever confer on them any additional evidence. But though not deduced from the general axiom, they may be considered as particular exemplifications of it; inasmuch as they are all implied in this, that the properties and relations of our clear and adequate ideas can be no other than what the mind clearly perceives them to be.\n\nIt may perhaps be thought, that if axioms were propositions perfectly identical, it would be impossible by their means to advance a single step beyond the simple a series of ideas first perceived by the mind. And it would indeed be true, that if the predicate of the proposition were nothing but a repetition of the subject under the same aspect, and in the same or synonymous terms, no conceivable advantage could be made of it for the furtherance of knowledge. Of such propositions as these, for instance, \"seven are seven, eight are eight, the three angles of a triangle are the three angles of a triangle, two right angles are two right angles,\" it is manifest that we could never avail ourselves for the improvement of science: But when the thing, though in effect coinciding, is considered under a different aspect; when that which is single in the subject is divided in the predicate, and conversely; or when what is a whole in the one is regarded as a part of something else in the other; such propositions lead to the discovery\n\nconceive that there can be any opposition between reason and common sense. It is indeed the first-born of reason; and as they are commonly joined together in speech and in writing, they are inseparable in their nature. We ascribe to reason two offices or two degrees: the first is to judge of things self-evident; the second to draw conclusions that are not self-evident from those that are. The first of these is the province, and the sole province of common sense; and therefore it coincides with reason in its whole extent, and is only another name for one branch or one degree of reason.\" Pere Buffier talks nearly the same language; but Dr. Beattie expresses himself very differently. \"That there is a real and essential difference between these two faculties; that common sense cannot be accounted for by being called the perfection of reason, nor reason by being resolved into common sense; will appear (he thinks) from the following remarks: 1. We are conscious, from internal feeling, that the energy of understanding, which perceives intuitive truth, is different from that other energy which unites a conclusion with a first principle by a gradual chain of intermediate relations. 2. We cannot discern any necessary connexion between reason and common sense.\" Nay, he says, \"That we often find men endowed with the one who are destitute of the other;\" and he instances dreams and certain kinds of madness where this is the case; adding, that a man who believes himself made of glass, shall yet reason very justly concerning the means of preserving his supposed brittleness from flaws and fractures.\" Surely these are strange remarks. Dreams and madness have hitherto been supposed to originate in the imagination, or, as it was denominated by the ancient philosophers, the phantasia: and when the ideas or forms which are there treasured up are disarranged or absurdly compounded, a dreaming sane man or a waking madman, if he reason at all, must reason from absurd principles: not, however, through any defect of common sense, but from a disorder in that region of the brain, upon which the phantasia more immediately depends. Of his first remark, we can only say, that to us it appears to be the reverse of truth. In every proposition which admits of demonstration, we are conscious that the conclusion is united with the first principle by a repetition of the very same energy of the understanding which perceives intuitive truth. That this is the case in every one of Euclid's demonstrations, we appeal to every mathematical reader; and why it must be so, we shall by and by endeavour to evince.\nOf Intuitive discovery of innumerable and apparently remote relations. It is by the aid of such simple and elementary principles that the arithmetician and the algebraist proceed to the most astonishing discoveries. Nor are the operations of the geometrician essentially different; for to this class belong all propositions relating to number and quantity; that is, all which admit of mathematical demonstration. If the truth of a mathematical proposition be not self-evident; in other words, if the subject and predicate do not appear at first sight to be different names for the same thing, another term must be found that shall be synonymous to both. Thus, to prove that the three internal angles of a right-angled triangle are equal to two right angles, I produce the base of the triangle; and by a very short process I discover that the exterior angle so formed is equal to the two interior and opposite angles. By a process equally plain and short, I perceive that the exterior angle and the interior adjacent angle are equal to two right angles: But I have already seen, that the exterior angle is neither more nor less than the two interior and opposite angles under a different aspect; whence it appears that the three internal angles of the triangle are nothing else than two right angles under a different aspect. In a word, all demonstration is founded on first principles or primary truths, which neither admit nor stand in need of proof, and to which the mind is compelled to give its assent by a bare intuition of the ideas or terms of which these primary truths are composed. Nothing is susceptible of demonstration, in the rigid sense of the word, but general, necessary, and eternal truths; and every demonstration is built upon intuition, and consists in a series of axioms or propositions of the very same kind with the first principle or truth from which the reasoning proceeds. That propositions formerly demonstrated are taken into the series, doth not in the least invalidate this account; inasmuch as these propositions are all resolvable into axioms, and are admitted as links in the chain; not because necessary, but merely to avoid the useless prolixity which frequent and tedious repetitions of proofs formerly given would occasion. But it is obvious that such truths only as result from the comparison of ideas and notions are necessary; and of course that such truths only are capable of strict demonstration. The truths which relate to real existences are all contingent, except that which affirms the existence of the Supreme Being, the Parent of all truth.\n\nThe mathematical sciences, categorical logic, and that part of metaphysics which demonstrates the being of God, are therefore the only branches of human knowledge which admit of strict demonstration. The longest demonstration in the mathematical sciences may be traced to this general and necessary truth, \"Whatever is, is,\" or to some particular exemplification of it: the longest train of categorical syllogisms terminates in this general principle, \"What is affirmed or denied of a whole genus, may be affirmed or denied of all the species and all the individuals belonging to that genus;\" and the metaphysical demonstration of the being of God rests upon this foundation, \"Whatever had a beginning, had a cause.\" That these are truths absolutely certain, which can neither be proved nor called in question, every man may be satisfied, merely by attending to the ideas or notions which the terms of each proposition express. The two first are merely identical propositions, of the truth of which no man has ever pretended to doubt; and though the last is not identical, it is a necessary and felt evident truth, as its contrary implies, that in the same thing there is power and no power, change and no change, action and inaction, at the same instant.\n\nBefore we dismiss the subject of intuition, it may be improper to observe, that it is by this faculty of the mind contemplating its ideas, and comparing one idea with another, that we acquire all our notions of relation; such as identity and diversity, resemblance, coexistence, relations of space and time, relations of quantity and number, of a cause to its effect, and many more which it would be useless as well as tedious to enumerate.\n\nSect. III. Of Experience and Analogy.\n\nIt has been just observed, that intuition and demonstration are applicable only to general and necessary the result of repeated observations, of which the contrary are not only false, but absurd and impossible. The great bulk of life, however, is with facts and contingent truths, which admit not of demonstration, but rest upon other evidence. The senses, external and internal, are the intellects to all our knowledge of facts; and the memory is the storehouse where that knowledge is preserved. Of what a man sees or feels, he can at the instant of seeing or feeling entertain no doubt; and whilst the ideas of what he has seen or felt, with all their associated circumstances, remained vivid and distinct in his memory, he is conscious that he possesses so much real knowledge. But all our knowledge, as it is derived from the senses, is of particular facts or particular truths; and the man who has in certain circumstances observed one particular phenomenon, for the existence of which he perceives no necessity, has not sufficient ground to conclude, that in similar circumstances similar phenomena will always occur. Milton, who surpassed the greater part of his contemporaries in philosophical science almost as far as he has surpassed all succeeding poets in the sublimity of his genius, represents Adam, when first falling asleep, as under apprehensions that he was about to sink into his original state of insensibility:\n\n\"Gentle sleep\nFirst found me, and with soft opprestion seiz'd\nMy drowsy senses, untroubled; though I thought\nI then was passing to my former state\nInseparable, and forthwith to dissolve.\"\n\nApprehensions similar to these would take place in his mind when he first perceived that darkness had overspread the earth. In his circumstances, he could have no ground to expect that the sun when once set would rise again to relume the world, as he had not then experienced the alternate succession of light and darkness, and probably knew not whence light proceeds. After some time, however, having observed day and night regularly to succeed each other, these two appearances, or the ideas of them, would be so associated in his mind, that each setting sun would suggest the idea of next sunrise, and lead him to expect that glorious\nOf experience glorious event with the utmost confidence. He would then consider the alternate succession of day and night as a law of nature, which might be affirmed in a proposition expressive of a certain truth.\n\nThis continued observation of the same event happening in the same or similar circumstances, is what we call experience; and it is the only evidence which we have for all the general truths in physics, even for those which we are apt to think intuitively certain. Thus, that milk is white, and that gold is yellow, are supposed to be universal and necessary truths: but for any thing that we know, they may be particular truths; and they are certainly contingent, as the contrary to either of them may be supposed without absurdity. We have indeed always observed the milk of animals of every species white; and therefore the idea of white becomes a necessary part of our idea of the substance milk, of which we call whiteness an essential property. This, however, respects only the milk of those animals with which we are acquainted. But since the milk of all the animals with which we are acquainted, or of which we have heard, is white, we can have no reason to suspect that the milk of any new and strange animal is of any other colour. Also, since, wherever there has been the specific gravity, ductility, and other properties of gold, the colour has always been yellow; we conclude that these circumstances are necessarily united, though by some unknown bond of union, and that they will always go together.\n\nThe proper proof, therefore, of such universal propositions as \"that milk is white,\" \"that gold is yellow,\" or, \"that a certain degree of cold will freeze water,\" consists in what is called an induction of particular facts of precisely the same nature. Having found, by much and various experience, that the same events never fail to take place in the same circumstances, the expectation of the same consequences from the same previous circumstances is necessarily generated in our minds; and we can have no more suspicion of a different event than we can separate the idea of whiteness from that of the other properties of milk. When the previous circumstances are precisely the same, we call the process of proof by the name of induction, and expect the event from experience: but if they be not precisely the same, but only bear a considerable resemblance to the circumstances from which any particular appearance has been found to result, we call the argument analogy; and it is stronger in proportion to the degree of resemblance in the previous circumstances. Thus the milk of all the cows that we have seen, or upon which we have made the experiment, having been found nourishing, we confidently expect that the milk of all other cows will prove nourishing likewise; and this confidence of expectation is the result of uniform experience. But if, from having found the milk of all the animals with which we are acquainted to be nourishing, however different the nature of these animals; we infer that the milk of any strange animal will likewise be nourishing; the inference is drawn by analogy, and by no means carries with it the conviction of experience. A proof from real experience can leave no doubt in the mind (z); an argument from analogy always must. In the one case, we only infer that two events of precisely the same nature, and in precisely the same circumstances, have been produced by the same kind of cause; in the other, we infer that two events similar in most respects, though for any thing that we know dissimilar in others, have been produced by the same kind of cause; and it is obvious that between these cases the difference is great.\n\nThus, after having observed that all the projectiles to which we have paid any attention\u2014a stone thrown from the hand, a ball from a gun, and an arrow from a bow\u2014describe a certain curve, and are impelled in that curve by two powers acting in different lines of direction which form with each other a certain angle, we infer that all projectiles which on the surface of the earth describe the same curve are impelled by the same or similar powers acting in the same or similar lines of direction. This inference is the result of experience, and carries with it the fullest conviction to the mind. But when, from having observed that the curves described by the planets are of the same kind with those described by projectiles on the earth, Sir Isaac Newton inferred that these vast bodies are impelled in their orbits by forces of the very same kind, and acting in the same manner with the forces which impel a ball from a cannon or an arrow from a bow, his argument was founded only on analogy; and even that\n\n(z) We say from real experience; because what is often taken for experience, and to human eyes has that appearance, is in fact nothing more than analogy. Thus a physician may have prescribed to ninety-nine patients labouring under the same disease the same remedy, and always with the same success. If so, he will think that he has experience of its utility, and will prescribe it again with the fullest confidence. Yet in this case he may be disappointed; for though the medicine be the same and the disease the same, there may be something in the constitution of the hundredth patient so different from that of the ninety-nine, that what was salutary to them may be pernicious to him. This does not detract from the evidence of experience; it only shows, that the circumstances of the case in which the medicine failed were different from those in which it succeeded. In such conclusions as are founded on a complete induction and uniform experience, every man expects the event with the last degree of assurance, and regards his past experience as a full proof of the future existence of that event: in other cases, where experience has been variable\u2014or apparently variable\u2014he knows that the induction has been incomplete, and therefore proceeds with caution. He weighs the opposite experiments; takes as complete a view as he can of the circumstances in which they were made; considers which side is supported by the greater number of experiments, and inclines to that side with doubt and hesitation. And when at last he fixes his judgement, the evidence exceeds not what is called probability. All probability, then, supposes an opposition of experiments and observations, where the one side is found to overbalance the other, and to produce a degree of evidence proportioned to the superiority.\nthat analogy is very remote. We know by experience that all projectiles which fall under our immediate cognizance are of the very same kind and in the very same circumstances; that every one of them has a tendency, from whatever cause, to the centre of the earth, and is preserved from falling by the force of projection; we know likewise that they are all moved through the medium of the atmosphere, which at the surface of the earth is considerably dense, and that a dense medium must occasion much resistance: But we do not know that the planets have a tendency to the centre of the sun, that they are preserved from falling into that luminary by a projectile force, or whether they move through a medium or in vacuo; so that we are not certain that the motion of the planets is perfectly similar to that of terrestrial projectiles in any other circumstance than the form of the curve which they all describe; and from this single case of coincidence no inference can be drawn which carries to the mind absolute conviction.\n\nWhen a man reasons from experience, he infers, that what has uniformly happened hitherto, will happen always in the very same circumstances; or that what is known to be the cause of various phenomena of the same kind is the cause of every other phenomenon in all respects similar to these. Such an inference is founded on the united and complete evidence of sense, memory, and reason. When a man reasons from analogy he infers, that what has generally happened hitherto, will happen again in circumstances nearly similar; or that what is known to be the cause of various phenomena of the same kind, is the cause of other phenomena in some respects similar to these. This inference is likewise founded on the united evidence of sense, memory, and reason: but here the evidence of sense is not complete, and it can be strengthened only by finding more facts of the same or of a similar nature.\n\nSect. IV. Of Testimony.\n\nThe last source of evidence which we propose to consider is testimony, or the report of men concerning events which have fallen under the observation of their senses. That we are all ready to believe the information which we receive from the testimony of our fellow creatures is undeniable; and indeed without such belief every man's knowledge of facts and events would be confined to those only of which he himself had been a personal witness. In that case, no man who had not travelled would believe that there are such cities as Rome and Constantinople; and no man whatever could now believe that such heroes as Hannibal and Caesar had ever existed.\n\nBetween words and things there is no natural connexion; and though we are all accustomed to give to things the names by which they are known in the language that we speak, and to express their mutual relations by the words appropriated for that purpose; yet it is obviously impossible to denote one thing by the name of another, and to express by words relations that have no existence. This being the case, it may be asked upon what principle we give credit to human testimony? To this question various answers have been given, which have produced much controversy on one of the most important subjects which can employ the mind of man.\n\n\"We may observe (says Mr Hume*), that there is no species of reasoning more common, more useful, and affixed by even necessary to human life, than that which is derived from the testimony of men and the reports of eyewitnesses and spectators. This species of reasoning perhaps one may deny to be founded on the relation of cause and effect. I shall not dispute about a word. It will be sufficient to observe, that our assurance in any argument of this kind is derived from no other principle than our observation of the veracity of human testimony, and of the usual conformity of facts to the reports of witnesses. It being a general maxim that no objects have any discoverable connexion together, and that all the inferences which we can draw from one to another are founded merely on our experience of their constant and regular conjunction; it is evident that we ought not to make an exception to this maxim in favour of human testimony, whose connexion with any event seems in itself as little necessary as any other. Were not the memory tenacious to a certain degree; had not men commonly an inclination to truth, and a principle of probity; were they not sensible to shame when detected in falsehood: Were not these, I say, discovered by experience to be qualities inherent in human nature, we should never repose the least confidence in human testimony. And as the evidence derived from witnesses and human testimony is founded on past experience, so it varies with the experience, and is regarded either as a proof or probability, according as the conjunction between any particular kind of report and any kind of object has been found to be constant or variable. There are a number of circumstances to be taken into consideration in all judgements of this kind; and the ultimate standard by which we determine all disputes that may arise concerning them, is always derived from experience and observation. The reason why we place any credit in witnesses and historians, is not derived from any connexion which we perceive a priori between testimony and reality, but because we are accustomed to find a conformity between them. But when the fact attested is such a one as has seldom fallen under our observation, here is a contest of two opposite experiences; of which the one destroys the other as far as it goes, and the superior can only operate on the mind by the force which remains. The very same principle of experience which gives us a certain degree of assurance in the testimony of witnesses, gives us also, in this case, another degree of assurance against the fact which they endeavour to establish; from which contradiction there necessarily arises a counterpoise, and mutual destruction of belief and authority.\"\n\nThis account of the origin of faith in testimony has confused, been and\n\n(A) Is there then no discoverable connexion between a tree and the field in which it grows; between a man and his clothes; between an author and his work; between a sceptic and paradoxes? Surely all these are correlates, and necessarily suggest the ideas of each other.\nbeen controverted with much success by the Doctors Campbell and Reid. \"That the evidence of testimony is derived solely from experience (says the former of these writers *), is at least not so incontestable a truth as Mr Hume supposes it; that, on the contrary, testimony hath a natural and original influence on belief antecedent to experience, will, I imagine, easily be conceived. For this purpose, let it be remarked, that the earliest afflent which is given to testimony by children, and which is previous to all experience, is, in fact, the most unlimited; that by a gradual experience of mankind, it is gradually contracted, and reduced to narrower bounds. To say, therefore, that our diffidence in testimony is the result of experience, is more philosophical, because more consonant to truth, than to say that our faith in testimony has this foundation. Accordingly, youth, which is unexperienced, is credulous; age, on the contrary, is distrustful. Exactly the reverse would be the case were this author's doctrine just.\"\n\nThis is a complete confutation of the reasoning of Mr Hume: but in order to prevent all cavilling, it is to be wished that the very acute author had explained more fully what he means by saying, that testimony hath a natural and original influence on belief; for these words may be taken in different senses, in one of which what he affirms is true, and in another false.\n\nDr Campbell's omission is amply supplied by Dr Reid, who gives the following account of testimony, and of the credit which it obtains. \"The wise and benevolent Author of nature, who intended that we should be social creatures, and that we should receive the greatest and most important part of our knowledge by the information of others, hath, for these purposes, implanted in our nature two principles that tally with each other. The first of these principles is a propensity to speak truth, and to use the signs of language so as to convey our real sentiments. This principle has a powerful operation even in the greatest liars; for where they lie once, they speak truth a hundred times. Truth is always uppermost, and is the natural issue of the mind. It requires no art or training, no inducement or temptation, but only that we yield to a natural impulse. Lying, on the contrary, is doing violence to our nature, and is never practised even by the worst men without some temptation. Speaking truth is like using our natural food, which we would do from appetite, although it answered no end; but lying is like taking physic, which is nauseous to the taste, and which no man takes but for some end which he cannot otherwise attain.\u2014When we are influenced by any motive, we must be conscious of that influence, and capable of perceiving it upon reflection. Now, when I reflect upon my actions most attentively, I am not conscious that in speaking truth I am influenced on ordinary occasions by any motive moral or political. I find that truth is always at the door of my lips, and goes forth spontaneously if not held back. It requires neither good nor bad intention to bring it forth, but only that I be artless and undefining. There may indeed be temptations to falsehood, which would be too strong for the natural principle of veracity, unaided by principles of honour or virtue; but where there is no such temptation, we speak truth by instinct. By this instinct, a real connexion is formed between our words and our thoughts; and thereby the former become fit to be signs of the latter, which they could not otherwise be.\"\n\nSuch is the account which Dr Reid gives of the truth of human testimony: and he adds, that there is another original principle implanted in us by the Supreme Being, to tally with it, viz. a disposition to confide in the veracity of others, and to believe what they tell us. \"This (he says) is the counterpart to the former; and as that may be called the principle of veracity, we shall, for the want of a more proper name, call this the principle of credulity. It is unlimited in children, until they meet with instances of deceit and falsehood; and retains a very considerable degree of strength through life.\"\n\nIt is ever with extreme reluctance that we contradict the opinions of this able writer; and that reluctance cannot be lessened in the present instance, when we are conscious that great part of what he says is unanswerable. That truth is always at the door of the lips; that it requires no effort to bring it forth; that in ordinary cases men speak truth uninfluenced by any motive moral or political; that the greatest liars speak truth a hundred times where they lie once; and that lying is never practised by the worst men without some temptation, are positions which daily experience renders it impossible to question: But notwithstanding this, we do not think that truth is spoken by an instinctive principle; because it is inconceivable that instinct should teach the use of arbitrary and artificial signs, such as the words of every language undoubtedly are; or that between such signs and ideas any instinctive connexion should ever be formed. \"Truth (as we have defined it) is the conformity of those words or signs by which things are expressed to the things themselves;\" and things themselves are what they are, independent of us, our instincts, and perceptions. When we have precise and adequate ideas of objects, and when those ideas are related to one another as the objects themselves are related, we are in possession of mental truth; and in this case there is a real and natural connexion between the signs and the things signified: for we cannot frame original and simple ideas which have no archetype in nature; nor can one object, distinctly perceived, generate in our minds the ideas that are generated by other objects. Here external things are the objects, and ideas are the signs, which, when they are in conformity to the things signified by them, constitute truth.\n\nBut in human testimony, the ideas in the mind of the speaker are the things signified, and the words of reason and language are signs by which they are expressed; and since when these things and signs are in conformity to each other, the words uttered express so much truth.\u2014Now, though in this case there is no natural connexion between the sign and the thing signified, yet it is obvious, that without a violent effort of the speaker to the contrary they must always be in conformity with each other; because, in every language, there are words appropriated for the purpose of denoting every idea and relation\u2014which can be expressed; and in the mind of every man these ideas, relations, and words, have been constantly associated from the time that he learned to speak. So intimate is this association, and so impossible to be broken, that whoever will pay sufficient attention\nChap. VII.\n\nOf Testimony.\n\nto the operations of his own mind, will find that he thinks as well as speaks in some language; and that in cogitation he supposes and runs over, silently and habitually, those sounds which in speaking he actually utters (n). If this be so, it is impossible that a man without some effort should ever speak any thing but truth: for the ideas of what he has seen or heard, &c., are not of his manufacture; they are generated by external objects; and till they be effaced from the memory, they must always, by the law of association, make their appearance there with all their mutual relations, and in their proper drefs. In the very act of learning to speak, we necessarily learn to speak the truth: for were we not to employ words exactly as they are employed by those with whom we converse, our language (if language it might be called) would be unintelligible; and we could neither declare our wants nor ask relief with any hopes of success. Children beginning to speak, may indeed utter untruths without any motive, and merely from mistake; because the ideas and words of children have neither been long nor closely associated: but it is impossible that a man, however wicked, should habitually and without motives lie on ordinary occasions, unless the fundamental principles of his nature have been totally altered; unless his brain has been disordered by disease; unless his ideas have been disarranged, and all his original associations broken.\n\nWe know indeed by woful experience, that immoral men occasionally utter falsehoods with a view to deceive. But on these occasions they are influenced by some motive either of hope or terror: the falsehood is always uttered with an effort: and so strong is the association between words and ideas, that the truth will at times break out in spite of all their endeavours to suppress it; so that the end or middle of a false narrative, if it be of any length, is commonly inconsistent with the beginning. We entertain a suspicion concerning any matter of fact, when those who relate it contradict each other\u2014when they are but few in number, or of doubtful character\u2014when they have an interest in what they affirm\u2014when they deliver their testimony with hesitation\u2014or, on the contrary, with too violent affections; because these are circumstances which we have generally experienced to accompany false witness. It is likewise with reluctance that we admit a narrative of events entirely different from every thing which hitherto we have seen or heard; because we may not be certain that the narrator is not under some influence to deceive us in matters concerning which we have nothing but his testimony on which to ground our judgement. But in every case where the fact recorded is in itself possible, and attributed to an adequate cause; where a competent (c) number of witnesses had sufficient means of information, and are certainly under no inducement to deceive; testimony is complete evidence, however extraordinary the fact may be; because no fact which is known to have an adequate cause can be so incredible, as that a number of men of sound understandings should act contrary to the fundamental principles of human nature, or be able, if so disposed, to dissolve associations which had been formed in the mind of each from his infancy, and form new ones, all agreeing exactly with one another, but all contrary to truth.\n\nPART II. OF BODY WITH ITS ADJUNCTS.\n\nCHAP. I. Of the Composition of Bodies; or, of Matter and Form.\n\nHITHERTO we have contemplated only the powers of our minds by which we acquire a stock of ideas, and the various operations of the intellect upon those ideas, as treasured up in the memory or imagination. In the course of the inquiry we have found, that every idea and notion which we have was suggested by something independent of us; and in order to discover what those things are, we have investigated the nature of each sense, as it is by the senses only that we have any communication with the external world. By touch we perceive heat and cold, hardness and softness, figure, solidity, motion, and extension; by the organ of smell, we perceive odours; by the tongue and palate, tastes; by the ear, sounds; and by the sight, colours. We have likewise seen, that heat and cold, odours, tastes, sounds, and colours, are mere sensations which have no existence but while they are perceived. On the other hand, hardness and softness, figure and solidity, motion and extension, are neither sensations, nor like sensations; but are conceived to be something eternal.\n\n(n) This seems to have been Plato's opinion; for he calls thinking \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u03bd \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u1f22 \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03b1 \u1f22 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u1f22 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2, \"the language by which the soul explains itself to itself when it considers anything.\" And Plotinus says, \u03bf\u03bd \u03a6\u03c9\u03bd\u03b7 \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b9\u03bc\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2, \"the vocal words are an imitation of those of the soul.\" To say that vocal words are an imitation of those of the soul, is to speak inaccurately, and to reverse the process of association; but it affords sufficient evidence, that in the opinion of Plotinus men think as well as speak in words.\n\n(c) Should it be asked what number we call competent, we beg leave to say, that it will be greater or less according to circumstances. In cases where they are not liable to the deceptions of sense, two men of integrity and intelligence deserve equal credit with two thousand; but where there is particular occasion for good organs, whether of sight, hearing, or touch, the greater the number the greater is our security. To this must be added, that as one man is influenced by that which to another would be no motive, a great number of witnesses concurring in the same testimony is always an additional security that they are not under the influence of any latent bias.\nOf things perceived by the senses we find the greater part always united; for when a man perceives a piece of sealing wax, if he makes use of all his senses, he perceives at once cold, taste, colour, hardness, roughness or smoothness, figure, solidity, motion or rest, and extension. That the powers or qualities, which in this instance produce the sensations of heat or cold, taste, odour, and colour, are so united to the hardness, figure, solidity, and extension of the wax, as that they cannot exist alone, is evident; because it is impossible to remove any one of these things, or to conceive it removed, without removing with it all the rest. What then is the bond of this union? Do these things necessarily accompany one another, so that one of them cannot exist without bringing all the rest along with it? No; there is no necessary connexion among them; for by the operation of fire the wax may be rendered liquid, when the hardness and cold are gone, though every thing else remains the same, or nearly the same, as it was before. By a still further operation of fire the appearance may be entirely changed; and that which was formerly a piece of hard red wax, may be reduced to smoke and ashes, in which there is neither hardness, colour, odour, nor figure; at least there is not in the smoke and ashes such hardness, colour, odour, or figure, as was in the wax. The solidity and extension, however, remain; for we perceive ashes and smoke to be extended and solid as much as wax or an adamant; nor is it possible to do anything with the wax, or with any other sensible object, which shall deprive it of extension or solidity.\n\nThus, then, extension and solidity may exist and be perceived when separated from hardness, colour, and odour; but none of these can exist, or be conceived to exist, independent of extension and solidity. Hardness, colour, odour, taste, and figure, or the things which suggest these notions to us, have with great propriety been termed accidents or qualities; because they cannot exist or be conceived to exist by themselves, but require for their support one common subject. Extension and solidity can exist independent of them, but they cannot exist independent of solidity and extension.\n\nIs then solidity the basis of these qualities, so that they necessarily result from it? No; there are many things solid and extended which are neither hard, nor coloured, nor odorous, nor rapid; which could not be if these qualities were the necessary effect of solidity. Besides, all mankind conceive of solidity and extension as qualities of something else; for we never say that solidity is extended or coloured, or hard or odorous, but that something solid has these qualities: whence it is evident that we consider solidity as a quality itself. In what then does solidity and all the other sensible qualities inheres, since they cannot exist separately, and do not support each other? This is the question which modern philosophers pretend not to answer; but some of the ancients were not so modest. Aristotle and his followers resolved every bodily substance into matter and form, making matter the basis or substratum, and under form comprehending all sensible qualities.\n\nAs attempts have been lately made to revive this philosophy, it may not be improper to give a short view of the doctrine of matter and form, if it were only to discover whether the speculations of Aristotle and his adherents on this subject deserve to be preferred to those of Newton and Locke.\n\nThe most perspicuous, and by far the most elegant writer among the moderns who has adopted the ancient philosophy, is Mr Harris; and lest we should be accused by others of doing injustice to a subject above the reach of ordinary comprehension, we shall transcribe so much of what he has said of matter and form in his Philosophical Arrangements as seems necessary to make our readers understand his meaning as far as it is intelligible.\n\n\"Matter (says this writer) is that elementary constituent in composite substances which pertains in common to them all, without distinguishing them from one another. Every thing generated or made, whether by nature or art, is generated or made out of something else; and this something else is called its subject or matter. Such is iron to the saw; such is timber to the boat. Now this subject or matter of a thing being necessarily previous to that thing's existence, is necessarily different from it, and not the same. Thus iron, as iron, is not a saw; and timber, as timber, is not a boat. Hence, then, one character of every subject or matter, that is, the character of negation or privation. [He means negation or privation of what is to be made out of it.]\n\n\"Again, Though the subject or matter of a thing be which is not that thing, yet, were it incapable of becoming described so, it could not be called its subject or matter. Thus as defuncte iron is the subject or matter of a saw; because, though attribute or not a saw, it may still become a saw. On the contrary, quality, timber is not the subject or matter of a saw; because it not only (as timber) is no saw, but can never be made one from its very nature and properties. Hence, then, besides privation, another character of every subject or matter, and that is the character of aptitude or capacity. [He means aptitude or capacity to be that which is made out of it.]\n\n\"Again, When one thing is the subject or matter of many things, it implies a privation of them all, and a capacity to them all. Thus iron being the subject or matter of the saw, the axe, and the chisel, implies privation and capacity with respect to all three. Again, We can change a saw into a chisel, but not into a boat; we can change a boat into a box, but not into a saw. The reason is, there can be no change or mutation of one thing into another where the two changing beings do not participate the same matter (D). But even here, were the boat to moulder and turn to earth,\n\n(D) In a note he says: This reasoning has reference to what the ancients called \u1f51\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03c7\u03b9\u03c2, the immediate matter, in opposition to \u1f51\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03c9\u03bd, the remote or primary matter.\nearth, and that earth by natural process to metallize and become iron; through such progression as this we might suppose even the boat to become a saw. Hence therefore it is, that all change is by immediate or immediate participation of the same matter. Having advanced thus far, we must be careful to remember, first, that every subject or matter implies, as such, privation and capacity; and next, that all change or mutation of beings into one another is by means of their participating the same common matter. This we have chosen to illustrate from works of art, as falling more easily under human cognizance and observation. It is, however, no less certain as to the productions of nature, though the superior subtlety in these renders examples more difficult. The question then is, whether in the world which we inhabit, it be not admitted from experience, as well as from the confession of all philosophers, that substances of every kind (E), whether natural or artificial, either immediately or mediately, pass into one another: and whether, in that case, there must not be some one primary matter common to all things. I say some one primary matter, and that common to all things, since without some such matter, such mutation would be wholly impossible. But if there be some one primary matter, and that common to all things, this matter must imply, not (as particular and subordinate matters do) a particular privation and a particular capacity, but, on the contrary, universal privation and universal capacity. If the notion of such a being appear strange and incomprehensible, we may farther prove the necessity of its existence from the following considerations: Either there is no such general change as here spoken of; which is contrary to fact, and would destroy the sympathy and congeniality of things: Or, if there be, there must be a matter of the character here established; because without it (as we have said) such change would be impossible. Add to this, however hard universal privation may appear, yet had the primary matter, in its proper nature, any one particular attribute, so as to prevent its privation from being unlimited and universal, such attribute would run through all things, and be conspicuous in all. If it were white, all things would be white; if circular, they would be circular; and so to other attributes; which is contrary to fact. Add to this, that the opposite to such attribute could never have existence, unless it were possible for the same thing to be at once and in the same instance both white and black, circular and rectilinear, &c. Since this inseparable attribute would necessarily be everywhere; because the matter, which implies it, is itself everywhere, at least may be found in all things that are generated and perishable.\n\nHere then we have an idea (such as it is) of that singular being \u1f41\u03c0\u1f78\u03bd \u1f10\u03be\u03b5\u03bb\u03b8\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd, the primary matter; a being which those philosophers who are immersed in sensible objects know not well how to admit, though they cannot well do without it; a being which flies the perception of every sense, and which is at best, even to the intellect, but a negative object, no otherwise comprehensible than either by analogy or abstraction. We gain a glimpse of it by abstraction, when we say that the first manner is not the lineaments and complexion which make the beautiful face; nor yet the flesh and blood which make those lineaments and that complexion; nor yet the liquid and solid aliment which make that flesh and blood; nor yet the simple bodies of earth and water which make those various aliments; but something, which being below all these, and supporting them all, is yet different from them all, and essential to their existence. We obtain a sight of it by analogy, when we say, that as is the brail to the statue, the marble to the pillar, the timber to the ship, or any one secondary matter to any one peculiar form; so is the first and original matter to all forms in general.\n\nSuch is the doctrine of the Peripatetics concerning the primary matter or the basis of bodily substances. We forbear to make any remarks upon it till we have seen what they say of form, the other essential part of every body; for what is meant by matter and form will be most completely seen when they are viewed together.\n\n\"Form (says the same elegant writer) is that ele-mental constituent in every composite substance, by which it is distinguished, characterized, and known, from every other. But to be more explicit: The first and form, most simple of all extensions is a line: this, when it exists, united with a second extension, makes a superficies; and these two existing together with a third, make a solid. Now this last and complete extension we call the first and simplest form; and when this first and simplest form accedes to the first and simplest matter, the union of the two produces body; which is for that reason defined to be matter triply extended. And thus we behold the rise of pure and original body (F). It must be remembered, however, that body, under this character, is something indefinite and vague, and scarcely to be made an object of scientific contemplation. It is necessary to this end that its extension should be bounded; for as yet we have treated it without such regard. Now, the bound or limit of simple body is figure; and thus it is that figure, with regard to body, becomes the next form after extension.\n\nBut though the boundary of body by figure is one step towards rendering it definite and knowable, yet it is not this sufficient for the purposes of nature. It is necessary here, that not only its external should be duly bounded, but that a suitable regard should likewise be had to its internal. This internal adjustment, disposition, or arrangement (denominate it as you please), is called physical organization, and may be considered as the third form which appertains to body. By its accession we behold the rise of body physical or natural; for every such body is some way or other organized. And thus may we affirm, that these three, that is to say,\n\n(E) He must mean only bodily substances; for it is not admitted by such philosophers as make a distinction between mind and body, that the one ever passes into the other.\n\n(F) \"Original body (he says), when we look downward, has reference to the primary matter, its substratum: when we look upward, it becomes itself a matter to other things; to the elements, as commonly called, air, earth, water, &c. and in consequence to all the variety of natural productions,\"\nextension, figure, and organization, are the three original forms to body physical or natural; figure having respect to its external, organization to its internal, and extension being common both to one and to the other. It is more than probable, that from the variation in these universal and (as I may say) primary forms, arise most of those secondary forms usually called quantities sensible, because they are the proper objects of our several sensations. Such are roughnesses and smoothnesses, hardnesses and softnesses; the tribes of colours, flavours, odours; not to mention those powers of character more subtle, the powers electric, magnetic (G), medicinal, &c.\n\nHere therefore we may answer the question, how natural bodies are distinguished. Not a single one among them consists of materials in chaos, but of materials wrought up after the most exquisite manner, and that conspicuous in their organization, or in their figure, or in both.\u2014As therefore every natural body is distinguished by the differences just described, and as these differences have nothing to do with the original matter, which being everywhere similar can afford no distinction at all; may we not here infer the expediency of essential forms, that every natural substance may be essentially characterized? These forms, though they differ from matter, can yet never subsist without it; but united with it, they help to produce every composite being, that is to say, in other words, every natural substance, in the visible world. It must be remembered, however, that it is the form in this union which is the source of all distinction. It is by this that the ox is distinguished from the horse, not by that graft on which they subsist, the common matter to both... To which also may be added, that as figures and sensible qualities are the only objects of our sensations, and there are all parts of natural form; so therefore (contrary to the sentiment of the vulgar, who dream of nothing but of matter) it is form, which is in truth the whole that we either hear, see, or feel; nor is mere matter anything better than an obscure imperfect being, knowable only to the reasoning faculty by the two methods already explained, I mean that of analogy and that of abstraction. Here therefore we conclude with respect to sensible forms, that is to say, forms immersed in matter and ever inseparable from it. In these and matter we place the ELEMENTS OF NATURAL SUBSTANCE.\n\n(G) That it is from the extension, figure, and organization of bodies, that their medicinal powers arise, seems to be undeniable; for medicines operate by contact: but it is not so clear that the same forms, to use the author's language, are the source of magnetic powers. If the magnet be surrounded with an atmosphere extending to a certain distance, such may be the case; but if not, the author's conjecture must be ill founded. See MAGNETISM.\n\n(H) Nor does it appear that it was divested of them by all the ancient philosophers. We learn from Cudworth, that \"the atomical physiology, the most ancient perhaps of any, teaches that body is nothing else but extended bulk; and that nothing is to be attributed to it but what is included in the nature and idea of it, viz. greater or less magnitude, with divisibility into parts, figure, and position, together with motion or rest, but so as that no part of body can ever move itself. And consequently, this philosophy supposes, that there is no need of any thing else besides the simple elements of magnitude, figure, site, and motion, (which are all clearly intelligible, or different modes of extended substance), to solve the corporeal phenomena by; and therefore not of any substantial forms distinct from the matter; nor of any other qualities really existing in the bodies without, besides the results or aggregates of those simple elements, and the disposition of the insensible parts of bodies in respect of figure, site, and motion; nor of any intentional species or ideas propagated from the objects to our senses; nor, lastly, of any other kind of motion or action really distinct from\nexpressions as if they considered matter to be place; but place, as will be seen afterwards, can be the basis of nothing. He likewise quotes a passage from Ammonius on the predicaments, in which it is said \"that there never was in actuality either matter without body, or body without quality; and we appeal to our readers if it be not absolutely impossible to contemplate such a being even in idea. To the question, Whether the first matter has a separate existence by itself, distinct from all the qualities of body, the author of Ancient Metaphysics answers thus:\u2014\u201cWe have no idea of it existing separately, because we find no such thing in nature, from which we draw all our ideas; but whether there may not be such a thing existing in the regions of infinite space, as matter without form and dimensions; is what I think no man can take upon him to decide.\u201d But with all submission, if a man cannot decide this question with utmost certainty, his three ponderous volumes are nothing better than useless paper: for the subject of them is things existing; and concerning existence we know nothing with greater certainty, than that a being of which nothing positive can be affirmed, cannot possibly have any existence.\n\nThat, in the world which we inhabit, bodily substances of every kind, whether natural or artificial, either immediately or mediately pass into one another, is a truth which cannot be denied: and therefore it follows, that there must be some one primary matter common to all things. In modern philosophy this primary matter is considered as solid, and as the substratum of all bodies; and all those things which, in the language of Mr Harris, are comprehended under the appellation of form, are called qualities: so that on this subject the ancient and modern philosophy differ in nothing but in the latter using the word qualities instead of the word form; and defining the first matter to be, a solid substance everywhere the same,\u201d whilst the ancient philosophy considers it as void of solidity.\n\nOf the nature of this first matter all philosophers are of the equally ignorant: for, as Mr Harris says, it is in truth form; or, as modern philosophers would say, they are men all in truth qualities, which are the whole that we either hear, or see or feel, or of which we have either idea or notion. Mr Locke says expressly, \u201cthat if any one will examine himself concerning his notion of pure substance in general, he will find that he has no other idea of it at all, but only a supposition of he knows not what import of such qualities as are capable of producing simple ideas in us.\u201d\n\nBut how, it has been asked, do we know that the things which we perceive are qualities, and cannot exist without a subject? We answer, Because every one of immediate them, except solidity, may be changed or destroyed, perceived and the subject in which they inheres still remain. Thus, though wax may be melted or burnt, and be no longer a hard red substance of such a figure and such a smell, the matter which supported the hardness, figure, colour, and smell, still remains; for melted wax or ashes is as much a solid substance as is that which may be used for the sealing of letters, &c.\n\nIt has been said that solidity (1) is the substratum of body;\n\nfrom local motion (such as generation and alteration), they being neither intelligible as modes of extended substance, nor any way necessary: Forasmuch as the forms and qualities of bodies may well be conceived to be nothing but the result of those simple elements of magnitude, figure, size, and motion, variously compounded together; in the same manner as syllables and words in great variety result from the different combinations and conjunctions of a few letters, or the simple elements of speech; and the corporeal parts of sensation, and particularly that of vision, may be solved only by local motion of bodies, that is, either by corporeal effluvia (called simulacra, membranes, and exuviae), streaming continually from the surface of the objects, or rather, as the later and more refined atomists conceived, by pressure made from the object to the eye, by means of light in the medium. So that \u1f41\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f30\u03ce\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03ad\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, the sense taking cognizance of the object by the subtle interposed medium, that is tense and stretched (thrusting every way from it upon the optic nerves), both by that, as it were by a staff, touch it. Again, Generation and corruption may be sufficiently explained by concretion and secretion, or local motion, without substantial forms and qualities. And lastly, Those sensible ideas of light and colours, heat and cold, sweet and bitter, as they are distinct things from the figure, size, and motion of the insensible parts of bodies, seem plainly to be nothing else but our own fancies, passions, and sensations, however they be vulgarly mistaken for qualities in the bodies without us.\n\nCudworth's Intellectual System, Book i. chap. i.\n\nThis, as will be seen by and by, is the philosophy of Newton, Locke, and all their followers: and that it is the genuine philosophy of the ancient atomists, we may safely take the word of the author whom we have quoted; for no modern has been more conversant with their writings, more completely master of their language, or has given their sense with greater accuracy. Those authors, therefore, who in their zeal for ancient metaphysics would explode the physiology of Newton and Locke, and substitute in its place the Aristotelian doctrine of matter and form, believe their own pretences; for the theory which they would banish is more ancient than that which they introduce; and we appeal to our readers if it be not more intelligible.\n\n(1) The philosophers of most eminence who have maintained this opinion are, Dr Watts; the author of the Procedure, Extent, and Limits, of the Human Understanding; and Dr Law, late bishop of Carlisle, who in a note upon King's Origin of Evil gives the opinion of the triumvirate in the following words:\u2014\u201cWe find by experience, that a thing will always exhibit the same appearances in some respects, though it admit of changes in others; or, in Mr Locke's language, that certain numbers of simple ideas go constantly together, whereas some others do not. The former of these we call the fulness, thing, or being, itself; the latter are termed its modes or accidents. Thus the substance of body, as far as we know of it, consists in solidity and extension; which being necessarily finite, it also becomes capable of division, figure, and motion. These are its original inseparable qualities,\nbody; and men have been probably led into this notion from a conviction that such *substratum*, whatever it be, is and must be solid; but that solidity is only a quality inseparable from the first matter, and not that matter itself, must be evident from this consideration, that solidity is the same in all bodies, and incapable of producing by itself any other effect than that of excluding from the place occupied by it every other solid substance. It could not of itself be the *substratum* of colour, taste, or smell, otherwise all bodies would be coloured, savoury, and odorous; and as, according to all our notions of it, it is incapable of any change, it could not by itself be so modified as to excite in us these sensations.\n\nThe things then immediately perceived by us, or of which we have any adequate idea or conception, are only qualities which must belong to a subject; and all that we know about this subject is, that it is that to which such qualities belong. From this it is evident, that our notion of matter, as distinguished from its qualities, is a relative and obscure notion, and must remain obscure till men have other faculties. In this the philosopher seems to have no advantage above the vulgar: for as they perceive colour, and figure, and motion, by their senses, as well as he does; and as both are equally certain that there is a subject of those qualities; so the notions which both have of this subject are equally obscure; or, to speak more properly, they have no positive notion of it at all. When a philosopher calls it the *first matter*, a *substratum* or a *subject of inclusion*, those learned words convey no meaning but what every man understands and expresses, by saying in common language, that it is a thing extended, solid, and moveable.\n\nThey are therefore *qualities*, or in the language of ancient philosophy, *forms* alone, about which, in corporeal substances, we can reason with precision and certainty; and it is sufficient for all the purposes of life that we have of them an adequate knowledge. Of the For as the first matter or original *substratum* of all bodies seems to be the same, though we know not what it is; and as one body is distinguished from another only by its qualities or powers; a knowledge of the nature of these is all that can be necessary to direct our conduct with respect to the various objects with which we are surrounded.\n\nQualities thus considered in bodies, are, first, such Qualities, as are utterly inseparable from the body, in what state and forever it is; such as in all the changes and alterations which it suffers, and under all the force which can be employed upon it, it constantly keeps. Thus, in the instance already given, a stick of sealing wax may, by the operation of fire, be rendered liquid or reduced to smoke and ashes; and when it has undergone these changes, it has lost many of the sensible qualities which it had when a long round substance fit for the purpose of sealing letters; but other qualities which were then perceptible in it still remain: for not only liquid wax, but every particle of smoke and ashes, is solid and extended, as well as the hardest or largest body; and every such particle has likewise some figure, and is capable of motion or rest. Again, If a grain of wheat or any other corporeal substance, be divided into two parts, and each part be again divided without end, still the smallest particle of it will be solid, extended, of some figure, and capable of further division. Solidity, extension, divisibility, and motion or rest, are therefore qualities inseparable from body, and have on that account been with great propriety called its original or primary qualities.\n\nThere are other qualities, which in truth are nothing secondary, in the bodies themselves, but powers arising from the magnitude, figure, texture, and motion, of their insensible parts to produce in us various sensations; such are colours, sounds, tastes, and odours. These have been denominated secondary qualities; and to them may be added\n\nlities, which constitute the thing, and seem not to depend on any thing else as a subject. But a particular figure, motion, &c. are only accidents or modes of its existence; which do not necessarily attend it, though they themselves cannot be supposed to exist without it. The substance of spirit consists in the powers of thinking and acting, which likewise admit of various modifications. This seems to be all that we can learn concerning the nature of things from observation and experience. To inquire into the manner how these, which we call properties, exist together, or to attempt to explain the cause, ground, or reason, of their union, is in vain. To assign the word *substratum* for a representation of it, is saying nothing: it is setting a mere word for what we have neither any idea of nor occasion for. Indeed if we consider these primary qualities as needing something to inhere in, we are obliged to seek for something to support them; and by the same way of reasoning, we may seek for something else to support that other something, and so on; and at last shall find no other support for the whole but the cause which produced it.\" \"Dr Watts (continues the Bishop) is of opinion, that it is introducing a needless scholastic notion into the real nature of things, and then fancying it to have a real existence:\" (Logic, p. 14.) The author of the Procedure, Extent, &c. affirms, \"That as far we directly know the essential properties of any substance, so far we have a direct knowledge of the substance itself; and if we had a direct knowledge of all the essential properties of any substance, we should have an adequate knowledge of that substance; for surely, if there be any meaning in words, the knowing any thing of the essential properties of a thing is knowing so much of its very substance.\"\n\nThat the substance of body consists in solidity and extension, and nothing more; and that these depend not upon any thing else as a subject; cannot be true: for solidity, in our conception, is nothing but impenetrability; but whoever uses the word impenetrability, certainly means that there is something impenetrable. That there is some real thing or being different from solidity and extension, which impresses us with the notion that it is solid and extended, is self-evident to all mankind: if it be not matter, these conceptions must be communicated to us by the immediate agency of the Deity, which seems to have been the real opinion of the Bishop of Carlisle. But this differs not from the theory of Berkeley, which we shall consider by and by.\nadded a third fort, which are universally allowed to be barely powers, though they are in fact as much real qualities in the subject as those we have just mentioned. Thus the power in fire to produce by its primary qualities a new colour or consistence in wax or clay, is as much a quality in the fire as the power which it has to produce in us a new sensation of warmth or burning. That colours, tastes, sounds, and odours, as they are perceived by us, are mere sensations, has been already proved; and that the powers in the bodies which produce these sensations are not, like solidity and extension, inseparable from the body to which they may belong, is evident; because a piece of red wax may be reduced to black ashes; and because by pounding an almond we may change its clear white colour into a dirty hue, and its pleasant taste into one that is oily and rancid; and a single rent through the body of a bell destroys its sound.\n\nThe primary qualities of body have a real existence independent of us and of every other creature. Thus the particular bulk, number, figure, and motion, of the parts of fire or snow are really in the fire or snow, whether any man's senses perceive them or not; and therefore these may be called real qualities, because they really exist in the bodies: But light, heat, whiteness, or cold (as they are perceived by us), are no more really in fire or snow, than sicknesses in tartar or pain in a sword. Take away the sensations of them: let not the eyes see light or colours, nor the ears hear sounds; let not the palate taste nor the nose smell; and all colours, tastes, odours, and sounds, as they are such particular sensations, vanishing and ceasing, and are reduced to their causes, i.e., to the bulk, figure, and motion of the parts of the body.\n\nThe qualities then that are in bodies, rightly considered, are of three sorts. 1. The bulk, figure, number, situation, and motion or rest, of their solid parts. Of these, as they are in themselves, we have clear and distinct notions. We know that they are in the body whether we perceive them or not, and we call them primary or essential qualities. 2. The power that is in any body, by reason of its internal texture and inflexible primary qualities, to operate upon our senses in a peculiar manner, producing in us the different sensations of colours, sounds, tastes, or smells, &c. These we have called secondary qualities, but they are often termed sensible qualities. 3. The power that is in any body, by reason of the particular constitution of its primary qualities, to make such a change in the bulk, figure, texture, and motion of another body, as to make it operate on our senses differently from what it did before. Thus, the sun has a power to make wax white, and fire to make lead fluid. These are universally called powers; but we have no such notions of them as we have of the primary qualities of bodies. We know that they exist, but we know not what they are. It has indeed been discovered, that the sensation of smell is occasioned by the effluvia of bodies*; that of sound by their vibration. The disposition of bodies to reflect a particular kind of light occasions the sensation of colour; and the operation of the minute parts of bodies upon the nerves of the tongue and palate is the cause, and cause of tastes. Very curious discoveries have been made of the nature of heat and its manner of operating, and an ample field still remains. We are likewise intuitively certain, that body can operate upon body only by impulse; but how certain impulses upon certain organs should produce sensations in us to which there is nothing similar in the impelling body, is equally unknown to the clown and the philosopher.\n\nSuch is the distinction which in modern philosophy is made between primary and secondary qualities; but true of the ancient atomists regarding atoms. At the head of these were Thales and Pythagoras (\u03ba); and we may infer from Aristotle, that the sect comprehended almost all the physiologists who taught before himself and Plato: for he says\u2020, \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u039b\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03af\u03c0\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c3\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u1ff6\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2, \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03b1\u1f34\u03c3\u03b8\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1 \u1f22 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b8\u03ae\u03c4\u03b1 \u1f22 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f10\u03bd \u03b5\u1f50\u03c1\u03cd\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03c7\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2: \"Democritus, and most of the physiologists, fall into a great absurdity; for they make all sense to be touch, and resolve sensible qualities into the figures of inflexible atoms.\" And he adds, that \"the former physiologists (without exception) said not well, that there is no black and white without the sight, nor bitter and sweet without the taste.\" Elsewhere he tells us, De Generatione et Corruptione, that those philosophers explained generation and alteration out of forms and qualities, by figures and local motion. \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u039b\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03af\u03c0\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c3\u03b9 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c3\u03c7\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u03bc\u1f72\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b8\u03ae\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u1fd6 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u1f78\u03bd \u03c4\u03cd\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u1f22 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 \u1f00\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2. \"Democritus and Leucippus having made figures (or variously figured atoms) the first principles, make generation and alteration out of these; namely, generation\n\n(\u03ba) This is denied by Bishop Warburton, who thinks nothing better settled than that Democritus and Leucippus were the authors of the atomic physiology. We highly respect the learning and ingenuity displayed in the Divine Legation of Moses; but on this point we are convinced that its author is mistaken. Strabo expressly affirms, that Moschus the Phoenician was the author of the atomic physiology; and Cudworth has proved, by arguments which to us are perfectly satisfactory, that Thales and Pythagoras were both atomists, and that they derived the doctrine from Phenicia or Egypt. They did not, indeed, speculate in physics, but delivered their doctrines as they had received them from tradition, and they referred all motion to mind as its cause. Leucippus and Democritus, we believe, were the first speculative atomists; but though they refined upon, and perhaps improved, the mere mechanical part of the physiology of their matters, they unhappily dropt the better part of it; and, banishing mind from their system of the universe, they became materialists and atheists. With the sober and pious part of philosophers this brought the atomic theory to disrepute; and Plato and Aristotle, who were theists, when they opposed that theory, always pointed their arguments against Leucippus and Democritus, which is probably what led the learned Bishop to consider these atheists as the authors of the atomic physiology.\ntion together with corruption from the concretion and secretion of them, but alteration from the change of their order and position.\" By the atomic physiologists the name of quality was generally applied only to those things which we have called secondary qualities. The primary being considered as essential to matter, were seldom, if ever, called qualities. That the atoms, which they held to be the first principles of bodies, were figured, solid, extended, and moveable, is apparent, not only from the short view of their system which we have given from Cudworth, but likewise from the passages which we have just quoted from Aristotle; but the question debated between them and their antagonists was, whether those atoms had smell, taste, and colour; or, as it was commonly expressed, whether they had qualities? Democritus, Leucippus, and the other atomists, we see, maintained that they had not; and the following account of the doctrine of Protagoras, another philosopher of the school, shows, that on this subject at least the ancient advocates for the atomic system reasoned as justly as any of the moderns, and much more justly than the Peripatetics and Platonists by whom they were opposed. Plato having in his Theoreticus first said in general that the philosophy of Protagoras made all things to consist of a commixture of atoms and local motion, represents his doctrine concerning colours in particular, after this manner:\n\n\"First, As to that which belongs to the sight, you must conceive what is called a white or black colour, not to be anything absolutely existing either without your eyes or within your eyes; but black and white, and every other colour, is caused by different motions made upon the eye, from objects differently modified; so that it is nothing either in the agent or patient absolutely, but something which arises from between them both (1).\"\n\nFrom this passage it is plain, that Protagoras thought of colours exactly as Mr Locke thought, that they are not real qualities existing in bodies, but merely sensations excited in our minds; and indeed he is presently after represented as having called them \"in our imaginations, certain fancies or appearances in us.\" But there is in the Theoreticus another passage, in which a fuller account is given of the atomic philosophy, to this purpose: \"The principle upon which all these things depend is this, That the whole universe (m) is motion of atoms and nothing else: which motion is considered two ways, and is accordingly called by two names, action and passion. From the mutual congress, and, as it were, attrition of these together, are begotten innumerable offsprings, which, though infinite in number, yet may be reduced to two general heads, sensible and sensations, which are both generated at the same time. The sensations are seeing, hearing, and the like; and the corresponding sensibles are colours, sounds, &c. Therefore, when the eye and its proper object meet together, both the visible and the audible, the sensible idea of white and black, and the sensation of seeing, are generated together, neither of which would have been produced if those two had not met. The like is to be conceived of all other sensibles, as hot and cold, &c. None of these are absolute things in themselves, or real qualities in external objects; but they are begotten from the mutual congress of agent and patient, and that by motion. So that neither the agent has any such thing in it before its congress with the patient, nor the patient before its congress with the agent. But the agent and patient meeting together, and begetting sensation and sensibles, both the object and the sentient are forthwith made to be so and so qualified; as when honey is tasted, the sensation of tasting, and the quality of sweetness, are begotten together, though the sensation be vulgarly attributed to the taster, and the quality of sweetness to the honey.\"\n\nThe conclusion of all which is summed up thus, \u03b5\u1f30\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1f78 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8' \u1f21\u03bc\u1fd6\u03bd, \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u1f70 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0' \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b3\u03b5\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b7\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03b1: \"Not one of these sensible things is anything absolutely in the object without, but they are all generated or made relative to the sentient (n).\"\n\nThe language of ancient philosophy was defective in precision; terms were used vaguely and improperly, so that the meaning of the author is often to be collected only from the context. When Protagoras is here made to say, that when the agent and patient meet together, both the object and the sentient are forthwith made to be so and so qualified; as when honey is tasted, the sensation of tasting and the quality of sweetness are begotten together; it could not be his meaning, that any real change is made upon the external object merely by our tasting it, but only that the actual sensation and the sensible idea of sweetness are produced at once; just as he had said before, that the sensible idea of white or black, and the sensation of seeing, are generated together. If his words be thus interpreted they express a noble truth; and the whole passage shows, that the ancient atomic theory differed not from the theory of Descartes, Newton, and Locke, being the most rational, as well as the earliest system of physics with which we have any acquaintance. By divesting body of essential forms distinct from matter and motion, and by giving to the first matter extension and solidity, it renders the corporeal world intelligible; and accounts for those appearances.\n\n---\n\n(1) \u03a5\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u1f72 \u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u1f34\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f40\u03c8\u03b9\u03ba\u1f78\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u1fb6\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1, \u1f45 \u1f02\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03af \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f21\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd \u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u1fc3 \u03bc\u1f74 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf \u1f22 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf \u1f22 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf \u1f22 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf \u1f22 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf, \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u1f70 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f15\u03bd\u03b5\u03ba\u03b5\u03bd \u1f22 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf \u1f22 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf \u1f22 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf \u1f22 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf \u1f22 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf. \u1f1c\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf \u1f22 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf \u1f22 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf \u1f22 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf \u1f22 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf \u1f22 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf.\n\n(2) Protagoras was a follower of Leucippus and Democritus in every thing, and of course an atheist.\u2014This, however, does not hinder him from having been a correct physiologist with respect to the composition of body; and as such only is he quoted by us.

See the Theoreticus; see also Cudworth's Intellectual System, Book i. chap. 1.\nChap. II.\n\nOf the Essences of Bodies.\n\nHaving treated of the substance, qualities, and essences of bodiespowers of body, we may seem to have exhausted this part of our subject; but there is still more to be done. Metaphysicians, ancient and modern, have introduced another term into the science, to denote that which distinguishes one species or sort of bodies from all other species or sorts; and this term we shall briefly explain. Gold is apparently different from lead, and from every other species of metal; a horse is apparently different from an ox; and from every other species of animals; and all animals apparently differ from all vegetables, as vegetables differ from metals.\n\nIt is only with the bodies, not the minds of animals, according to the Peri- that we are at present concerned; and we have seen that all bodies are composed of the same matter.\u2014Platonists, what then is it that makes different bodies exhibit to us such different appearances; or, in other words, how come they to be possessed of such different qualities and powers? It is (say the followers of Plato and Aristotle) from their having different essential forms, by which every natural substance is essentially characterized; for of every animal, vegetable, or metal, &c. there is a form conceived, as existing before the individuals in which it is incorporated, from which result all the properties of that animal, vegetable, or metal, such as figure, size, colour, and the other qualities perceptible by our senses; but this internal and essential form itself, from which all other forms result, is not perceptible by our senses, nor even by our understanding directly and immediately, nor otherwise than by the analogy formerly mentioned. These essential forms, we are told, mean something, which, though different from matter, can yet never subsist without it; something which, united with it, helps to produce every composite being, that is to say, in other words, every natural substance in the visible world.\n\nThis assertion Mr Harris submits with deference to his contemporaries; because (says he) \"I speak perhaps of spectres as shocking to some philosophers as those were to \u00c6neas which he met in his way to hell.\u2014Terribiles visu formae.\" The elegant author's unwillingness to frighten his contemporaries, was a proof of his amiable and benevolent disposition; but he needed not to have suffered from any such apprehension. Those spectres, apparently so dreadful, had long before been laid to rest by the incomparable Cudworth, who has demonstrated, that essential forms different from matter and motion, as they have no real existence, had no place in the most ancient philosophy; and that the different appearances or sensible qualities which different bodies exhibit, are the result of the different contexture of their insensible parts. Thus, gold and lead are composed of the same primary matter, but the atoms or minute parts of that matter are in one substance differently combined from what they are in the other; and this different combination is the sole cause that gold is specifically heavier than lead, more ductile, and of a different colour, &c. For the very same reason, iron is harder than either gold or lead, specifically lighter, and possessed of many other sensible qualities which are not found in either of these substances. One vegetable differs from another externally in size, colour, taste, smell, rapidity of growth, and proportion of parts, &c.; but all vegetables are composed of the same matter; and the external difference which prevails among them is the result of a different structure and motion of their insensible parts. The same is to be said of the differences which prevail among the bodies of animals; they all result from internal organization and motion, and from nothing else, whatever be the immediate cause of that motion.\n\nThis particular internal texture and motion of the real essences of bodies, is that which makes one sort of bodies differ externally from every other sort of bodies; and it is by modern metaphysicians called the real essence of bodies. Thus, that internal texture of minute parts, which makes gold of a bright yellow, extremely ductile, specifically heavier than all other metals, and soluble in aqua regia, is the real essence of gold; but what that essence is in itself no man can tell, as we perceive only the qualities which result from it. We are, however, certain, that it is different from the real essences of lead and iron, because it produces different effects from those which are produced by these essences; and different effects are never produced in the same circumstances by the same cause.\n\nWe have called the internal texture and motion of the insensible parts of bodies their real essences, to distinguish them from other essences which are only nominal, and with which we are perfectly acquainted, because they are the fabrication of our own minds.\u2014Thus, a beautiful bright yellow, a certain specific gravity, extreme ductility, and solubility in aqua regia, are the qualities by which we distinguish gold from all other metals. Of these qualities we frame a sort of general conception, which we call the essence of gold; and every substance in which we find this essence, we clasps under the specific name gold. For though it is obvious that our conceptions cannot be the real essences of things external, yet are they sufficient guides to these essences, as we know that bodies which, being all formed of the same matter, have the same internal organization or texture of parts, because it is only in that organization or texture that one body can differ from another.\u2014And so much for bodily substance, qualities, and essences.\n\nChap. III.\n\nOf the Existence of Matter.\n\nWe have endeavoured to prove, that all corporeal substances consist of minute atoms, solid and extended; and that the sensible qualities of every body result from the combination and motion of the atoms of which that body is composed. The celebrated Berkeley, bishop of Cloyne,\nC'oyne, however, attempted to demonstrate that these atoms have no real existence; and that the very supposition of a solid, extended, and inert substance, being the archetype of our ideas, involves in it an absurdity and contradiction.\n\nIt is universally allowed, that all our knowledge of matter is derived through the senses, either immediately in the very act of sensation, or mediately by an association which is resolvable into a process of reasoning. According to the principles which we have stated, and laboured to establish, matter itself is no immediate object of the senses; and as these are the principles upon which the bishop erected his demonstration, it will be incumbent upon us to consider his theory, because it has been represented as in the highest degree pernicious, and as leading to universal skepticism.\n\nThe author of the Essay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth, represents Berkeley as teaching us, \"that external objects (that is, the things which we take for external objects) are nothing but ideas in our minds; in other words, that they are in every respect different from what they appear to be; that matter exists not but in our minds; and that independent on us and our faculties, the earth, the sun, and the starry heavens, have no existence at all; that a lighted candle hath not one of those qualities which it appears to have; that it is not white nor luminous, nor round, nor divisible, nor extended; but that, for anything we know, or can ever know to the contrary, it may be an Egyptian pyramid, the king of Prussia, a mad dog, the island of Madagascar, Saturn's ring, one of the Pleiades, or nothing at all.\" With respect to the consequences of this theory, he affirms, that \"it is subversive of man's most important interests, as a moral, intelligent, and percipient being; and not only so, but also, that if it were universally and seriously adopted, the dissolution of society, and the destruction of mankind, would necessarily ensue within the compass of a month.\"\n\nThe dissolution of society and the destruction of mankind are indeed dismal consequences\u2014enough to make a man shudder in his closet. But do they really flow from Berkeley's system? They certainly do, if it be the aim of that system to prove that a candle has not any one quality which it appears to have, and that it may be a mad dog; for should all philosophers, by some means or other, become converts to the theory of Berkeley, as we know that the bishops Sherlock, Smalridge, and others, actually did, the dissolution of society and the destruction of mankind would indeed be inevitable. The scribbling race, by using mad dogs for candles, would all become infected with the hydrophobia; and having their natural irritability augmented by the canine rabies, they would bite and tear till not a human being were left alive.\n\nBut to drop this ludicrous style, so unsuitable to philosophical investigation and calm inquiry, we beg leave to affirm, that the theory of Berkeley is here totally and grossly misrepresented, and that not one of those dangerous consequences which flow from that misrepresentation can be fairly deduced from any thing taught in The Principles of Human Knowledge and the Dialogues on the Existence of Matter. So far is Berkeley from teaching that external things are nothing but ideas in our minds, and that they are in every respect different from what they appear to be, that he teaches the very reverse of this in the plainest language possible. \"I am of a vulgar cast (says he), simple enough to believe my senses, and leave things as I find them. It is my opinion, that the real things are those very things I see and feel and perceive by my senses. That a thing should really be perceived by my senses, and at the same time not really exist, is to me a plain contradiction. When I deny sensible things an existence out of the mind, I do not mean my mind in particular, but all minds. Now it is plain they have an existence exterior to my mind, since I find them by experience to be independent of it. There is therefore some other mind wherein they exist during the intervals between the times of my perceiving them; as likewise they did before my birth, and would do after my annihilation. And as the same is true with regard to all other finite created spirits, it necessarily follows there is an omnipotent eternal mind, which knows and comprehends all things, and exhibits them to our view in such a manner, and according to such rules, as he himself hath ordained, and are by us termed the laws of nature.\"\n\nSo far is Berkeley from teaching that, independent on us and our faculties, the earth, the sun, and the starry heavens, have no existence at all, and that a lighted candle has not one of those qualities which it appears to have, that he over and over affirms the direct contrary; that the universe has a real existence in the mind of that infinite God, in whom, according to the scriptures, we all live, and move, and have our being; that a lighted candle has not only all those qualities which it appears to have, but that, with respect to us, it has nothing else; that so far from being continually deceived by our senses, we are never deceived by them; and that all our mistakes concerning matter are the result of false inferences from true sensations.\n\nThe bishop makes the same distinction that we have made between ideas and notions; restraining the use of the former term to denote the relics of sensation, and employing the latter to denote our knowledge or conception of spirits and all such objects as are not perceived by sense. He likewise affirms, that we can have no idea of an external inert substance; because an idea can be like nothing but another idea, or the sensation of which it is a relic; and as all mankind admit that ideas and sensations can have no existence but in the mind of a percipient being, he therefore infers that we can have no idea of any thing existing, unperceived, and by consequence can have no idea of matter in the philosophical sense of that word. Solidity, extension, divisibility, motion, figure, colour, taste, and all those things which are usually called qualities primary and secondary, being according to him mere ideas, can have no existence but in a mind perceiving them; but so far is he from supposing their existence to depend upon the perception of our minds, that he says expressly, \"When in broad day-light I open my eyes, it is not in my power to choose whether I shall see or no, or to determine what particular objects shall present themselves to my view; and so likewise as to the hearing and other senses, the ideas imprinted on them are not creatures of my will. There is therefore some other will or spirit that produces them.\"\nThe question between the materialists and me is not, Whether things have a real existence out of the mind of this or that person? but, Whether they have an absolute existence, distinct from being perceived by God, and exterior to all minds? I assert, as well as they, that since we are affected from without, we must allow powers to be without in a being distinct from ourselves. So far we are agreed. But then we differ as to the kind of this powerful being. I will have it to be spirit; they matter, or I know not what third nature. Thus I prove it to be spirit: From the effects I see produced, I conclude there are actions; and because actions, volitions (for I have no notion of any action distinct from volition); and because there are volitions, there must be a will. Again, The things I perceive must have an existence, they or their archetypes, out of my mind: but being ideas, neither they nor their archetypes can exist otherwise than in an understanding: there is therefore an understanding. But will and understanding constitute in the strictest sense a mind or spirit. The powerful cause, therefore, of my ideas is, in strict propriety of speech, a spirit.\"\n\nThis is a faithful abstract of Berkeley's theory given in his own words. Matter, according to him, cannot be the pattern or archetype of ideas, because an idea can resemble nothing but another idea, or the sensation of which it is a relief. Matter, he thinks, cannot be the cause of ideas; for every cause must be active, and matter is defined to be inert and incapable of action. He therefore infers, that all our sensations of what we call the qualities of body are the effect of the immediate agency of the Deity upon our minds; and that corporeal substance has no existence, or at least that we have no evidence of its existence. That such may possibly be the origin of our sensations, no man will deny who reflects upon the infinite power and wisdom of the Agent from whom they are said to proceed. Dr Reid himself, the ablest of all Dr Berkeley's opponents, frankly acknowledges that no man \"can show, by any good argument, that all our sensations might not have been as they are, though no body or quality of body had ever existed.\"\n\nIn its consequences we do not perceive that this theory can be hurtful either to religion, to virtue, or to the benefits of common life; for it only explodes the notion of a substratum, which, though it may have a real existence, was never thought of by the generality of mankind in any nation under heaven. Dr Beattie indeed affirms, that in less than a month after the non-existence of matter should be universally admitted, he is certain there could not, without a miracle, be one human creature alive on the face of the earth. But this assertion must be the consequence of his mistaking Berkeley's non-existence of matter for the non-existence of sensible objects, the reality and existence of which the bishop never denied. On the contrary, he expressly says, \"We are sure that we really see, hear, feel; in a word, that we are affected with sensible impressions; and how are we concerned any farther? I see this cherry, I feel it, I taste it; and I am sure nothing cannot be seen, or felt, or tasted: it is therefore real. Take away the sensations of softness, moisture, redness, tartness, and you take away the cherry.\" All this is equally true and equally conceivable, whether the combined sensations which indicate to us the existence of the cherry be the effect of the immediate agency of God or of the impulse of matter upon our minds; and to the lives of men there is no greater danger in adopting the former than the latter opinion.\n\nBut it has been said, that Berkeley's doctrine necessarily leads to skepticism in religion, as the same kind of reasoning which he employs to prove the non-existence of matter, operates equally against the existence of mind, which and consequently against the possibility of a future state of rewards and punishments. \"The rational illus of this system (we are told) is skepticism with regard to every thing excepting the existence of our ideas and their necessary relations. For ideas being the only objects of thought, and having no existence but when we are conscious of them, it necessarily follows, that there is no object of our thought which can have a continued and permanent existence. Body and spirit, cause and effect, time and space, to which we were wont to ascribe an existence independent of our thought, all are turned out of existence by this short dilemma: Either those things are ideas of sensation or reflection, or they are not: If they are ideas of sensation or reflection, they can have no existence, but when we are conscious of them: If they are not ideas of sensation or reflection, they are words without any meaning.\"\n\nThis sophism was advanced as a consequence from Berkeley's principles by Mr Hume; and upon these principles it has been deemed unanswerable by subsequent philosophers of great merit. But is it really a part of Berkeley's system, or can it be fairly inferred from the principles on which that system is built? These questions it is fit that Berkeley should answer for himself: and we shall venture to affirm, that his answer will be perfectly satisfactory to every reader who attends to the distinction, which, after the bishop, we have stated between ideas and notions.\n\nThough we believe this dangerous inference from that author's principles is commonly attributed to Hume and as its author, it did not escape the sagacity of the bishop himself. In the third dialogue, Hylas, who pleads for the existence of matter, thus objects to the reasoning of his antagonist. \"Notwithstanding all you have said, to me it seems, that according to your own way of thinking, and in consequence of your own principles, it should follow, that you are only a system of floating ideas, without any substance to support them. Words are not to be used without a meaning. And as there is no more meaning in spiritual substance than in material substance, the one is to be exploded as well as the other.\n\nTo this Philonous answers: \"How often must I repeat, that I know or am conscious of my own being; and that I myself am not my ideas, but somewhat else; a thinking active principle, that perceives, knows, wills, and operates about ideas: I know that I, one and the same self, perceive both colours and sounds; that a colour cannot perceive a sound, nor a sound a colour; that I am therefore one independent principle, distinct from colour and sound; and, for the same reason, from all other sensible things and inert ideas. But I am not in like manner conscious either of the existence or essence of matter. Further, I know\nwhat I mean, when I affirm that there is a spiritual substance or support of ideas; i.e., that a spirit knows and perceives ideas. But I do not know what is meant, when it is said that an unperceiving substance hath inherent in it, and supports, either ideas or the archetypes of ideas. In the very notion or definition of material substance there is included a manifest repugnance and inconsistency. But this cannot be said of the notion of spirit. That ideas should exist in what doth not perceive, or be produced by what doth not act, is repugnant. But it is no repugnancy to say, that a perceiving thing should be the subject of ideas, or an active being the cause of them. That I, who am a spirit or thinking substance, exist, I know as certainly as I know that my ideas exist. I know likewise what I mean by the terms I and myself; and I know this immediately or intuitively; though I do not perceive it as I perceive a triangle, a colour, or a sound. Ideas are things inactive and perceived; and spirits a sort of beings altogether different from them, by which they are perceived. I do not, therefore, say, that my soul is an idea, or like an idea. However, taking the word idea in a large sense, my soul may be said to furnish me with an idea, that is, an image or likeness of God, though indeed extremely inadequate. For all the notion I have of God is obtained on reflecting on my own soul, heightening its powers, and removing its imperfections. I have, therefore, though not an inactive idea, yet in myself some sort of an active thinking image of the Deity. And though I perceive him not by sense, yet I have a notion of him, or know him, by reflection and reasoning. My own mind and my own ideas I have an immediate knowledge of; and by the help of these do immediately apprehend the possibility of the existence of other spirits and ideas. Farther, from my being, and from the dependency I find in myself and my ideas, I do by an act of reason necessarily infer the existence of a God, and of all created things in the mind of God. It is granted that we have neither an immediate evidence, nor a demonstrative knowledge, of the existence of other finite spirits; but it will not therefore follow, that such spirits are on a footing with material substances: if, to suppose the one be inconsistent, and if it be not inconsistent to suppose the other; if the one can be inferred by no argument, and there is a probability of the other; if we see signs and effects indicating distinct finite agents like ourselves, and see no sign or symptom whatever that leads to a rational belief of matter. I say, lastly, That I have a notion of spirit, though I have not, strictly speaking, an idea of it. I do not perceive it as an idea, or by means of an idea; but know it by reflection. Whereas, I neither perceive matter objectively as I do an idea, nor know it as I do myself by a reflex act; neither do I immediately apprehend it by similitude of the one or the other, nor yet collect it by reasoning from that which I know immediately. All which makes the case of matter widely different from that of the Deity and all spirits.\n\nThus far we think Berkeley's theory tenible, and its consequences harmless. That by the immediate agency of the Deity all our sensations might be what they are, though matter had no existence, we think he has proved by arguments unanswerable; and we are likewise of opinion, that by admitting the evidence of sense, consciousness, and reason, in their fullest extent, and by distinguishing properly between those things of which we have ideas, and those of which we not satisfy have notions, he has sufficiently secured the existence of spirits or perceiving beings, and obviated the irreligious sophistry of Hume before it was conceived by that author. But the good bishop stops not here. Not satisfied with proving that all our sensations lead us immediately to the Deity, and that, for aught we know, matter, as defined by philosophers, may have no separate existence, he proceeds farther, and endeavours to prove that matter cannot, possibly exist. This appears even in the extracts which we have quoted from his book, in which he talks of the repugnance and inconsistency of the notion. In this part of his system, we think he errs greatly, and advances an opinion altogether inconsistent with his own just principles.\n\nThe repugnance of which he speaks, arises solely from considering solidity and extension as relics of sensation, or ideas of the same kind with those of heat and cold, tastes and sounds. \"Light and colours, heat and cold, extension and figures; in a word, the things we see and feel; what are they (says his lordship), but so many sensations, notions, ideas, or impressions, on sense? and is it possible to separate even in thought any of these from perception? Some there are who make a distinction betwixt primary and secondary qualities: by the former, they mean extension, figure, motion, rest, solidity or impenetrability, and number: by the latter, they denote all other sensible qualities, as colours, sounds, tastes, and so forth.\u2014The ideas we have of these they acknowledge not to be the resemblances of anything existing without the mind, or unperceived; but they will have our ideas of the primary qualities to be patterns or images of things which exist without the mind, in an unthinking subsistence which they call matter. But it is evident that extension, figure, and motion, are only ideas existing in the mind; that without extension solidity cannot be conceived; that an idea can be like nothing but another idea; and that consequently neither they nor their archetypes can exist in an unperceiving substance. Hence it is plain, that the very notion of what is called matter, or corporeal substance, involves a contradiction in it.\"\n\nThis account of extension and solidity affords a fallacious striking instance how much the most vigorous and upright mind is liable to be warped by prejudice in behalf of a darling theory, and how apt the clearest understanding is to be blinded by the equivocal use of terms. That Bishop Berkeley possessed a vigorous and perspicacious mind, his most vehement antagonists are eager to admit; and that his intentions were good, is known to all Europe. Yet by the equivocal use of the word idea, which the writings of Locke had then introduced into the language of philosophy, he has here suffered himself to lose sight of a very proper and accurate distinction, which, so far as we know, was among the moderns first made by himself between ideas and notions. According to the bishop, \"we have a notion of power and a notion of spirits, but we can have no idea either of the one or the other; for all ideas being passive\nNow we beg leave to affirm, that what is here said of spirits, and of which we readily admit the truth, is equally true of material or solid substances. We have no ideas of solidity and extension, because these things are not originally impressed upon the senses; but we have very distinct though relative notions of them, for they are clearly perceived by the effects which they produce. That this is at least possible, we have the acknowledgement of Bishop Berkeley himself: for he \"freely owns, that from a cause, effect, operation, sign, or other circumstance, there may reasonably be inferred the existence of a thing not immediately perceived; and that it were absurd for any man to argue against the existence of that thing, from his having no direct and positive notion of it.\" This is exactly the case with respect to solid substances. These substances we do not immediately perceive; but we infer their existence from effects, signs, and other circumstances, and we have of them very clear though relative notions. Thus a man can open and shut his empty hand; but when he grasps an ivory ball of three or four inches diameter, he feels, that though the same power be exerted, his hand cannot then be shut. He is conscious that there is no change in himself; and being intuitively certain that every effect must have a cause, he infers with the utmost confidence, that the cause which prevents his hand from shutting is in the ball; or, in other words, that the thing which communicates to his eye the sensation of colour, and impresses upon his hand a sensation of touch, must be solid or impenetrable. Solidity, however, is not the sensation itself; it is only the cause of the sensation; and therefore it is so far from being an idea in our minds, that we are conscious our notion of it is of a thing totally different from all our ideas, of a thing external, at least to our minds. Indeed the notion itself is not positive; it is only relative, and inferred from the effects which are produced on our senses. That it is the same thing which communicates to our eye the sensation of colour, and has the power of resisting the compression of our hand, is evident: because, when the ball is thrown away, the resistance as well as the actual sensation vanish at once.\n\nFrom this fact, which a less acute man would think a proof that the resistance was not occasioned by the immediate agency of the Supreme Being, but by the impenetrability of a solid substance of small dimensions, the bishop argues thus against the possibility of such a substance: \"They who assert that figure, motion, and the rest of the primary or original qualities, do exist without the mind in unthinking substances, do at the same time acknowledge, that colours, sounds, heat, cold, and such like secondary qualities, do not; which they tell us are sensations existing in the mind alone, that depend on and are occasioned by the different size, texture, and motion, of the minute particles of matter. This they take for an undoubted truth, which they can demonstrate beyond all exception. Now if it be certain, that those original qualities are inseparably united with the other sensible qualities, and not even in thought capable of being abstracted from them, it plainly follows, that they exist only in the mind. But I desire any one to reflect and try whether he can by any abstraction of thought conceive the extension and motion of a body, without all other sensible qualities. For my own part, I see evidently that it is not in my power to frame an idea of a body extended and moved, but I must withal give it some colour or other sensible quality, which is acknowledged to exist only in the mind. In short, extension, figure, and motion, abstracted from all qualities, are inconceivable. Where, therefore, the other sensible qualities are, there must be these also, to wit, in the mind, and nowhere else.\"\n\nIn this reasoning, though plausible, there is an unintended fallacy. It is indeed true, that we cannot contemplate in imagination a solid substance without conceiving it to have some colour; but there is sufficient reason to believe, that this union of colour and solidity in our minds is not the effect of nature as it operates at first upon our senses, but merely the consequence of early and deep-rooted association. Bishop Berkeley himself has taught us, that the objects of sight are not at a distance; and that if a man born blind were suddenly made to see, he would conceive the objects of his sight as existing either in his eye or in his mind. This is a truth which no man will controvert who has dipped into the science of optics, or who has even paid the slightest attention to the perceptions of infants; and if so, it follows, that to a man born blind and suddenly made to see, colour and solidity would not appear united. Were such a person to lay hold of an ivory ball and raise it to the elevation of his eye, he would perceive whiteness as a new sensation existing in his eye or his mind, but he would feel resistance at the extremity of his arm. He would not have the least reason to conclude, that this whiteness was inseparably united to the cause of this resistance; and he would, in fact, draw no such conclusion, till experience had taught him, that by removing the ball or cause of resistance from his hand, he at the same time removed the sensation from his eye. After repeated experiments, he would indeed discover, that the cause of colour to the eye, was likewise by some means or other the cause of resistance to the hand; and he would so associate these in his mind, that the one would never afterwards make its appearance as an idea or a notion without bringing the other along with it. The whole difficulty, therefore, in this case, is to break an early and deep-rooted association; for it is plain that the associated ideas were not originally united, and that solidity and colour were at first conceived as separate.\n\nIf the reader perceive not the force of this reasoning, we beg leave to recommend to him the following experiment, which, if we mistake not, will carry conviction to his judgement, that in the last quoted passage Bishop Berkeley has argued fallaciously, and that extension and colour are not inseparably united as ideas in the mind. Let him go into a dark room, containing a number of spherical bodies of various colours; let him take one of them into his hand; and\nOf the Existence of Matter.\n\nAnd he will instantly feel resistance, and have a notion of extension and solidity; but will he likewise have the idea of colour inseparably united with this notion? The bishop says he will; and if so, it must be the idea of some particular colour; for his lordship has taught us, that the abstract and general idea of colour, which is neither red, nor green, nor blue, &c., cannot possibly be formed. The man, then, we shall suppose, whilst he feels resistance, conceives the resisting body to be green; and holding it still in his hand, walks into the light of day. The resistance, and consequently the cause of resistance, remains unchanged; but what becomes of the inseparable union of those with colour, when the body, upon being actually seen, proves to be black, i.e., to have no colour at all?\u2014It appears, therefore, undeniable, that solidity and colour are not united in nature; that the one is an essential quality of something external to us, of which we have no idea, but a very distinct though relative notion; and that the other is an actual sensation in our minds, caused by the impression of something external on the organ of sense, which leaves behind it in the memory or imagination a positive and direct idea that exists nowhere else.\n\nSolid substance, therefore may exist, for though it is not immediately perceived by the senses, and is a thing of which we can have no idea, we acquire a clear and distinct notion of it, by the very same means which Bishop Berkeley thinks sufficient to give us distinct notions of power and of spirits; and, therefore, that notion can involve in it no contradiction. Still, however, we would not say with Dr Beattie, \"that we could as easily believe, that two and two are equal to ten; or, that whatever is, is not; as that matter has no separate existence:\" for it is certainly possible, that the Supreme Being, without the instrumentality of matter, could communicate to our minds all the sensations and notions from which we infer the reality of solid substance. All that we contend for, as having the evidence of demonstration, is the possibility of solid and extended substance; and if the thing be possible, the general voice of mankind proclaims its probability.\u2014We are conscious of our actual sensations, and we know by experience that they are caused by something distinct from ourselves. When a man grasps an ivory ball, he feels that he cannot shut his hand, and he knows that the resistance which prevents him proceeds not from himself. Thus far all mankind are agreed. But Bishop Berkeley says, that the resistance proceeds immediately from the Supreme Being or some other spirit; whilst we, without pretending that his scheme is impossible, think it more natural to suppose that the man's hand is kept from shutting by the resistance of a solid substance of four inches diameter; of which substance, though we have no idea of it, we have as distinct a notion as Berkeley had of spirits. From one or other of these causes this effect must proceed; and it is of little importance to life or happiness which of them be the true cause, since it is with the effect only that we are immediately concerned. Still, however, a philosopher would choose to adopt the easiest and most natural side of every alternative; which, if our notion of solidity be just, is certainly, in the present case, the existence of matter.\n\nAfter treating so largely of the composition of bodies, and showing the general agreement of metaphysicians, ancient and modern, with respect to the notion of their solidity, it will appear strange to the less philosophical part of our readers, that we should now express a doubt of that notion's being well-founded.\u2014Is it borne We have ourselves no doubt, but on the contrary are thoroughly convinced, that solidity is essential to matter. This, need to be however, has of late been denied by philosophers of great merit. Dr Priestley, after Mr Mitchell and Father Bozovich, affirms that matter is not solid or impenetrable to other matter; and that it has, in fact, no properties but those of attraction and repulsion.* The Disproofs of this position, which appears to be paradoxical, draws from optical experiments, from electricity, and from the effects of heat and cold upon substances usual and conceived to be solid.\n\nThe appearances from which the solidity of matter with Dr is inferred, are nothing more, he says, than superficial price appearances, and therefore have led to superficial and fallacious judgments, which the real appearances will not authorize. \"Resistance, on which alone our opinion in support concerning the solidity and impenetrability of matter, of this hypothesis is founded, is never occasioned by solid matter, but by something of a very different nature, viz., a power of repulsion, always acting at a real, and in general an assignable distance, from what we call the body itself. When I press my hand against the table, I naturally imagine that the obstacle to its going through the table, is the solid matter of which it consists; but a variety of philosophical considerations demonstrate that it generally requires a much greater power of pressure than I can exert to bring my fingers into actual contact with the table. Electrical appearances show that a considerable weight is requisite to bring into seeming contact even the links of a chain hanging freely in the air, they being kept aloft by a repulsive force belonging to a very small surface, so that they do not actually touch, though they are supported by each other. It has been shown, from optical considerations, that a drop of water rolls upon a cabbage leaf without ever coming into actual contact with it; and indeed all the phenomena of light are most remarkably unfavourable to the hypothesis of the solidity or impenetrability of matter. When light is reflected back from a body on which it seems to strike, it was natural to suppose that this was occasioned by its impinging against the solid parts of the body; but it has been demonstrated by Sir Isaac Newton, that the rays of light are always reflected by a power of repulsion acting at some distance from the body. Again, When part of a beam of light has overcome this power of repulsion, and has entered any transparent substance, it goes on in a right line, provided the medium be of a uniform density, without the least interruption, and without a single particle being reflected, till it comes to the opposite side, having met with no solid particles in its way, not even in the densest transparent substances, as glass, crystal, or diamond; and when it is arrived at the opposite side, it is solely affected by the laws of attraction and repulsion.\n\n\"Nay, that the component particles of the hardest bodies themselves do not actually touch one another, is demonstrable from their being brought nearer together by cold, and by their being removed farther from each other by heat. The power sufficient to overcome these\nOf the Existence of Matter.\n\nThese internal forces of repulsion, by which the ultimate particles of bodies are prevented from coming into actual contact, is what no person can pretend to compute. The power requisite to break their cohesion, or to remove them from the sphere of each other's attraction, may in some measure be estimated; but this affords no data for ascertaining the force that would be necessary to bring them into actual contact, which may exceed the other almost infinitely.\"\n\nFrom these facts, Dr Priestley infers, that the mutual resistance of bodies proceeds in all cases from powers of repulsion acting at a distance from each body: that the supposition of the solidity or impenetrability of matter is destitute of all support whatever; and that matter itself is nothing but powers of attraction and repulsion, and several spheres of them, one within another. As other philosophers have said, \"Take away solidity, and matter vanishes;\" so he says expressly, \"Take away attraction and repulsion, and matter vanishes.\"\n\nTo illustrate this strange notion, \"Suppose (says he) that the Divine Being, when he created matter, only fixed certain centres of various attractions and repulsions, extending indefinitely in all directions, the whole effect of them to be upon each other: these centres approaching to, or receding from each other, and consequently carrying their peculiar spheres of attraction and repulsion along with them, according to certain definite circumstances. It cannot be denied that these spheres may be diversified infinitely, so as to correspond to all the kinds of bodies that we are acquainted with, or that are possible. For all effects in which bodies are concerned, and of which we can be sensible by our eyes, touch, &c. may be resolved into attraction or repulsion. A compages of these centres, placed within the spheres of each other's attraction, will constitute a body that we term compact; and two of these bodies will, on their approach, meet with a repulsion or resistance sufficient to prevent one of them from occupying the place of the other, without a much greater force than we are capable of employing; so that to us they will appear perfectly hard.\n\n\"As in the constitution of all actual bodies that we are acquainted with, these centres are placed so near to each other, that in every division that we can make we still leave parts which contain many of these centres; we, reasoning by analogy, suppose that every particle of matter is infinitely divisible; and the space it occupies is certainly so. But, strictly speaking, as these centres which constitute any body are not absolutely infinite, it must be naturally possible to come by division to one single centre, which could not be said to be divisible, or even to occupy any portion of space, though its sphere of action should extend ever so far; and had only one such centre of attraction, &c. existed, its existence could not have been known, because there would have been nothing on which its action could have been exerted; and there being no effect, there could not have been any ground for supposing a cause.\"\n\nIn answer to this reasoning against the solidity of matter, Dr Priestley was frequently asked by his candid and masterly antagonist*, \"What is that attracts and repels, and that is attracted and repelled?\" But to the question he was never able to give a satisfactory answer. Indeed, how could he have been able? For, as Dr Price argues, \"Exclusive of attraction and repulsion, he affirms matter to be absolutely nothing; and therefore, though we were to allow it the power of attracting and repelling, yet as it is nothing but this power, it must be the power of nothing, and the very idea of it be a contradiction.\"\n\nIf there be any clasps of truths intuitively certain, that clasp comprehends the two following propositions:\n\nPower cannot be without a subject; and nothing can act where it is not. If, therefore, there be powers of attraction and repulsion, (which shall be considered afterwards in the Chapter of Motion), there must be a subject of those powers; and if matter, whether solid or fluid, be the subject, it cannot possibly attract or repel at a distance. Sir Isaac Newton, in his letters to Dr Bentley, calls the notion fallacious that matter possesses an innate power of attraction, or appearances that it can act upon matter at a distance, and attract and repel by its own agency, \"an absurdity into tuitive and which, he thought, no one could possibly fall.\" Hence necessary follows, that the appearances from which Dr Priestley infers the penetrability of matter must be fallacious appearances, since they contradict an intuitive and necessary truth. The facts which he instances are, indeed, such as would make most other men suspicious of fallacy, and in his reasonings from them he sometimes takes for granted the truth to be proved. The links of a chain used for electrical purposes, supposing them to be in contact with each other, can touch only with very small surfaces. The electrical fluid is of considerable density, and incapable of being absorbed within a very narrow compass. This is evident, because it passes not through paper and other porous bodies without making a passage for itself, and leaving a visible aperture behind it; and though it affiliates with metals, and passes through them more easily than through other bodies, yet is it plain that it requires a certain quantity of metal to conduct it; for when the conductor falls short of the necessary quantity, it is melted or diffused by the force of the fluid. This being the case, it follows that the links of a chain may be in actual contact (we do not positively affirm that they are), and yet the fluid become visible in passing from link to link; for if the point of contact be too small to absorb the whole fluid, part of it must pass without any metallic conductor through the atmosphere, and thus become apparent to the eye of the spectator.\n\nWith respect to light, it is obvious that there cannot possibly be any demonstration, in the logical sense of the word, that it is reflected by a power of repulsion acting at some distance from the body; for, in the opinion of all mankind, the primary and solid atoms of matter are too minute to fall under the cognizance of our senses, however assisted by art; and therefore, if light appears to be reflected at a distance from the surface of the body, we must conclude, either that between the point of reflection and the apparent surface of the body, there are solid atoms unperceived by us, or that light is reflected by the agency of some other substance than matter. One of these conclusions, we say must be drawn, because they are both possible, and there is no other alternative but to admit one of them, or to suppose that a thing may act where it is not;\nnot; which is as clearly absurd and impossible as that whatever is, is not. Again, When part of a beam of light has entered any transparent substance, how does Dr Priestley know that it goes on in a right line, without the least interruption, till it comes to the opposite side? This he can know only by his senses; but the beam may meet with ten thousand interruptions from objects which the senses cannot perceive, and may describe a zig-zag line, of which the deflections are so small as to elude the keenest eye aided by the most powerful glass.\n\nThat the component particles of the hardest bodies do not all actually touch one another, is indeed evident from the effects of cold and heat upon those bodies; but it does not therefore follow that those bodies have no component particles; but only, that they are fewer in number than we are apt to imagine; that all the solid matter in the universe might possibly be compressed within a very narrow sphere; and that it is held together in different bodies and different systems by a power foreign from itself. These are truths which all philosophers have admitted who have thought sufficiently on the subject; but who will admit Dr Priestley's proposition, when it is translated into common English: \"That the component nothings of the hardest bodies do not actually touch one another, is demonstrable from their being brought nearer together by cold, and by their being removed farther from each other by heat?\"\n\nDr Priestley owns, that if matter be solid it could act upon other matter by impulse. We are certain, that, whatever it be, it can act upon nothing in the manner which he describes; and therefore, to use the words of Dr Price, \"matter, if it be anything at all, must consist of solid particles or atoms occupying a certain portion of space, and therefore extended, but at the same time simple and uncompounded, and incapable of being resolved into any other smaller particles. It must likewise be the different form of these primary particles, and their different combinations and arrangement, that constitute the different bodies and kinds of matter in the universe.\" This is exactly agreeable to the doctrines of Newton; who, after considering the question in every point of view, concludes, that \"in the beginning God formed matter in solid, malleable, hard, impenetrable, moveable particles, of such sizes and figures, and with such other properties, as most conducted to the end for which he formed them; and that those primary particles being solid, are incomparably harder than any porous bodies compounded of them; even so very hard as never to wear or break in pieces: no ordinary power being able to divide what God himself made one in the creation.\" To talk, as Dr Priestley does, of matter's being certain centres of various attractions and repulsions extending indefinitely in all directions, and to describe these centres as not being physical points or solid atoms, is either to say, that nothing attracts and repels; or it is to introduce the divine agency as the immediate cause of all our sensations. The former of these alternatives Dr Priestley disclaims; the latter he seems willing to admit. But if it be his meaning that all our sensations are caused by the immediate agency of God or created spirits, his scheme differs not from that of Berkeley, except in being less elegantly expressed and less ingeniously supported. Berkeley's scheme is evidently possible. The commonly received scheme is likewise possible. It remains therefore with the reader, whether he will adopt the system of the Bishop of Cloyne; or admit, with all other philosophers, that matter exists; that it consists of parts actually distinct and separable; and that each of these parts is a monad or solid atom, which requires no foreign agency to keep it united.\n\nChap. IV. Of Space and its Modes.\n\nHaving considered bodies in their substance, cf. the necessities and qualities, and proved that they have a necessary real existence independent of us and our conceptions, we proceed now to inquire into the nature of space, motion, number, and duration. These are commonly called the adjuncts of body, and are supposed to be absolutely inseparable from its existence. It does not indeed appear that actual motion is a necessary adjunct of body, considered as a mere solid, extended, and figured substance; but it is certainly necessary to the existence of organized and animated bodies, and the capability of being moved enters into our conceptions of all bodies whatever. Of these adjuncts, that which first demands our attention is space: for without a knowledge of its nature we could not have an adequate idea of motion, and without motion we could have no idea of time.\n\nEvery body is extended; and between two bodies of space, not in actual contact, we perceive that a third body may be easily introduced. That which admits of the introduction of the third body is what we call space: and if it be totally void of matter, it is called pure space. Whether there be any space absolutely pure, has been disputed; but that such space is possible, admits of no dispute. Were any one body (a cannon ball for instance) to be annihilated, and the circumambient air, with every other material substance, kept from rushing into the space which the ball had occupied, that portion of space, with respect to matter, would be empty or pure space: whether it would necessarily be filled with mind shall be considered afterwards. Pure space, therefore, is conceivable; and it is conceived as having three dimensions, length, breadth, and depth, which are generally called the three simple modes of space. In this respect it agrees with body; but the agreement proceeds no farther; for space is conceived as destitute of solidity, without which the existence of body is inconceivable. It has been formerly observed, that whatever may be distinctly conceived may possibly exist; but with respect to the existence of pure space, whatever is possible is real: for it shall be shown in the next section, that were there no space absolutely pure or void of matter, there could be no motion. Our business at present is to inquire what the nature of space is, and what notion we ought to have of its existence.\n\nMany modern philosophers consider space as something entirely distinct both from body and mind: some of them ascribe to it no less than four of the attributes different of the Deity\u2014eternity, immobility, infinity, and necessary from body existence; and a few of them have gone so far as to and mind, call infinite space the sensation of the Deity. \"The and be supposal of the existence of anything whatever (says Dr Clarke infinite, &c.\nClarke *) necessarily includes a presupposition of the existence of space. Nothing can possibly be conceived to exist without thereby presupposing space; which, therefore, I apprehend to be a property or mode of the self-existent Substance; and that, by being evidently necessary itself, it proves, that the substance of which it is a property must be also necessary.\" Elsewhere he says, that \"space is a property or mode of the self-existent Substance, but not of any other substances. All other substances are in space, and are penetrated by it; but the self-existent Substance is not in space, nor penetrated by it, but is itself (if I may so speak) the substratum of space, the ground of the existence of space itself.\" He acknowledges, however, that such expressions as \"the self-existent Substance is the substratum of space, or space is a property of the self-existent Substance, are not, perhaps, very proper: but what I mean (says he), is this: The idea of space (as also of time or duration) is an abstract or partial idea; an idea of a certain quality or relation, which we evidently see to be necessarily existing; and yet (which not being itself a substance) at the same time necessarily presupposes a substance, without which it could not exist.\"\n\nThese opinions respecting space have been adopted by succeeding philosophers of great merit, and particularly by Dr Price, who says, that \"it is a maxim which cannot be disputed, that time and place are necessary to the existence of all things. Dr Clarke (continues he) has made use of this maxim, to prove that infinite space and duration are the essential properties of the Deity; and I think he was right.\"\n\nHad authority any weight in philosophy, we know not what modern writers we could oppose to the celebrated names of Clarke and Price, unless it were Bishop Berkeley, Dr Law late bishop of Carlisle, and the author of Ancient Metaphysics. But the question is not to be decided by authority. Learned and acute as Dr Clarke was, his assertions respecting space are contradictory and inconsistent. If nothing can possibly be conceived to exist without thereby presupposing the existence of space, how can space be a property or mode of the self-existent Substance? Are properties prior in the order of nature, or even in our conceptions, to the substances in which they inheres? Can we frame an abstract idea of figure, or extension, or solidity, before we conceive the existence of any one figured, extended, or solid substance? These are questions which every man is as capable of answering as the Doctors Clarke and Price, provided he can look attentively into his own mind, and trace his ideas to their source in sensation: and if he be not biased by the weight of great names, we are persuaded he will find, that if it be indeed true, that the supposal of the existence of any thing whatever necessarily includes a presupposition of the existence of space, space cannot possibly be a property or mode of the self-existent Substance, but must of necessity be a subsistence itself.\n\nIt is, however, not true, that the supposal of the existence of any thing whatever necessarily includes a presupposition of the existence of space. The idea of space is indeed so closely associated with every visible and tangible object, that we cannot see the one nor feel the other without conceiving them to occupy too much of space. But had we never possessed the senses of sight and touch, we could not have supposed the existence of space necessary to the existence of any thing whatever. The senses of smelling, tasting, and hearing, together with our internal powers of consciousness and intellect, would certainly have compelled us to believe in our own existence, and to suppose the existence of other things; but no object either of consciousness, smelling, tasting, or hearing, can be conceived as occupying space. Space and every thing which fills it are conceived as of three dimensions; but who ever supposed or can suppose an odour, taste, or sound, to have length, breadth, and depth; or an object of consciousness to be an ell or an inch long?\n\nLet us suppose that body and all the visible world had a beginning, and that once nothing existed but that Being which is alone of necessary as well as eternal existence; space, say the followers of Dr Clarke, would then exist likewise without bounds or limits. But we desire to know of these gentlemen what sort of a being this space is. It certainly is not subsistence; neither is it a property; for we have seen that the very notions of it, which lead men to suppose its existence necessary, render it impossible to be a property of the self-existent Being. Is it then nothing? It is in one sense*: it is nothing actually existing; but it is something potentially; for it has the capacity of receiving Metaphysical body whenever it shall exist. It is not, and cannot, become any thing itself, nor hath it any actual existence; but it is that without which nothing corporeal could exist.\" For this reason it was that Democritus and Epicurus made space one of the principles of nature; and for the same reason Aristotle has made privation one of his three principles of natural things, matter and form being the other two. But though the privation of one form be doubtless necessary before matter can receive another (for a piece of wax or clay cannot receive the form of a globe before it lose the form of a square), yet Aristotle never dreamed that the privation of the square was any property of the globe, or that privation itself was to be reckoned a real being. On the contrary, he expressly calls it \u03c4\u1f78 \u03bc\u1f74 \u1f44\u03bd, or the no being. In this way, if we please, we may consider space, and call it the privation of fullness or of body. We have indeed a positive idea of it, as well as of silence, darkness, and other privations: but to argue from such an idea of space, that space itself is something real, seems altogether as good sense as to say, that because we have a different idea of darkness from that of light, of silence from that of sound, of the absence of any thing from that of its presence; therefore darkness, silence, absence, must be real things, and have as positive an existence as light, sound, and body; and to deny that we have any positive idea, or, which is the very same thing, any idea at all, of the privations above mentioned, will be to deny what is capable of the most complete proof (see No. 19.), and to contradict common sense and daily experience. There are therefore ideas, and simple ones too, which have nothing ad extra correspondent to them; no proper idiom, archetype, or objective reality: and we do not see why the idea of space may not be reckoned of that number, on Klug's To say that space must have existence, because it has Origin of some properties (for instance, penetrability, or the capacity of receiving body), seems to be the same thing as to urge that darkness must be something because it has the Ideas the capacity of receiving light; silence the property of of Space, admitting &c.\nadmitting sound; and absence the property of being supplied by presence. To reason in this manner is to affirm absolute negations; and such as, in the same way, may be applied to nothing, and then call them positive properties; and so infer that the chimera, thus clothed with them, must needs be something.\n\nBut it is said, that as we cannot conceive space to be annihilated, it must be some real thing of eternal and necessary existence. If this argument had not been used by writers of great merit, and with the best intention, we should not have scrupled to call it the most contemptible sophism that ever disgraced the page of philosophy. Whatever now has an actual existence, must from eternity have had a possible existence in the ideas of the Divine mind. Body, as an extended substance, has now an actual existence; and therefore it must from eternity have had a possible existence in the ideas of the Divine mind: but the possible existence of body is all that we can conceive by space; and therefore this argument, upon which so much stress has been laid, amounts to nothing more, than that what has from eternity been possible, can at no period have been impossible. It is evident that the capacity or potentiality of every thing existing must have been from eternity; but is capacity or potentiality a real being? All the men and women who shall succeed the present generation to the end of time, have at this moment a possibility of existence, nor can that possibility be conceived as an impossibility; but is it therefore anything actually existing either as a substance or a quality?\n\nIt has been urged, that space must be something more than the mere absence of matter; because if nothing be between bodies, such as the walls of a room, they must necessarily touch. But surely it is not self-evident that bodies must necessarily touch if nothing be between them; nor of the truth of this proposition can any thing like a proof be brought. It is indeed intuitively certain, that \"things, when they are in contact, have nothing between them:\" and hence it has rashly been inferred, that things, when they have nothing between them, are in contact; but this is an illegitimate conversion of the proposition. Every logician knows, that to convert a proposition, is to infer from it another whole subject is the predicate, and whose predicate is the subject, of the proposition to be converted: but we are taught by Aristotle and by common sense, that an universal affirmative can be converted only into a particular affirmative. \"Things, when they are in contact, have nothing between them,\" is an universal affirmative proposition; and therefore it can be converted only into the following particular affirmative: \"Some things, when they have nothing between them, are in contact;\" a proposition which by no means includes in it the contact of the walls of an empty room.\n\nThe reason why the walls of an empty room do not touch, is that they are distant; but is distance, in the abstract, any thing really existing? Two individuals differ, or there is a difference between them; but is difference itself any real external thing? Bodies are long, broad, thick, heavy; but are length, breadth, density, weight, properly any thing? Have they any real separate archetypes or external idioms? Or can they exist but in some substance?\n\nThe reason why so many philosophers have considered space as a real external thing, seems to be this: Every bodily substance is extended; but space is conceived to be that which contains body, and therefore to space we likewise attribute extension. Extension is a quality which can have no existence but as united with other qualities in some substance; and it is that of which, abstracted from all substances, we can, properly speaking, form no idea. We understand the real meaning of the word, however, and can reason about that which it denotes, without regarding the particular substance in which extension may inheres; just as we can reason about whiteness without regarding any one white object, though it is self-evident that whites, abstracted from all objects, cannot figure in the mind as an idea. Qualities considered in this manner are general and relative notions, the objects of pure intellect, which make no appearance in the imagination, and are far less, if possible, to be perceived by sense: but it is extremely painful to the mind to dwell upon such notions; and therefore the ever-active fancy is always ready to furnish them with imaginary subtrata, and to make that which was a general and invisible notion be conceived as a particular ideal object. In the case of extension this is the more easily done, that the notion which we have of a real subtratum or substance, the support of real qualities, is obscure and relative, being the notion of something we know not what. Now, by leaving, if we can, solidity and figure out of our conception, and joining the notion of something with the notion of extension, we have at once the imaginary subtratum of an imaginary quality, or the general notion of extension particularized in an imaginary subject; and this subject we call space, vainly fancying that it has a real external and independent existence. Whether this be not all that can be said of space, and whether it be not absurd to talk of its having any real properties, every man will judge for himself, by reflecting upon his own ideas and the manner in which they are acquired. We ourselves have no doubt about the matter. We consider pure space as a mere notion relative to the existence of corporeal substance, as nothing more than the absence of body, where body is possible; and we think the usual distinction between absolute and relative space, if taken as real, the grossest absurdity. We do not however, pretend to dictate to others; but recommend it to every man to throw away all respect for great names, to look attentively into his own thoughts, and on this as on all metaphysical subjects to judge for himself.\n\nHaving said so much of space in general, we need not waste much time upon its modes. Indeed the only mode of space, after considering it with respect to the three dimensions of body, which now demands our attention, is that which we call place. As in the simplest mode of space we consider the relation of distance between any two bodies or points; so, in our idea of place, we consider the relation of distance betwixt any thing, and any two or more points, which, being considered as at rest, keep the same distance one from another. Thus, when we find any thing at the same distance now at which it was yesterday from two or more points with which it was then compared, and which have not since the comparison was made changed, their\ntheir distance or position with respect to each other, we say that the thing hath kept its place, or is in the same place; but if it hath sensibly altered its distance from either of these points, we then say that it hath changed its place.\n\nFrom this view of the nature of place, we need not observe that it is a mere relation; but it may be worth while to advert to this circumstance, that a thing may without falsehood, be said to have continued in the same place, and at the same time to have changed its place, according to the different objects with which it is compared. Thus, if two persons find a company of chefs-men standing each upon the same square of the chefs board where they left them, the one may with truth affirm that they are all in the same place, or unmoved; and the other may with equal truth affirm that they have all changed place. The former considers the men only with respect to their distances from the several parts of the chefs-board, which have kept the same distance and position with respect to one another. The latter must consider the men with respect to their distance from something else: and finding that the chefs-board, with every thing upon it, has been removed, we shall suppose from one room to another, he cannot but say that the chefs-men have changed their place with respect to the several parts of the room in which he formerly saw them.\n\nThis modification of distance, however, which we call place, being made by men for their common use, that by it they may define the particular position of objects where they have occasion for such designation, they determine this place by reference to such adjacent things as best serve their present purpose, without regarding other things which, for a different purpose, would better determine the place of the same object. Thus in the chefs-board, the use of the definition of the place of each chefs-man being determined only within that conquered piece of wood, it would cross that purpose to measure it by any thing else: but when these very chefs-men are put up in a box, if any one should ask where the black king is, it would be proper to determine the place by reference to something else than the chefs-board; such as the parts of the room or closet which contain the box.\n\nThat our idea of place is nothing but such a relative position of things as we have mentioned, will be readily admitted, when it is considered that we can have no idea of the place of the universe. Every part of the universe has place; because it may be compared with respect to its distance from other parts supposed to be fixed. Thus the earth and every planet of our system has a place which may be determined by ascertaining its distance from the sun and from the orbits of the other planets; and the place of the system itself may be ascertained by comparing it with two or more fixed stars: but all the systems taken as one whole can have no place; because there is nothing else to which the distance and position of that whole can be referred. It is indeed true, that the word place is sometimes used, we think improperly, to denote that space or portion of space which any particular body occupies; and in this sense, no doubt, the universe has place, as well as the earth or solar system: but to talk of the place of the universe in the other and proper sense of the word, is the grossest nonsense.\n\nMobility, or a capacity of being moved, is essential to every corporeal substance; and by actual motion are all the operations of nature performed. Mobility is certainly the most important of all its adjuncts; and, but not necessary to ascertain its nature and origin demands the closest attention of the metaphysician, as well as of the mechanical and astronomer. With the laws of motion, as discovered by experience, we have at present no concern: they are explained and fully established in other articles of this work (See Mechanics, Motion, &c.). The principal questions which we have to consider are: \"What is motion?\" and, \"By what power is it carried on?\"\n\nFor an answer to the first of these questions, the modern metaphysician refers every man to his own senses; because, in his apprehension, the word motion denotes a simple idea which cannot be defined. Among the ancients, the Peripatetics were of a different opinion; and Aristotle, whose love of dialectic made him define every thing, has attempted to give two definitions of motion. As some learned men are at present labouring to revive this system, we shall, out of respect to them, mention those definitions, and make upon them such remarks as to us appear proper.\n\nThe author of Ancient Metaphysics having observed, that both nature and art propose some end in all their operations; that when the end is obtained, the thing operated upon is in a state of perfection or completion; and that in the operations of both nature and art there is a progress, and by consequence a change, from one thing to another; adds, that this change is motion. Motion, therefore, according to him, is a change or progress to the end proposed, or to that state of perfection or completion which Aristotle calls \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c1\u03af\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd. It is not enough, however, that we know to what the change or progress is made: to have an adequate idea of motion, we must likewise know from what it proceeds. Now it is evident that every thing existing, whether by nature or art, was, before it existed, possible to exist; and therefore, adds the same author, things do in some sort exist even before they exist. This former kind of existence is said by Aristotle to be \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd, that is, in power or capacity. In this way, plants exist in their seeds; animals in the embryo; works of art in the idea of the artists and the materials of which they are made; and, in general, every thing in the causes which produce it. From this power or capacity there is a progress to energy or actual existence; so that we are now able to answer the question, \"from what, and to what, motion is a change?\" for it is universally true of all motion, that it is a change from capacity to energy.\n\nHaving thus discovered that motion lies betwixt capacity and energy, it is evident (he says) that it must have a connexion with each of them: and from this double connexion Aristotle has given us two definitions of it; one of them taken from the energy, or end to which it tends; the other from the capacity from which it begins. The first is expressed in two words, viz. \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c1\u03af\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, or imperfect energy; the other is \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c1\u03af\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd,\nThe perfection of what is in capacity, considered merely as in capacity. The meaning of the last words is, that nothing is considered in the thing that is moved but merely its capacity; so that motion is the perfection of that capacity, but not of the thing itself. It is something more (adds the learned author) than mere capacity; for it is capacity exerted, which when it has attained its end, so that the thing has arrived at that state to which it is destined by nature or art, ceases, and the thing begins to exist vivus, or actually.\n\nBy all the admirers of Aristotle, this latter definition has been preferred to the former; for what reason, it is difficult to say. They both involve in the thickest obscurity that which, viewed through the senses, is very easily understood; and on this, as on many other occasions, Aristotle was certainly guilty of darkening counsel by words without knowledge. The author, whose comment on this wonderful definition we have faithfully abridged, admits that it is not intelligible till we know what change and progress are; but is it possible to conceive any change to take place in bodily substances without motion? or, if we were called upon to explain what progress is, could we do it better than by saying that it is motion from something to something? It is likewise very obvious, that before we can have an adequate idea of motion, we must, according to this definition, know perfectly what the words capacity, energy, and perfection denote; and yet nothing can be more true than that perfection denotes a complex conception, which may be easily defined by resolving it into the simple ideas and notions of which it is compounded, whilst motion is susceptible of no such resolution. The perfection of a knife is compounded of the temper of the steel and the sharpness of the edge: the perfection of a system of philosophy consists of the importance of the subjects treated, the strength of the author's arguments, and the perspicuity of his style and manner; but of what is the motion of a ball, or an atom, or anything else, compounded? We are aware that to this question the modern Peripatetics will reply, That it is not the motion of a ball, or an atom, or any one thing, that their matter has so learnedly defined, but motion abstracted from all individuals, and made an object of pure intellect; and they will likewise affirm, that by the word perfection used in the definition, he does not mean any one kind of perfection as adapted to any particular object or end, but perfection abstracted from all objects and all ends. The perfection of nothing and the motion of nothing, for such surely are that motion and that perfection which are abstracted from all objects and ends, are strange expressions. To us they convey no meaning; and we have reason to think that they are equally unintelligible to men of greater acuteness (o). In a word, motion must be seen or felt; for it cannot be defined. To call it the act of changing place, or a passage from one place to another, gives no information; for change and passage cannot be conceived without previously conceiving motion (p).\n\nThe Peripatetics having idly attempted to define motion, proceeded next to divide it into four kinds or classes. This division was by the father of the school pretended to be made from the effects which it produces, and was said by him to belong to three categories, viz. quality, quantity, and where, (see CATEGORIES). The first kind is that well-known motion from place to place, which falls under the category last mentioned; the second is alteration, by which the quality of any thing is changed, the substance remaining the same. This belongs to the category of quality. The third is increase, and the fourth diminution, both belonging to the category of quantity. The ancient atomists, and all the modern metaphysicians of eminence, have with great propriety rejected this division, as being nothing but a collection of absurd distinctions where there is in nature no difference. It has been already shown, that body has no other real qualities than solidity, extension, and figure: but of these the first cannot be altered without destroying the substance; for every thing which is material is equally solid. The extension of a body may indeed be enlarged, and its figure may be altered, while the substance remains the same; but that alteration can be made only by moving from their places the solid atoms of which the body is composed. Aristotle's second kind of motion therefore differs not from the first; nor do the third and fourth differ from these two. For a body cannot be increased without acquiring new matter, nor diminished without losing some of the matter of which it was originally\n\n(o) \"Nunc dicendum de natura motus. Atque is quidem, cum sensibus clare percipiatur, non tam natu- ra sua, quam doctis philosophorum commentis obcuratus est. Motus nunquam in sensibus nostris incurret sine mole corporeae, spatio et tempore. Sunt tamen qui motum, tanquam ideam quandam simplicem et abstractam, atque ab omnibus aliis rebus separatam, contemplari student. Verum idea illa tenuissima et subtillissima intellectus adhuc eludit: id quod quilibet secum meditando experiri potest. Hinc nascuntur magnae difficulitates de natu- ra motus, et definitiones, ipsa re quam illustrare debent longe obcuriores. Hujusmodi sunt definitiones illae Aristotelis et scholasticorum, qui motum dicunt esse actum mobilis quatenus est mobile, vel, actum entis in potentia quatenus in potentia. Hujusmodi etiam est illud virt inter recitores celebres, qui afferit nihil in motu esse reale praeter momentaneum illud quod in vi ad mutationem nitente conficiatur debet. Porro constat, horum et similium defini- tionum auctores in animo habuisse abstractam motus naturam, fecula omni temporis et spatii consideracione, ex- plicare: fed qua ratione abstracta illa motus quintessentialia (ut ita dicam) intelligi polsit non video.\"\n\nBerkeley de Motu.\n\n(p) \"Multi etiam per transitum motum definunt, oblitii feliciter transitum ipsum sine motu intellecti non posse, et per motum definiri non poterere. Verissimum adeo est definitiones, fuit nonnullis rebus lucem, ita vicissim aliis tenebras afferre. Et profecto, quaesumque res senu percipimus eas clariores aut notiores definendo efficiere vis quisquam notuerit. Cuius rei vana fide allegati res faciles difficilissimas reddiderunt philosophi, mentosque tuas dis- cultatisbus, quas ut plurimum ipsi peperissent, implicaverere.\" Id. ibid.\nOriginally composed; but matter can neither be added nor taken away without motion from place to place; for there is now no creation de novo; and we have no reason to imagine that, since the original creation, a single atom has been ever annihilated. It is therefore past dispute, that local motion is the only motion conceivable; and indeed, as far as we are capable of judging from what we know of body, it is the only motion possible.\n\nThis has given rise to a question which has been debated among modern philosophers, though, as far as we know, it was never agitated among the ancients, viz. \"Whether, if there were but one solid body existing, that body could possibly be moved.\" Bishop Berkeley seems to be of opinion that it could not; because no motion can be conceived but what has a direction towards some place, and the relation of place necessarily supposes the existence of two or more bodies. Were all bodies, therefore, annihilated except one globe, it would be impossible (he thinks) to conceive that globe in motion (Q). With respect to the origin of our ideas of motion, his reasoning appears unanswerable; but we do not perceive how it concludes against the possibility of motion itself as existing in a single body. It has been already shown in the chapter of Simple Apprehension and Conception, that though nothing can be conceived which may not possibly exist, yet many things may be possible which we have not faculties or means to conceive. In the present instance, were this solitary globe animated as our bodies are, were it endowed with all our senses and mental powers, it certainly would not acquire any idea of motion though impelled by the greatest force. The reason is obvious; it would have no objects with which to compare its place and situation at different periods of time; and the experience of a ship at sea in calm weather, affords sufficient proof that motion which is equable cannot be perceived by any other means than by such a comparison. When the waves swell and the ship pitches, it is indeed impossible that those who are on board should not perceive that they are actually in motion; but even this perception arises from comparing their position with that of the waves rising and falling around them; whereas in the regions of empty space the animated globe could compare its position with nothing; and therefore, whether impelled by equal or unequal forces, it could never acquire the idea of motion. It may perhaps be thought, that if this solitary globe were a self-moving animal, it might acquire the idea of motion by inferring its existence from the energy which produced it. But how, we would ask, could an animal in such circumstances be self-moving? Motion is the effect of some cause; and it has been already shown (see No. 117, of this article), that we have no reason to suppose that any being can be the real and primary cause of any effect which that being can neither conceive nor will; but as motion can be perceived only by the senses, a solitary animal could have no idea of motion previous to its own exertions; and therefore could neither conceive, nor will, an exertion to produce it. Let us, however, suppose, that without any end in view it might spontaneously exert itself in such a manner as would produce sensible motion, were it surrounded with other corporeal objects; I will may venture to affirm, that so long as it should remain in absolute solitude, the being itself would acquire no idea of motion. It would indeed be conscious of the mental energy, but it could not infer the existence of motion as a consequence of that energy; for the idea of motion can be acquired only by sense; and by the supposition there are no objects from which the senses of this spherical animal could receive those impressions, without which there can be no perception, and of course no ideas.\n\nLet us now suppose, that, while this animated globe is under the influence either of external impulse or its own spontaneous energy, other bodies are suddenly brought into existence: would it then acquire the idea of motion? It certainly would, from perceiving its own change of place with respect to those bodies; and though at first it would not perhaps be able to determine whether itself or the bodies around it were moving, yet a little experience would decide this question likewise, and convince it that the motion was the effect either of its own mental energy, or that external impulse which it had felt before the other bodies were presented to its view. But it is obvious, that the creation of new bodies at a distance, can make no real alteration in the state of a body which had existed before them; and therefore, as this animated globe would now perceive itself to be moving, we may infer with the utmost certainty that it was moving.\n\n(Q) Having proved that place, in the proper sense of the word, is merely relative, and affirmed that all motion is relative likewise, the bishop proceeds thus: \"Verumtamen ut hoc clarius appareat, animadvertendum est, motum nullum intelligi posse sine determinatione aliqua seu directione, quae quidem intelligi nequit, nisi praeter corpus motum, nostrum etiam corpus, aut aliud aliquod, simul intelligatur existeret. Nam fursum, deorsum, sinistrorum, dextrorum, omnemque plagae et regiones in relatione aliqua fundantur, et necessario corpus a moto diversum contrahat et supponat. Adeo ut, si, reliquis corporibus in nihilum redactis, globus exempli gratia, unicus existeret supponatur; in illo nullus motus concipi possit: uique adeo necesse est, ut detur aliud corpus, cujus situ motus determinare intelligatur. Hujus sententiae veritas clarissima elucebit, modo corporum omnium tam nostrum quam aliorum, praeter globum illum unicum, annihilationem recte supponerimus.\n\n\"Concipiantur porro duo globi, et praeter eum nihil corporeum, existeret. Concipiantur deinde vires, quomodoquocumque applicari: quicquid tandem per applicationem virtutum intelligamus, motus circularis duorum globorum circa commune centrum nequit per imaginationem concipi. Supponamus deinde colorem fixarum creari: subito ex concepto appulsi globorum ad diversas coeli illius partes motus concipietur. Sicilet cum motus natura sua fit relativus, concipi non potuit priusquam darentur corpora correlata. Quemadmodum, nec ulla relatio alia sine correlatis concipi potest.\" De Motu.\nmoving before; and that the motion of a single body, though not perceivable by the senses, might possibly be produced in empty space.\n\nHaving thus seen that a single body is capable of motion in empty space, the next question that occurs on this subject is, Whether it would be possible to move a body in space that is absolutely full? Such are the terms in which this question is usually put; and by being thus expressed, it has given rise to the dispute among natural philosophers about the existence of a vacuum. Perhaps the dispute might have been avoided had the question been more accurately stated. For instance, had it been asked, whether motion would be possible, could matter be supposed absolutely infinite without any least interstice or vacancy among its solid parts? We apprehend that every reflecting man would have answered in the negative. At any rate, the question ought to be thus stated in metaphysics; because we have seen that space, though a positive term, denotes nothing really existing. Now it being of the very essence of every solid substance to exclude from the place which it occupies every other solid substance, it follows undeniably, that not one particle of an infinite solid could be moved from its place without the previous annihilation of another particle of equal extent; but that annihilation would destroy the infinity. Were matter extended to any degree less than infinity, the motion of its parts would undoubtedly be possible, because a sufficient force could separate those parts and introduce among them vacuities of any extent; but without vacuities capable of containing the body to be moved, it is obvious that no force whatever could produce motion. This being the case, it follows, that however far we suppose the material universe extended, there must be vacuities in it sufficient to permit the motion of the planets and all the other heavenly bodies, which we plainly perceive to revolve round a centre; and if so, the next question to be determined is, What can in vacuo operate upon such immense bodies, so as to produce a regular and continued motion?\n\nThat all bodies are equally capable of motion or rest, has by natural philosophers been as completely proved as any thing can be proved by observation and experience. It is indeed a fact obvious to the most superficial observer; for if either of these states were essential to matter, the other would be absolutely impossible. If rest were essential, nothing could be moved; if motion were essential, nothing could be at rest, but every the minutest atom would have a motion of its own, which is contrary to universal experience. With respect to motion and rest, matter is wholly passive. No man ever perceived a body inanimated begin to move, or when in motion, stop without resistance. A billiard ball laid at rest on the smoothest surface, would continue at rest to the end of time, unless moved by some force extrinsic to itself. If such a ball were struck by another ball, it would indeed be moved with a velocity proportioned to the impetus with which it was struck; but the impelling ball would lose as much of its own motion as was communicated to that upon which the impulse was made. It is evident, therefore, that in this instance there is no beginning of motion, but only the communication of motion from one body to another; and we may still ask, Where had the motion its origin? If the impelling ball was thrown from the hand of a man, or struck with a racket, it is plain that by a volition of the man's mind the motion was first given to his own arm, whence it proceeded through the racket from one ball to another; so that the ball, racket, and arm, were mere instruments, and the mind of the man the only agent or first mover. That motion can be begun by any being which is not possessed of life, consciousness, and will, or what is analogous to these, is to us altogether inconceivable. Mere matter or inanimated body can operate upon body only by impulse; but impulse, though from the poverty of language we are sometimes obliged to talk of its agency, is itself merely an effect; for it is nothing more than the contact of two bodies, of which one at least is in motion. An infinite series of effects without a cause is the grossest absurdity; and therefore motion cannot have been communicated from eternity by the impulse of body upon body, but must have been originally produced by a being who acts in a manner analogous to the energies of the human will.\n\nBut though motion could not have been begun by the energy of mind, it is generally believed that it might be continued by the mere passivity of body; and it is a law of the Newtonian philosophy, that a body projected in empty space would continue straight to move in a straight line for ever. The only reason, which can be assigned for this law is, that since body continues to move at all after the impetus of projection has ceased, it could not of itself cease to move without becoming active; because as much force is required to stop a body in motion as to communicate motion to the same body at rest. Many objections have been made to this argument, and to the law of which it is the foundation; but as we do not perceive their strength, we shall not fill our page with a formal examination of them (R). If a single body could exist and have motion communicated to it in vacuo by the force\n\n(r) By much the strongest and best urged of these objections which we have seen, is made by Dr Horsley, a man equally learned in mathematics and in ancient and modern philosophy. \"I believe with the author of Ancient Metaphysics (says he), that some active principle is necessary for the continuance as well as for the beginning of motion. I know that many Newtonians will not allow this: I believe they are misled, as I myself have formerly been misled, by the expression a state of motion. Motion is a change; a continuance of motion is a farther change; a farther change is a repeated effect; a repeated effect requires a repeating cause. State implies the contrary of change; and motion being change, a state of motion is a contradiction in terms.\" See Ancient Metaphysic, vol. ii.\n\nIf our readers think this reasoning conclusive, they may be in the right; and in that case they will see the necessity of admitting, even for the continuance of rectilinear motion, the plastic nature, or something equivalent\nforce of projection, we are persuaded, that from the very passivity of matter, that motion would never have an end; but it is obvious that it could be moved only in a straight line, for an impulse can be given in no other direction.\n\nThe heavenly bodies, however, are not moved in straight lines, but in curves round a centre; and therefore their motion cannot have been originally communicated merely by an impressed force of projection. This is admitted by all philosophers; and therefore the Newtonians suppose that the planets are moved in elliptical orbits by the joint agency of two forces acting in different directions. One of these forces makes the planet tend directly to the centre about which it revolves; the other impels it to fly off in a tangent to the curve described. The former they call gravitation, which some of them have affirmed to be a property inherent in all matter; and the latter, which in a projectile force, they consider as impressed ab extra. By the joint agency of such forces, duly proportioned to each other, Sir Isaac Newton has demonstrated, that the planets must necessarily describe such orbits as by observation and experience they are found actually to describe. But the question with the metaphysician is, Whether such forces be real?\n\nWith respect to projection, there is no difficulty; but that bodies should mutually act upon each other at a distance, and through an immense vacuum, seems at first sight altogether impossible. If the planets are moved by the forces of gravitation and projection, they must necessarily move in vacuo; for the continual resistance of even the rarest medium would in time overcome the force of the greatest impetus: but if they move in vacuo, how can they be attracted by the sun or by one another? It is a self-evident truth, that nothing can act but where it is present, either immediately or mediately; because every thing which operates upon another, must perform that operation either by its own immediate agency or by means of some instrument. The fun and planets are not in contact; nor, if the motion of these bodies be in vacuo, can anything material pass as an instrument from the one to the other. We know indeed by experience, that every particle of unorganized matter within our reach has a tendency to move towards the centre of the earth; and we are intuitively certain, that such a tendency must have some cause; but when we infer that cause to be a power of attraction inherent in all matter, which mutually acts upon bodies at a distance, drawing them towards each other, we talk a language which is perfectly unintelligible (s). Nay more, we may venture to affirm that such an inference is contrary to fact. The particles of every elastic fluid fly from each other; the flame of a fire darts upwards with a velocity for which the weight of the circumambient air cannot account; and the motion of the particles of a plant when growing, is so far from tending toward the centre of the earth, that when a flowerpot is inverted, every vegetable in it, as soon as it is arrived at a sufficient length, bends itself over the side of the pot, and grows with its top in the natural position.\n\nSensible of the force of these arguments against the possibility\n\nto it, without which we have endeavoured to prove, that the heavenly bodies could not revolve round their respective centres in elliptical curves.\n\n(s) A different opinion on this point is held by Professor Stewart in his Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind; a work of which the merit is such as to make it painful to us to differ in any important opinion from the ingenious author. We shall, however, claim the same liberty of dissenting occasionally from him that he has claimed of dissenting from Newton, Locke, Clarke, and Cudworth, from whom he differs widely in thinking it as easy to conceive how bodies can act upon each other at a distance, as how one body can communicate motion to another by impulse. \"I allow (says he, p. 79.) that it is impossible to conceive in what manner one body acts upon another at a distance through a vacuum; but I cannot admit that it removes the difficulty, to suppose that the two bodies are in actual contact. That one body may be the efficient cause of the motion of another body placed at a distance from it, I do by no means assert; but only that we have as good reason to believe that this may be possible, as to believe that any one natural event is the efficient cause of another.\"\n\nIf by efficient cause be here meant the first and original cause of motion, we have the honour to agree with the learned professor; for we are persuaded that body inanimated is not, in this sense of the word, the cause of motion either at hand or at a distance: but if he mean (and we think he must, because such was the meaning of Newton, from whom he professes to differ), that we can as easily conceive one body to be the instrumental cause of the motion of another from which it is distant, as we can conceive it to communicate motion by impulse, we cannot help thinking him greatly mistaken. We will not indeed affirm, with the writer whom he quotes, \"that although the experiment had never been made, the communication of motion by impulse might have been predicted by reasoning a priori;\" because we are not certain, that without some such experiment we should ever have acquired adequate notions of the solidity of matter: But if all corporeal substances be allowed to be solid and possessed of that negative power to which philosophers have given the name of vis inertiae, we think it may be easily proved a priori, that a sufficient impulse of one hard body upon another must communicate motion to that other; for when the vis inertiae, by which alone the one body is kept in its place, is less than the vis impetus with which the other rushes to take possession of that place, it is evident that the former body must give way to the latter, which it can do only by motion, otherwise the two bodies would occupy one and the same place, which is inconsistent with their solidity. But that a substance possessed of a vis inertiae should make another substance possessed of the same negative power quit a place to which itself has no tendency, is to us not only inconceivable, but apparently impossible, as implying a direct contradiction.\npossibility of an attractive power in matter which operates at a distance, other philosophers have supposed that the heavenly bodies are moved in elliptical orbits by means of two forces originally impressed upon each planet impelling it in different directions at the same time. But if the tendency of the planets towards the centre of the sun be of the same kind with that of heavy bodies towards the centre of the earth (and if there be such a tendency at all, we have no reason to suppose it different), it cannot possibly be the effect of impulse. A body impelled or projected in vacuo would continue to be moved with an equable velocity, neither accelerated nor retarded as it approached the object towards which it was directed; but the velocity of a body tending towards the centre of the earth is continually accelerated; and as we cannot doubt but that the same thing takes place in the motion of a body tending towards the centre of the sun, that motion cannot be the effect of impulse or projection.\n\nSome of the Newtonians therefore have supposed, \"That all kinds of attraction consist in fine imperceptible particles or invisible effluvia, which proceed from every point in the surface of the attracting body, in all right-lined directions every way; which in their progress lighting on other bodies, urge and solicit them towards the superior attracting body; and therefore (say they) the force or intensity of the attracting power in general must always decrease as the squares of the distances increase.\" The inference is fairly drawn from the fact, provided the fact itself were real or possible: but it is obvious, that if fine imperceptible particles or invisible effluvia were thus issued from every point in the surface of the sun, the earth and other planets could not move in vacuo; and therefore the projectile motion would in time be stopped by the resistance of this powerful medium. Besides, is it not altogether inconceivable, nay impossible, that particles issuing from the sun should draw the planets towards that centre? would they not rather of necessity drive them to a greater distance? To say, that after they have reached the planets, they change their motion and return to the place whence they set out, is to endue them with the powers of intelligence and will, and to transform them from passive matter to active mind.\n\nThese difficulties in the theories of attraction and impulse have set philosophers upon fabricating numberless hypotheses: and Sir Isaac Newton himself, who never considered gravitation as anything more than an effect, conjectured that there might be a very subtile fluid or ether pervading all bodies, and producing not only the motion of the planets, and the fall of heavy bodies to the earth, but even the mechanical part of muscular motion and sensation. Others (t) again have supposed fire, or light, or the electric fluid, to be the universal agent; and some few (u) have acknowledged, that nothing is sufficient to produce the phenomena but the immediate agency of mind.\n\nWith respect to the interpolation of any material fluid, whether ether, fire, light, or electricity, it is sufficient to say that it does not remove any one difficulty which encumbers the theory of innate attraction. All these fluids are elastic; and of course the particles of which they are composed are distant from each other. Whatever motion, therefore, we may suppose to be given to one particle or set of particles, the question still recurs, How is it communicated from them to others? If one body can act upon another at the distance of the ten-thousandth part of an inch, we can perceive nothing to hinder its action from extending to the distance of ten thousand millions of miles. In the one case as well as the other, the body is acting where it is not present; and if that be admitted to be possible, all our notions of action are subverted, and it is vain to reason about the cause of any phenomenon in nature.\n\nThis theory of the intermediate agency of a subtile fluid differs not essentially from the vortices of Des Cartes; which appeared so very absurd to Cudworth, (v) and that with a boldness becoming a man of the first genius Cudworth, and learning, he rejected it, and adopted the platic nature of Plato, Aristotle, and other Greek philosophers. That incomparable scholar observes, that matter being purely passive, the motion of the heavenly bodies, the growth of vegetables, and even the formation of animal bodies, must be the effect either of the immediate agency of God, or the agency of a platic nature used as an instrument by Divine Wisdom. That they are not the effect of God's immediate agency, he thinks obvious from several circumstances. In the first place, They are performed slowly and by degrees, which is not suitable to our notions of the agency of almighty Power. Secondly, Many blunders are committed in the operations of nature, such as the formation of monsters, &c. which could never be were things formed by the immediate hand of God. He is therefore of opinion, that, after the creation of matter, God employed an inferior agent to give it motion and form, and to carry on all those operations which have been continued in it since the beginning of the world. This agent he calls platic nature; and considers it as a being incorporeal, which penetrates the most solid substance, and, in a manner which he pretends not to explain otherwise than by analogy, actuates the universe. He does not look upon it as a being endowed with perception, consciousness, or intelligence; but merely as an instrument which acts under Divine Wisdom according to certain laws. He compares it to art embodied; and quoting from Aristotle, says, \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u1ff7 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u1ff3 \u1f21 \u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd \u1f14\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u1f45\u03c4\u03b9 \u1f21 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f14\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9. If the art of the shipwright were in the timber itself, operatively and effectually, it would there act just as nature doth. He calls it a certain lower life than the animal, which acts regularly and artificially for ends of which it knows nothing. It may be, he says, either a lower faculty of some conscious soul, or else an inferior kind of life or soul by itself, but depending in either case upon a higher intellect. He is aware with what difficulty such a principle will be admitted by those philosophers who have divided all being into such as is extended and such as is cogitative: but he thinks this division improper. He would divide\n\n(t) The several followers of Mr Hutchinson.\n(u) Cudworth, Berkeley, and the author of Ancient Metaphysics.\ndivide beings into those which are solid and extended, and those which have life or internal energy. Those beings which have life or internal energy he would again divide into such as act with consciousness, and such as act without it: the latter of which is this plastic life of nature. To prove that such an instrument is possible, or that a being may be capable of operating for ends of which it knows nothing, he instances bees and other animals, who are impelled by instinct to do many things necessary to their own preservation, without having the least notion of the purpose for which they work. (See Instinct.) He observes, that there is an essential difference between reason and instinct, though they are both the attributes of mind or incorporeal substance: and that therefore, as we know of two kinds of mind differing so widely, there is nothing to hinder us from inferring a third, with powers differing as much from instinct as instinct differs from reason. Mankind are conscious of their own operations, know for what purpose they generally act, and can by the power of reflection take a retrospective view of their actions and thoughts, making as it were the mind its own object. Brutes are conscious of their own operations, but they are ignorant of the purposes for which they operate, and altogether incapable of reflecting either upon their past conduct or past thoughts. Between their intellectual powers and those of man, there is a much greater difference than there is between them and a plastic nature, which acts as an instrument of Divine Wisdom without any consciousness of its own operations. Aristotle, from whom principally the learned author takes his notion of this plastic nature, compares it, with respect to the Divine Wisdom which directs and superintends its operations, to a mere builder or mechanic working under an architect, for the purpose of which the mechanic himself knows nothing.

But if it be possible for the souls of men to be for one instant void of consciousness and intelligence, it follows, that consciousness is not absolutely necessary to those energies and motions by which life is preserved. To this it may be added, upon the best authority,\u2020 Gregory's \"that where animal or vegetable life is concerned, Philosophy there is in every case a different relation between the cause and effect, and seemingly depending upon the concurrence or influence of some farther principle of change in the subject, than what subsists in inanimate matter, or in the causes and effects that are the objects of mechanical and chemical philosophy.\" Now to this principle of vegetable life, without which, in a seed or in a plant, vegetation will neither begin nor continue, though light, heat, air, earth, and water should concur in the utmost perfection, Cudworth expressly compares its plastic nature in the universe. It is so far (says he) from being the first or highest life, that it is indeed the last and lowest of all lives, being really the same thing with the vegetative.\n\nThese arguments, if the phenomena of elective attractions in chemistry be added to them, demonstrate, but we think, the possibility of such a principle: and to those who are inclined to affirm that no such thing can exist, because, according to the description of it given by Cudworth and the ancients, it is neither body nor spirit, in the proper sense of the words; we beg leave to ask in the words of Locke, \"who told them that there is and can be nothing but solid beings which cannot think, and thinking beings that are not extended? which is all that they mean by the terms body and spirit.\" All the Greek philosophers who were not materialists, and even the inspired writers of the Old and New Testaments, constantly distinguish between the spirit and the soul of a man, calling the former sometimes \u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 and sometimes \u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b1, and the latter \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae; and St Paul, who before he was a Chaldean, was learned in philosophy, describes the constituent parts of man as three, \u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b1, \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae, \u03c3\u1ff6\u03bc\u03b1, spirit, soul, and body. This distinction, setting aside the authority with which it comes to us, seems to be well founded; for there are many operations carried on in the human body without any conscious exertion of ours, and which yet cannot be accounted for by the laws of mechanism. Of these, Cudworth instances the motion of the diaphragm and other muscles which cause respiration, and the systole and diastole of the heart; neither of which, he thinks, can be the effect of mere mechanism. But, as we are not conscious of any energy of soul from which they proceed, even while we are awake, and still less, if possible, while we are asleep; he attributes them, not to the intellect or rational mind, but to this inferior vital principle called \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae (v); which, in his opinion, acts\n\n(v) The existence of this plastic nature was warmly debated between Monsieur Le Clerc and Monsieur Bayle. Molheim, who was inclined himself to admit such a principle, gives the following view of Le Clerc's sentiments from Biblioth\u00e8que Choise, tom. ii. p. 113. \"Respiratio, inquit, et motus cordis, actiones sunt, quorum nihil ad animam pertinet. Interim mechanic\u00e6 cas fieri, nullo modo probabile est. In voluminis\nthe same part in the system of the human body which the plastic nature acts in the system of the world.\u2014To make the resemblance more striking, he observes, that even the voluntary motion of our limbs, though it proceeds ultimately from an energy of will, seems to be the effect of that energy employing some instrument which pervades the fins, nerves, and muscles of the body; and if the human spirit or soul employ the instrumentality of a plastic nature or force in moving the small machine of the body, it seems to be far from incredible that the Divine Wisdom should employ the instrumentality of a plastic nature in moving the great machine of the universe.\n\nBut we need not insist further on the possibility of such an instrument. Whatever may be thought of the arguments of Cudworth, of which some are, to say the least of them, plausible, though others appear to us to have very little strength, Dr Clarke has proved, with a force of reasoning not inferior to mathematical demonstration, that the motions of the heavenly bodies are carried on by the agency of something very different from matter, under every possible form. \"For, not to lay that, seeing matter is utterly incapable of obeying any laws in the proper sense of the word, the very original laws of motion themselves cannot continue to take place, but by something superior to matter, continually exerting on it a certain force or power according to such certain and determined laws: it is now evident beyond question, that the bodies of all plants and animals could not possibly have been formed by mere matter according to any general laws of motion. And not only so, but that most universal principle of gravitation itself, the spring of almost all the great and regular inanimate motions in the world, answering not at all the surfaces of bodies, by which alone they can act upon one another, but entirely to their solid contents, cannot possibly be the result of any motion originally impressed upon matter.\" For though it is true, that the most solid bodies with which we are acquainted are all very porous; and that, therefore, a fluid material fluid might penetrate the bodies of the planets, and operate upon them with a force exerted internally; still it is self-evident, that the greatest quantities of such a fluid could not enter into those bodies which are least porous, and where the greatest force of gravitation resides: \"and, therefore, this motion must of necessity be caused by something which penetrates the very solid substance of all bodies, and continually puts forth in them a force or power entirely different from that by which matter acts upon matter.\" Which is, as the same able writer observes, an evident demonstration, not only of the world's being of Nature, and originally made by a supreme intelligent Cause; but moreover, that it depends every moment upon some superior Being, for the preservation of its frame; and that all the great motions in it are caused by some immaterial power perpetually and actually exerting itself every moment in every part of the corporeal universe. This preserving and governing power, whether it be the immediate power and action of the same Supreme Cause that created the world, or the action of some subordinate instruments appointed by him to direct and preside respectively over certain parts thereof, gives us equally in either way a very noble idea of Providence. We know with certainty, that real and original power can belong only to a being endowed with intelligence and will; and, therefore, if the existence of Cudworth's (w) plastic nature be admitted, (and we see not why it should be called\n\ntariis commotionibus neciunt animi nostri, quid facto opus sit, ut membra commoveantur: imperant illi tantum.

The opinion of the last of these philosophers is not essentially different from Cudworth's; and therefore it is needless to quote from him: Berkeley was better acquainted with the principles of the Newtonian philosophy, as well as an abler mathematician.\ncalled in (x) question), it can be considered only as an instrument employed by Divine Wisdom, as a chisel or a saw is employed by the wisdom of the mechanic.\n\nNor let it be imagined, that this ancient theory of motion is in any degree inconsistent with the mathematical principles of Sir Isaac Newton's astronomy, or with the calculations raised from those principles. Having founded his astronomy on analogy between the phenomena of projectile and planetary motions, he assigned the same or similar forces existing in nature as the efficient causes of both. And indeed, both in the act of deriving his principles from the projectile phenomena, and afterwards for the purpose of applying them to the planetary, it was necessary to analyze the elliptical motion of the heavenly bodies into a compound of two simple motions in right lines, produced by the action of these different forces; and this might also be useful for the purposes of teaching and demonstration, just as we find it necessary, in all parts of science, to separate what in nature is inseparable, for the convenience and assistance of the understanding. The planetary motions, however, are very probably simple and uncompounded, for no experiments can be tried in those distant regions; and the astronomy of Newton, which is only the application of his mathematical principles to their mensuration from their analogy to projectile motions, does not at all require that the forces of gravitation and projection be assigned as their real existent causes (v). It is sufficient for the analogy\n\nmatician, than either of these pupils of the ancients; and being likewise a man who on all subjects thought for himself, it may be worth while to lay before our readers a short abstract of his reasoning respecting the origin of motion.

The truth of the opinion itself will be considered in a subsequent chapter.\n\n(y) Indeed Sir Isaac himself is very far from positively assigning them as the real causes of the phenomena. The purpose for which they were introduced into his philosophy he clearly explains in the following words:\n\n\"Eadem ratione qua projecile vi gravitatis in orbem flecti potest et terram totam circumire, potest et Luna...\"\nOf Number.\n\nAnalogy, on which the whole philosophy is founded, that the phenomena of motion are known from experiments and observations to be the same in both instances; that the principles or general laws mathematically established from the forces of the one are transferred to the phenomena of the other; and that the proofs and operations deduced from these principles in the latter case, are confirmed by facts and experience, the first and final test of truth.*\n\n* Tatian's Chart and Scale of Truth.\n\nChap. VI. Of Number.\n\nAmongst all the ideas that we have, as there is none (says Mr Locke +) suggested to the mind by more ways, so there is none more simple, than that of Unity or one. It has no shadow of variety or composition in it. Every object our senses are employed about, every idea in our understandings, every thought of our minds, brings this idea along with it: and therefore it is the most intimate to our thoughts, as well as it is, in its agreement to all other things, the most universal idea we have; or number applies itself to men, angels, actions, thoughts, every thing that either doth exist or can be imagined.\" He seems likewise to be of opinion that we have the idea of unity before that of many; and that it is by repeating the simple idea of unity in our own minds that we come by the complex ideas of two, three, &c. In this opinion he is joined by Pere Buffier *; who observes that it is impossible to explain the nature of unity, because it is the most simple idea, and that which perhaps first occurred to the mind.\n\nThat unity is a simple idea, must be granted; but it certainly did not first occur to the mind, nor can it be abstracted from all individuals, and apprehended in Locke's sense of the word as a general idea. Let any man look into his own mind, and then say whether he has a general idea of one or unity as abstracted from every individual object mental and corporeal. In particular, when he thinks he has completely abstracted it from body and mind, sensations, ideas, actions, and passions, &c., let him be sure, before he pronounces it a general abstract idea, that he is not all the while contemplating the idea of its name, or of that numerical figure, by which it is marked in the operations of arithmetic. Both these ideas are in themselves particular; and become general in their import, only as representing every individual object to which unity is in any sense applicable. But in the chapter of Abstraction, we have laid enough to convince every person capable of conviction that they are used as signs for whole classes of objects.\n\nInstead of being an abstract general idea, unity, as the basis of number, is in fact nothing but a mere relation, which cannot be conceived without the related objects; and so far is it from being the first idea that occurred to the mind, that it is certainly the result of a comparison, made by the intellect, of two or more objects. The ideas which first occur to the mind are, beyond all doubt, those which are called ideas of sensation; and many such ideas every child receives before he is capable of comparing objects and Unity, a forming to himself notions of number. Unity, or the particular idea of one, is indeed the element of the science of arithmetic, just as a mathematical point is the element of the science of geometry; but accurate notions of these elements are, in the progress of knowledge, subsequent to ideas of many and of surfaces. There is reason to believe that persons totally illiterate have no notion at all of mathematical points; and we think it possible to conceive an intelligent and conscious being in such a situation as that he could not acquire a notion of unity or one. Were a child never to see or feel two objects of the same kind, we doubt if he would think of numbering them, or of making such a comparison of the one with the other as would suggest to his mind the relations of one and two; for these relations imply both a sameness and a difference of the objects beyond the power of a child to ascertain. The difference indeed would be perceptible to the senses, but the senses would perceive no sameness or agreement. A guinea, a shilling, and a ball of lead, impress upon the mind different sensations; and therefore a child undoubtedly distinguishes these objects from one another: but what could make him derive from this his first idea of the relation of number? A guinea, a shilling, and a ball of lead, are not one, two, three, in any sense which a child can comprehend. To be convinced of this, let any man throw a guinea, a shilling, and a ball of lead upon a table, and ask a clown what is their number. From being accustomed to retail the names of number as signs, without affixing to them any idea of the things signified, he will probably answer with quickness three, or perhaps one, two, three: but if he be further asked in what respect they are one, two, three, we believe his answer will not be so ready: They are not one, two, three guineas, or shillings, or balls of lead. A philosopher knows them to be three pieces of the same first matter under different forms, and can therefore apply to them the relation of number with truth and propriety; but of the first matter a clown is entirely ignorant, and of course cannot call them one, two, three, in any sense which is at once true and to him intelligible.\n\nTo make it still more evident, that it is only by comparing together things of the same kind that our first ideas of unity and number are formed, let us suppose no created being to have hitherto existed except the animated and intelligent globe mentioned in the last chapter, and we think it will be granted that such a being in solitude could never acquire the idea of unity.\n\nLet\n\nvel vi gravitatis, si modo gravis fit, vel alia quacunque vi qua in terram urgeatur, rethari semper a curvo rectilineo terram versus et in orbem suum flecti: et ab illo tali vi luna in orbe suo retineri non potest. Haec vis, si juxto minor effet, non satis flecteret lunam a curvo rectilineo: si juxto major, plus satis flecteret, ac de orbe terram versus deduceret. Requiritur quippe ut sit juxta magnitudinis: et mathematicorum est invenire vim, qua corpus in dato quovis orbe data cum velocitate accurate retineri possit; et vicissim invenire viam curvilineam, in quam corpus e dato quovis loco data cum velocitate egressum data vi flectatur.\"\u2014Principia.\n\nMathem. Def. V.\nLet us next suppose a cubic body to be created and exhibited to the senses of this spherical man; the consequence would be a sensation or feeling entirely new: but that feeling would not be of unity; for, as the author of Ancient Metaphysics has somewhere well observed, unity is no object of sensation. The sensation would be of colour, hardness, softness, roughness or smoothness, &c., for beyond these the empire of the senses does not reach. Again, let another body be created of a colour and figure totally different from the colour and figure of the cube, and the spherical man would then experience new sensations having no agreement with those which he had formerly felt. These different kinds of sensations might be compared together; but the result of the comparison would not be the ideas which are denoted by the words one and two, but merely that which is expressed by difference or dissimilarity. Were another cube, however, of exactly the same size and colour with the former to be brought into existence, and both to be at once presented to the view of the spherical man, the rudiments of the idea of number would then be generated in his mind, because he could not but perceive the cubes to be in one respect different and in another the same; different as being distinct from each other, and agreeing in their effects upon the organs of sensation.\n\nIt appears, therefore, that mankind must have made some progress in classing things according to their genera and species, before they acquired any correct ideas of the relation of number, or thought of using numerical names or figures as general and discriminating signs: for we say one, two, three, &c., only with respect to the species or genus of which each of the things denoted by these numbers is an individual; and if there be anything which has no genus or species, neither number nor unity can, in the original sense of the words, be predicated of it (z). We say indeed that there is one God; but perhaps we do not always attend to the meaning of the expression. Language was formed to answer the common purposes of life; and those purposes are best answered by denoting individuals by the name of the species or genus to which they belong: but God belongs to no species or genus, unless he be said improperly (A) to be of the universal genus of Being; and therefore the true meaning of the word one, when joined to the verb is, and transferred from the creature to the Creator, in such a sentence as\u2014\"there is one God\"\u2014seems to be nothing more than an affirmation that God exists, and that to him the relation of number cannot be applied. In a word, unity and number are merely relations between the individuals of the same species or genus of being; and men acquire ideas of these relations at the same time and by the same means that they are led to class things into species and genera. As to the processes of addition and subtraction, and the various purposes to which number is applied, these things belong to the science of arithmetic, and fall not under the province of the metaphysician, whose sole object is to ascertain the real nature and causes of things. It may, however, be worth while to observe, that Locke, whose notions of number seem to have been different from ours, owns, that a man can hardly have any ideas of numbers of which his language does not furnish him with names. But if units were either real things, or even positive ideas, we see not how names could be necessary to their existence; whereas, if they be nothing more than mere relations, it is obvious that they cannot be conceived but as relative either to beings actually existing, or to names which are the signs of actual beings.\n\nCHAP. VII. Of Time.\n\nWhen St Augustine was asked what time is? he replied, \"Si non roges, intelligo.\" An answer from which mode of duty it may be inferred, that he thought the nature of time could not be explained by a logical definition. Time and eternity are commonly considered as the two modes of duration; and if duration be taken in what Locke thinks its true and original sense, to denote permanence of existence, with a kind of resistance to any destructive force, the distinction seems to be sufficiently proper. It is indeed the best that we can make or comprehend; for duration, time, and eternity, are subjects which have perplexed philosophical minds in all ages, and of which, if we have adequate notions, it is very difficult to express these notions in language. Instead of attempting it by previous definitions, the method in which the ancients generally began their inquiries, we shall pursue the better course of induction recommended by Lord Bacon, and endeavour to show by what means we acquire the notion of that mode of duration which is called time in contradiction to...\n\n(z) We are happy to find our notions on this subject confirmed by an authority so respectable as that of Professor Stewart. \"Without the power of attending separately to things which our senses present to us in a state of union, we never (says this able writer) could have had any idea of number: for before we can consider different objects as forming a multitude, it is necessary that we should be able to apply to all of them one common name; or, in other words, that we should reduce them all to the same genus. The various objects, for example, animate and inanimate, which are at this moment before me, I may class and number in a variety of different ways, according to the view of them that I choose to take. I may reckon successively the number of sheep, of cows, of horses, of elms, of oaks, of beeches; or I may first reckon the number of animals, and then the number of trees; or, I may at once reckon the number of all the organized substances which my senses present to me. But whatever be the principle on which my classification proceeds, it is evident that the objects numbered together must be considered in those respects only in which they agree with each other; and that if I had no power of separating the combinations of sense, I never could have conceived them as forming a plurality.\" Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind, chap. iv.\n\n(A) We say improperly, because beings which were created can have nothing in common with that Being which is self-existent, and upon whose will and power all other things depend.\nto eternity. We begin with time; because we ourselves exist in it, and it is in some sense familiar to us. If we be able to trace our notions of this mode of duration to their source, we may then give a definition of it founded on fact and universal experience, and afterwards proceed to consider the other mode in conjunction with infinity, to which it is nearly allied.\n\nIt has been already observed (see No. 92 of this article), that every man, while awake, has a train of sensations and ideas constantly passing through his mind in such a manner as that the one succeeds the other in a regular order. It is not possible, either, by detaining in the mind one idea to the exclusion of all others, to stop the course of this succession entirely; or, by hurrying some ideas off the stage, and calling others in their place, to quicken its progress beyond a certain degree. One man indeed has naturally a quicker succession of ideas than another; and all men can, by great exertions, accelerate or retard in a small degree the natural flow of their thoughts. A flustered man lays hold, as it were, of a particular idea, which he wishes to contemplate, and detains it in the imagination, to the exclusion of all others; a man of wit calls remote ideas into view with a rapidity of which a cool and phlegmatic reasoner can form no conception; and a forcible sensation takes full possession of the mind, to the exclusion of all ideas whatever. Whilst the attention is wholly occupied by one idea, or by one sensation, the mind has no notion whatever of time; and were it possible to detain such idea or sensation alone in the mind till the hand of a clock should move from the number of one hour to that of another, the hour, as marked on the dial-plate and measured by the motion of the hand, would appear but as one instant absolutely void of duration.\n\nFor the truth of this assertion we appeal to the experience of our readers. Such of them as have ever been engaged in deep study must often have had their attention so fixed upon one object, that large portions of time, as measured by the clock, have passed away wholly unheeded; and every man who has seen a very striking and uncommon object, must remember, that when the sensation was first impressed upon his mind, all other objects, ideas, and notions, and among the rest the notion of time, were for a while excluded.\n\nNo sensation, however, keeps possession of the whole mind after it has ceased to be new; nor can the most vigorous exertions long preserve any one idea from being driven off the stage by the succeeding train. Now this succession of ideas appearing and disappearing in their turns, is that which, when compared with the permanency of ourselves and other things, gives us our first and juttest notion of time; for whilst we are thinking, or whilst a series of ideas is successively passing through our minds and vanishing, we know that we ourselves and the things around us exist; and this existence, or continuation of existence, commensurate with the train of our fleeting ideas, is what we call the duration of ourselves and the things around us.\n\nWe are aware that our first notions of time have been often said to be derived from motion as perceived by our senses in the objects around us. It is observed by Euclid, that \"if there were no motion, there could be no sound, nor any sense of hearing.\" He might have added (says the author of Ancient Metaphysics), nor any other perception of sense. Further, Without motion there would have been no visible world, nor generation or production of any kind here below; and, among other things, time could have had no existence.\" All this is certainly true; but that corporeal motion, though the original source of all our ideas, is not that which immediately suggests to us the notion of time, will be readily granted by him who considers that motion itself is perceived by us only when it excites or accompanies a concomitant succession of perceptions and ideas. Motion, when equable and very slow, such as that of the hour hand of a common watch, is not perceived by us in its course; nor can we discover that the thing has moved at all, till after we have been sensible of the lapse of a considerable portion of what is commonly called time; when we discover that the hand of the watch has changed its place with respect to other objects which we know to be fixed. The same is true of motion remarkably quick: \"Let a cannon ball (says Locke) pass through a room, and in its way take with it any limb or fleecy parts of a man; it is as clear as any demonstration can be, that it must strike successively the two sides of the room; it is also evident that it must touch one part of the flesh first, and another after, and so in succession: and yet I believe nobody who ever felt the pain of such a shot, or heard the blow against the two distant walls, could perceive any succession either in the pain or sound of so swift a stroke.\"\n\nOf these two phenomena a satisfactory account may be easily given; from which we think it will at the same time be apparent, that the succession of the train of ideas in the mind is the measure and standard of all other successions. We know that the energy of the mind which reviews a train of sensible ideas is of the very same kind with that which attends to a series of passing sensations (see No. 68); and therefore it is natural to suppose that we can pay attention to sensations and ideas passing with nearly equal velocities. But it has been shown, that every sensation remains in the mind or sensorium for a very short space after the object which excited it is taken away: whence it follows, that a body communicating to the organs of sense a series of similar impressions succeeding each other with remarkable rapidity, cannot excite a train of similar and distinct sensations; because the effects of the first and second impressions not having vanished when those of the third and fourth arrive, the whole train of effects must necessarily coalesce into one uniform sensation. This reasoning is confirmed by experience. Similar sounds succeeding each other at considerable intervals, are all distinctly perceived; and if the motion be accelerated gradually, it may be carried to a great degree of velocity before the sounds be confounded and coalesce into one. \"Mr Herschel having, by means of a clock, produced sounds or clicking noises, which succeeded each other with such rapidity that the intervals between them were, as far as could be judged, the smallest possible, found that he could evidently distinguish one hundred and sixty of them in a second of time; but beyond that he could by no effort of attention distinguish one sound from another. The same philosopher tried another experiment on visible sensations. By means of the same handle and work of the clock, he caused a wheel in it to turn till\ntill it acquired the velocity of once in a second. He continued to increase the velocity, and observed it while revolving at the rate of twenty times round in thirteen seconds, and could still distinguish the teeth and spaces from each other; whence it appears (by a computation given at length), that he had two hundred and forty-five distinct visible sensations generated by equable motion in a second of time. The teeth of the wheel, he owns, were not so far visible as to show their shape distinctly, much less could they have been counted: but he very plainly distinguished the circumference to be divided into teeth and spaces; and he supposes that the same division might still have been seen though the motion had been a little faster, as far perhaps as two turns in a second, equal to three hundred and twenty sensations.* The reason that the Treatise on division could not be seen whilst the wheel moved more rapidly than twice round in a second of time, was doubtless the continuance of that agitation in the brain from which each sensation proceeded, until a new impression caused a new agitation, which coalesced with the former and removed all distinction. Hence it is plain, that no external succession can be perceived which moves with a greater velocity than that of which the internal train of sensations and ideas is capable. On the other hand, an external succession which moves with less rapidity than that to which the internal flow of ideas may be reduced, either has not sufficient force to generate sensations at all, or the successive impressions from which the sensations proceed follow one another at such distances as to permit the natural train of ideas to intervene between them, and thus destroy the perception of the succession entirely.\n\nTo us, therefore, it seems evident, that the constant and regular succession of ideas in the mind of a waking man, is the measure and standard of all other successions; of which, if any one either exceeds the pace of which our ideas are capable, or falls short of it, the sense of a constant and continued succession is lost, and we perceive it not but with certain intervals of rest between. So that it is not motion, but the constant train of ideas in our minds, that suggests to us our first notion of time; of which motion no otherwise gives us any conception, than as it causes in our minds a constant succession of sensations; and we have as clear a notion of time by attending to the train of ideas succeeding each other in our minds, as by a train of sensations excited by constant and perceptible motion.\n\nThat it is merely by comparing the permanent existence of things with the fleeting succession of ideas in our own minds that we acquire our notions of time, may perhaps be still more evident from the following narrative quoted by Dr Beattie\u2020, from L'Histoire de l'Academie Royale des Sciences pour l'ann\u00e9e 1719.\n\n\"A nobleman of Lausanne, as he was giving orders to a servant, suddenly lost his speech and all his senses. Different remedies were tried without effect. At last, after some surgical operations, at the end of six months, during all which time he had appeared to be in a deep sleep or delirium, his speech and senses were suddenly restored. When he recovered, the servant to whom he had been giving orders when he was first seized with the distemper, happening to be in the room, he asked whether he had executed his commission, not being sensible, it seems, that any interval of time, except perhaps a very short one, had elapsed during his illness.\" If this story be true, here was a man, who, by the train of ideas vanishing at once from his mind, lost the perception of what was to others six months of time; and had all mankind been in his state, the same portion of time would have been irrecoverably lost even to the annals of chronology.\n\nWe are aware of an objection to any inference which may be drawn respecting the present question from the case of this nobleman. It may be said, that he had lost, together with the perception of time, the perception of every thing besides; and that, therefore, motion may still be the cause from which a waking man derives his notions of time. But in reply to this objection, we beg leave to ask, Whether if a ball had been put in motion on a table, and the nobleman had been told, that a body moved with the velocity of that ball would have been carried over so many thousand miles of distance during the time that he lay in a state of insensibility, he could from such information alone have formed any tolerable notion of the length of time in which he was insensible? He certainly could not, for want of a standard by which to measure the rapidity of the motion. He would, indeed, have known instantly that he had been insensible for a considerable length of time, because he had the evidence of former experience that a body carried by perceptible motion over a great extent of distance would have generated in his mind a vast train of successive sensations; but till he had attended this ball during part of its course, and compared with the permanency of other objects the series of sensations which it generated in his mind, he would not have been able to guess with any thing near to accuracy the length of time it would take to pass over a thousand miles.\u2014The same insensibility of duration happens to every man in sound sleep. From having notions of time, such as they are, formed in our minds, we never indeed suppose, however fondly we have slept, that the moment at which we awake in the morning is contiguous to that in which we fell asleep at night. The reason is obvious; every man has been awake whilst others were sleeping, and has known by experience, that if they had been awake likewise a train of ideas would have passed through their minds which must have suggested to them the notions of time. Most men, too, have been frequently awake whole nights, and have thus acquired a notion of time as going on incessantly, whether perceived by them or not; and this notion being closely associated with our ideas of night and morning, we inevitably suppose a portion of time to have elapsed between them, though unperceived by us in our sleep. But were a man to sleep without dreaming from Sunday night till Tuesday morning, and then to awake at his usual hour as marked on the clock, there are numberless instances on record to convince us, that he would not of himself suppose, nor perhaps be very easily persuaded, that more than one night had elapsed between his falling asleep and the moment at which he awoke.\n\nIt being thus evident, that our notion of time is suggested by that comparison which we inevitably make of the existence of things permanent with the train...\ntrain of ideas incessantly passing through our minds; we may now perhaps be able to answer the question, \"What is time?\" It must of necessity be one of three things, viz. either the ideal succession itself; a certain quality inherent in all objects; or merely the relation of coexistence between things that are permanent and the trains of fleeting ideas which succeed each other on the theatre of the imagination. It is not the first of these; for in every train of thought, the appearance of any one idea in the mind occupies no more of the extension of time, than a mathematical point occupies of the extension of distance. Ten thousand mathematical points added together would make no part of a line; and ten thousand ideas made to coalesce, if that were possible, would occupy no part of that mode of duration which is called time. A point is the boundary of a line, but no part of it; the appearance of an idea in the mind is instantaneous; and an instant is the boundary, but no part of time. Hence it follows, that were everything instantaneous like ideas in a train, there could be no such thing as time, since nothing could be said to have in that sense of the word any duration. That time is not a quality inherent in all objects, is likewise plain; for we have seen, that were ideas as permanent as objects, the notion of time could never have been acquired. Succession, though it does not itself constitute time, is essential to its existence; and were all motion to cease, and the attention of men to be immovably fixed upon one invariable object or clutter of objects, time would cease likewise. It remains, therefore, that time can be nothing else than the relation of coexistence apprehended between things that are permanent and those trains of fleeting ideas which incessantly succeed each other on the theatre of the imagination. Thus whilst a man is steadily looking at one object, which, from its being common, does not occupy his whole mind, he may be conscious of a thousand ideas starting up in his imagination, and each in its turn vanishing the instant in which it appeared. Every one of these ideas had an existence as well as the object at which he is looking; but the existence of each of them was instantaneous and in succession, whilst the existence of the external object is permanent. The object, therefore, as contrasted with the train of ideas, is said to endure or to exist in time, whilst each idea is destitute of duration, and exists in no time.\n\nTo this theory some objections occur, which it will be incumbent upon us to obviate. It may be said, that though each idea considered by itself is instantaneous, and occupies no time; yet the whole train when taken together, without being compared with anything external, is perceived to occupy a considerable portion of that mode of duration; and that, therefore, time itself must be something more than a mere relation between a fleeting succession of ideas and objects of more permanent existence. But how, we beg leave to ask, is the whole train perceived to occupy any portion of time? Is it not by being compared with our own existence? A man, whilst a train of ideas is passing through his mind, may be suddenly deprived of all his external senses, and then indeed it will be impossible for him to compare the fleeting existence of this internal succession with the more permanent existence of external things; but, whilst he thinks at all, he must be conscious of his own existence, and cannot avoid perceiving, that whilst his ideas pass in constant succession, each making an instantaneous appearance in his mind, he himself remains unchanged. Now, what is it that this perception suggests to the mind? Evidently nothing more than the relation of coexistence between a fleeting succession and a permanent object; for were it possible that the man could be deprived of memory as well as of his senses, and still have ideas succeeding each other in his mind, he would then think all objects equally fleeting; he would indeed be himself a mere succession of instantaneous distinct persons, and could have no notion whatever of time. His existence, though it should seem to endure half a century as estimated by others, must to himself appear to pass away like a flash of lightning.\n\nIt may be still further objected to our theory, that time is measured by motion; and that it seems very absurd to talk of measuring a relation, especially a mere ideal relation, by a real external thing. In answer to this objection, which at first sight appears formidable, we beg leave to observe, that all relations are equally ideal; and that yet many of them may be said to be measured by real external things, with as much propriety as time can be said to be measured by motion. When a man wishes to ascertain the relation of quantity which one body bears to another, though he knows that such a relation has no other than an ideal existence, and cannot be conceived but in conjunction with the related bodies, he applies to them successively some common standard; and having discovered the relation which each bears to that, he compares the one relation with the other, and thus ascertains the relation sought. Just so it is with respect to motion measuring time. That which to each individual constitutes real time, is the relation of coexistence between the fleeting succession of his own ideas and other things of a more permanent nature. But a man has often occasion to ascertain the time of things external which fall not under the inspection of his senses; and in society all men have transactions with one another to be performed in some determinate portion of time, though there are not, perhaps, two men existing whose ordinary trains of thought flow with precisely the same rapidity. To remedy these inconveniences, it was necessary to invent some common standard, by means of which men might ascertain the duration of actions performed at a distance, and be able to keep appointments made with each other. The only standard proper for these purposes is such a constant and equable motion as has suggested a flux of perceptions common to all men in all ages and countries; and hence the motions of the heavenly bodies have been universally made use of for the common regulators of time. These motions, however, do not constitute real and natural time, any more than a foot or a yard applied to two distant bodies constitutes the relation of quantity which these bodies bear to each other. They are merely stated measures, to be differently applied according to the different purposes which we have in view.\n\nThus, if a man in Europe wishes to know what would to him have been the real and natural time of an action performed in the East Indies, he has only to be told, that it was co-existent, we shall suppose, with\nChap. VIII. METAPHYSICS.\n\nOf Time. With a diurnal revolution of the earth; and by comparing this common measure with his usual flow of thought, he can form some notion of the extent of that train of ideas, which, had he been present, would to him have been successively co-existent with the action in question. But when persons have an appointment to keep, this common measure of motion must be differently, or rather partially, applied. In such cases, it is no part of their intention to compare their own existence with that of the whole train of ideas which may pass in the mind of each; for the result of such a comparison, which alone constitutes true and natural time, would not be the same in perhaps any two men: but their purpose is, to compare their own permanent existence only with that train of sensations which shall be excited in the mind by the perceptible motion of the sun, or any other body fixed upon which moves equably; and such a train must consist of an equal number of instants in all men. Neither the sun, nor the hour hand of a common watch, moves with such apparent rapidity as to keep pace with the internal flow of thought of which the most phlegmatic man is conscious. That these bodies move at all, is known only by their visible change of place during the lapse of a considerable portion of real time; and as there is in their course a certain number of places distinctly marked, to which alone it is agreed that the attention is to be turned, it is impossible that of time so computed two men can have different notions. Such time, however, is but partial; and the method of ascertaining it, when compared with that by which we ascertain real time, has a striking resemblance to that by which we ascertain the relation of partial quantity between two distant bodies. When it is our purpose to ascertain the relation of real quantity which one body bears to another, we apply the common standard to each in every dimension of length, breadth, and depth; but when we have no other view than to ascertain the relation of length which the one bears to the other, we apply the common standard to each in that dimension only. Just so it is with regard to real and partial time. When an individual wishes to ascertain what would to him have been the duration of any action which he did not see performed, he applies the common standard to the existence of that action, and to the usual flow of his own thoughts: but when two men talk of the duration of any action, or agree to meet on such a day, they compare the existence of the action, or the distance intervening between the present moment and the day of meeting, only with that partial train of sensations which by the common standard is generated in an equal number, and in the same order, in the minds of both.\n\nIt will be said, that if time be nothing more than a mere relation subsisting between trains of ideas or other fleeting objects, and things of a more permanent existence; and if the universe had a beginning; either time must have had a beginning likewise, or the Deity cannot be immutable. We allow the force of the argument; but instead of an objection, we consider it as a confirmation of the truth of our theory. The Deity, who is immutable, exists not in time, but in eternity; and that these, though from the poverty of language they are both called modes of duration, are yet very different from each other, we shall endeavour to prove in the next chapter.\n\nChap. VIII. Of Infinity and Eternity.\n\nAs corporeal substance is certainly not infinite, and why we as the present material system has in itself every evidence of its not being eternal, it may seem strange, perhaps, to the reader, that we should treat of infinity among the and eternity among the adjuncts of body. But in adjuncts of modern metaphysics these words are used in a vague sense to denote the extent of space and time; and in this chapter it is our intention to do little more than ascertain their meaning, and to show, in opposition to some celebrated names, of what subjects they may not be predicated. There is a mathematical and a metaphysical infinity, which, though often confounded, ought to be kept distinct. In mathematics, extension is said to be divisible ad infinitum, and number is sometimes considered as infinite: but in metaphysics these modes of expression are extremely improper. A positive and metaphysical infinite is that which has no limits, and to which no addition can be made; but it is obvious that there is no number which may not be enlarged, nor any positive idea of extension which has not limits, and which may not be either increased, or diminished. The infinity of the mathematician is termed infinity of power, and that of the metaphysician absolute infinity. The first consists in this, that a being, however great or small it be supposed, may still be conceived to possess more greatness or minuteness than we can form an idea of, even after the utmost stretch of human thought. Thus when it is said, that all extension as such is infinitely divisible, it is not meant that every extended substance contains an infinite number or real parts; for then the parts of an inch would be equal to those of a league: but the meaning is, that in ideal extension we can never reach the end of ideal division and subdivision. In like manner, when it is said that number is infinite, the meaning is not that any positive number is without limits, or the possibility of increase, but that we might go on for ever, adding unit to unit, without approaching nearer to the end of the process. If, therefore, the mathematician would speak properly, and without the affectation of paradox, he ought to say that all extension as such is indefinitely divisible, and that unit might be added to unit without end; but these phrases suggest notions very different from that of a metaphysical infinite, which is something positive to which nothing can be added (B).\n\nThat there is something positively infinite, has been very seldom questioned; but it has been warmly disputed among metaphysicians what subjects are infinite, the one infinite, and the other eternal:\n\n(V) \u039f\u1f50 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u1f41 \u03bc\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f36\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u1fbd \u1f41 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u1ff7 \u1f10\u03be\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff7, \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6. Arist. Phys. Anschl. lib. ix. cap. 9; page 492.\nDr Clarke and his adherents have contended that space and time are real things; that they are both of necessary existence; that the former impresses us with the idea of its infinity, and that the latter is positively eternal. \"Time and space (says the doctor *) are the fine qua non of all other things, and of all other ideas. To suppose either of them finite, is an express contradiction in the idea itself. No man does or can possibly imagine either of them to be finite; but only either by non-attention or by choice he attends perhaps to part of his idea, and forbears attending to the remainder. They who suppose space to be nothing but a relation between two bodies are guilty of the absurdity of supposing that which is nothing to have real qualities: For the space which is between two bodies is always unalterably just what it was, and has the very same dimensions, quantity, and figure, whether these or any other bodies be there or any where else, or not at all. Just as time or duration is the same, whether you turn your hour-glass or no, or whether the sun moves or stands still, or whether there was or was not any sun, or any material world at all. To let bounds to space is to suppose it bounded by something which itself takes up space, and that is a contradiction; or else that it is bounded by nothing, which is another contradiction. To suppose space removed, destroyed, or taken away, amounts to the absurd supposition of removing a thing away from itself; that is, if in your imagination you annihilate the whole of infinite space, the whole of infinite space will still remain; and if you annihilate any part of it, that part will still necessarily remain, as appears by the unmoved situation of the rest; and to suppose it divided or divisible amounts to the same contradiction.\"\n\nThe absurdity of considering space as a real external thing has been already evinced in Chap. IV. p. 624, where it was shown how we acquire the notion, and what kind of notion it is. Space, as was there observed, may be conceived either as the mere absence and possibility of body; or as ideal extension, united to, and inhering in, an ideal substratum. Taken in the former sense, it is an object of pure intellect; in the latter, it is an idea or form in the imagination. That the absence of body or matter is the fine qua non of all other things, and all other ideas, Dr Clarke was not disposed to affirm, when he made the divine sufficiency, to pervade every material atom in the universe; and to talk of the absence of body being infinite is a palpable contradiction, unless Berkeley's doctrine be true, that the material world has no existence. To say that the possibility of matter is infinite, is to use language which has no other meaning than that, however far the material world be on all sides extended, its extension may still be conceived greater and greater ad infinitum. This is a position which no philosopher ancient or modern has ever denied; but it is so far from implying that we have a positive idea of the infinity of the material world, or of any adjunct of the material world, that it is absolutely inconsistent with such infinity. Whatever is capable of perpetual increase must certainly have limits, and every new addition is the limit of that to which the addition was made.\n\nTaken in the second acceptation as an ideal extension united with an ideal substratum, space is so far from being infinite in any sense of the word, that we will venture to assert no man ever contemplated such a form in his own imagination, without conceiving it to be bounded. Of this, at least we are certain, that when we have attempted to frame a positive idea of pure space, it has not been in our power to divest that idea of limits. Those who can frame in their minds real and positive ideas wholly abstracted from every individual object, may indeed perform in this way many feats above our abilities; but as we possess no such powers of abstraction, every thing which we can call an idea is limited in the same manner that the object itself is limited from which the idea was derived.\u2014Thus, the largest expansion that ever we beheld is the concave hemisphere; and when we try to form the largest positive idea of pure space, all that we can do is to figure to ourselves that concave empty of body. We may, indeed, suppose its diameter to be either a million or ten thousand millions of miles; and we may go on enlarging it ad infinitum: but when we return from this process of intellect to the contemplation of the ideal forms of the imagination, none of these forms appear to us larger or more extended than the hemisphere, which is the object of sense, and they all appear to be bounded, and bounded in the very same way.\n\nWith respect to the eternity of time, we think Dr Clarke equally mistaken as with respect to the infinity of space. Of time, indeed, we cannot, properly speaking, have any idea or mental form. Time, as we have time been seen, is a mere relation, and is in itself the creature of the mind which has no external datum. It is suggested, however, by the fleeting succession of our ideas, compared with the more permanent existence of other objects; and therefore succession is essential to it. But nothing which has parts, whether coexistent or in succession, can be positively infinite. For, \"in an infinite series of successive generations of men, for instance, there will be several infinities that are parts of one another; and by consequence one greater than another: which (as has been well argued *) is an express contradiction, since the greater must necessarily bound the less, and exceed its limits by so much as it is greater than it; that is, must make it not infinite.\" Infinite generations contain an infinitely greater infinity of particular men. An infinite number of men must have twice as many hands, and ten times as many fingers, and so on. Infinite time has an infinity of ages; these a much greater infinity of years, days, translation hours, &c. Space likewise (according to Dr Clarke) of King's has three dimensions, all infinite. It must therefore contain an infinity of surfaces, an infinitely greater infinity of lines, and a still infinitely greater infinity of physical points. The case is the same in number itself, which, if we suppose it to contain an absolute infinity of thousands (and we may as well do that as imagine it to comprehend an infinity of units), it will contain ten times as many hundreds, fifty times as many scores, and so on. All this is only the indefiniteness of number, which we in vain attempt to turn into a positive infinite with which it is totally incompatible. For let us add one to any of these infinite series of generations, ages, lines, or numbers, which we know to be always in our power, and if it was absolutely infinite before, here is one more than infinite. If it only becomes infinite now, then one finite added to another finite makes infinity. If it be no larger af-\nOf Infinity and Eternity.\n\nThe usual reply to the foregoing reasoning shown\n\nTo this kind of reasoning Dr Clarke replies as follows: \"To endeavour to prove that there cannot possibly be any such thing as infinite time or space, from the impossibility of an addition of finite parts ever composing or exhausting an infinite; or from the imaginary inequality of the number of years, days, and hours, that would be contained in the one; or of the miles, yards, and feet, that would be contained in the other, is supposing infinites to be made up of numbers of finites; that is, it is supposing finite quantities to be aliquot or constituent parts of infinite, when indeed they are not so, but do all equally, whether great or small, whether many or few, bear the very same proportion to an infinite, as mathematical points do to a line, or lines to a superficies, or as moments do to time, that is, none at all. No given number or quantity can be any aliquot or constituent part of infinite, or be compared at all with it, or bear any kind of proportion to it, or be the foundation of any argument in any question concerning it.\"\n\nIf it be indeed true, and it is that for which we contend, that no given number or quantity can be any aliquot or constituent part of infinite, or be compared at all with it; then it undeniably follows, not that miles, yards, and feet, are no constituent parts of space; or years, days, and hours constituent parts of time; but that space and time cannot possibly be positive infinites. This, we say, follows undeniably: for nothing is more evident, than that all quantities of the same kind, from the largest to the least, bear a certain proportion to each other; and upon the supposition that space is a real extending thing, miles, yards, and feet are included in it, and bear to it the relation of parts to a whole. The same is true of time, days, and hours. To affirm (for no proof is offered), that all finite quantities, whether great or small, whether many or few, do equally bear the very same proportion to an infinite, as mathematical points do to a line, or as moments do to time, is plainly to beg the question\u2014\n\n\"that space considered as a real extended thing is infinite?\" and to beg it, too, in opposition to the common sense and reason of mankind. Mathematical points we all know to be nothing real, but merely negations of extension; but supposing space to be something real and extended, can any man persuade himself that a mile or a million of miles of this space is likewise a mere negation of extension? With him who can bring himself to this persuasion, we pretend not to argue. He is possessed of faculties, whether true or false, of which we are destitute.\n\nThat finite quantities, whether great or small, do all equally bear the same proportion to an infinite in power, is indeed true; but it is no great discovery: for such an infinite, as we have seen, is nothing but the continued possibility of repeating the same mental process of addition or multiplication; and he who can go on for ever adding, in his own imagination, foot to foot, or hour to hour, will find it equally easy to add, in the same manner, league to league, or age to age. Of Infinity and Eternity.\n\nIf he can perform the one operation, he must likewise have power to perform the other; and he cannot but perceive that it is as impossible to come to an end, of adding league to league, or age to age, as of adding foot to foot, or hour to hour; but then he must know that these leagues, feet, ages, and hours, are not real external things, but mere ideas and notions in his mind. If such powers of ideal multiplication and addition be what Dr Clarke means by the ideas of space and time, it is indeed a contradiction to suppose either of them limited; for that is to suppose our powers different from what we know them to be by consciousness and experience. But to confound powers with the objects of those powers, is certainly very inaccurate; and to suppose, because we can go on for ever adding one portion of ideal space or time to another, that therefore our ideas of space and time are in themselves positively infinite, is a contradiction: for to an idea positively infinite, it is obvious that nothing can be added. Either, therefore, space and time do not impress us with the ideas of their positive infinity; or we cannot have the power of adding league to league, and age to age, without end.\n\n\"But (says the doctor), to suppose space removed, destroyed, or taken wholly away, amounts to the absurd supposition of removing a thing from itself; that is, if in your imagination you remove the whole of space, the whole of space will still remain.\" True, every man has ideas of space treasured up in his imagination, which the sound of the very word space will at all times bring into his immediate view; and whilst he has such ideas, it is impossible that he should not have them; which is all the mystery of the matter, and amounts to nothing more than that a thing cannot be and not be at the same instant. When the doctor affirms, that if \"you annihilate any part of space, that part will necessarily remain,\" as appears by the unmoved situation of the rest, we are not certain that we perfectly understand him. A man may surely think of a cubical inch without thinking of a foot or a yard; and he may suppose the inch taken away from the foot or the yard, and these ideal quantities so much lessened by the subtraction. But if the doctor be here again confounding the powers of the mind with the positive ideas of space, the sentence when explained will be seen to contain nothing to his purpose. Every man has the power of contemplating in idea millions of miles, and millions of ages, and of adding mile to mile, and age to age, without end; and if he try to deprive himself of any part of this power, or to fix a limit to the mental process of addition, he will find that in spite of himself his imagination will ramble beyond the limit assigned, and that he has attempted an impossibility. This, however, is so far from being a proof that his ideas of space and time are positively infinite, that, as we have already observed, it is a proof of the contrary.\n\nBut (says this great man and his followers) \"space and time are the fine qua non of all other things; and time are all other ideas. The supposal of the existence of any, said to be thing whatsoever includes necessarily a presupposition of the fine qua non of all existence of space and time;\" and therefore, if there be other any thing infinite and eternal, space and time must things; but likewise be so.\nTo every corporeal substance, and every idea of such substance, space and time are indeed necessary: for every body has extension and duration; and every idea of a particular body, being nothing but a secondary perception in the imagination or memory, must have the same relation to imaginary extension, that the object from which it was derived has to extension which is real. Every idea, too, which remains in the imagination whilst a train of other ideas passes successively in view, or whilst external things are perceived to change, has real time. But will any man say that consciousness, our notion of power, our acts of willing, or even taste, sound, and smell, are extended, or that the supposition of their existence necessarily implies a presupposition of the existence of space? We acquire our ideas of extension and space by means of our senses of touch and sight; and we learn from experience, that things external and extended are the causes of our sensations of taste, sound, and smell. The effects are in our minds closely associated with the ideas of their causes; and it is not perhaps easy to think of a particular sound, taste, or smell, without at the same time thinking of the object by which it was at first excited in the mind; but had we been originally formed with the powers of consciousness, thinking, and willing, and with no other senses than those of tasting, smelling, and hearing, it is obvious that we never could have had the idea of space; and therefore, that idea cannot possibly be necessary to the presupposition of every thing else. To consciousness, thinking, and willing, space is so far from being necessary, that we cannot perceive any thing whatever between them. It is not more difficult to conceive a part greater than the whole, than it is to conceive an ell of consciousness, of thought, or of will; nor is it in the power of any man to make space and sweetness coalesce in his mind so as to form of the two simple ideas one complex conception. The very reverse is the case with respect to the objects of sight and touch. The idea of every thing which we see and handle necessarily coalesces in the mind with the idea of space, nor can we possibly separate the one from the other; but the things which we see and handle are neither infinite nor capable of infinity.\n\nWith respect to time, the same observations will be found to be just as with respect to space. Whatever is liable to change, exists in time and cannot be eternal; but if there be any being immutable, and who views at once all things which to us are past, present, and to come, the existence of that being is not commensurable with time. That such a being is possible no man can doubt, who reflects, that if we had one permanent idea invariably in the mind, we should never have acquired the notion of succession or of time; and that if there were actually no change in nature there could not possibly in nature be any such thing as time. Every man, therefore, who can conceive existence without change, must be convinced, that \"the supposition of the existence of any thing whatever does not necessarily include the presupposition of the existence of time;\" and that there may be an eternity distinct from time, as well as an infinity distinct from space; nay, that nothing which is properly infinite and eternal can possibly occupy either space or time.\n\nIf it be asked, What kind of infinity and eternity they are which have no relation to space and time? Cudworth, treading in the footsteps of the ancients, has long ago answered, That they are \"absolute perfection, and necessary existence.\" For (says he), infinite understanding and knowledge is nothing else but perfect knowledge, which hath in it no defect or mixture of ignorance, but knows whatsoever is knowable. In like manner, infinite power is nothing else but perfect power, which hath in it no defect or mixture of impotency\u2014a power which can do every thing which is possible or conceivable. Lastly, Infinity of duration, or eternity, is really nothing else but perfection, as including in it necessary existence and immutability; so that it is a contradiction to suppose such a being to have had a beginning, to cease to be, or to suffer or be affected by any change whatever. And because infinity is perfection, therefore nothing which includes in its idea or essence any thing of imperfection, as every positive idea of number, corporeal magnitude, and successive duration, evidently does, can be truly and properly infinite.*\n\nIt must indeed be confessed, that the idea of succession so intimates itself into our usual ideas of existence, and is so closely connected with the existence of all finite beings, that we find it extremely difficult to imagine the eternal existence of God, any otherwise than as an eternally continued series or succession. Our constant conversation with material objects, and the associations thence arising, make it almost impossible for us to consider things abstracted from time and space; yet we have the evidence of experience and consciousness, that an idea may be conceived without relation to space and time, and that space and time cannot be made to coalesce with some of our notions. The same must be true with respect to infinity and eternity; for we have seen that neither space, time, nor any thing else which consists of parts, whether continuous or successive, can be supposed to be positively infinite, as the supposition implies the most palpable contradiction. But that there may be perfect power, perfect knowledge, and permanent invariable existence, is so far from implying any contradiction, that even we, whose faculties are so very narrow, can yet make some advances towards the conception of such perfections. Thus, every man of common understanding knows that some things are in themselves possible, and others impossible, to be performed by any power. Of these possibilities and impossibilities a philosopher knows more than an illiterate man; and one philosopher knows more than another. An intellect more perfect knows more of them than any man; and that intellect which knows them all must be absolutely perfect, and incapable of improvement, because it knows every thing which is to be known. The same is true of perfect power;\u2014but we shall treat of real infinity and eternity more at large when we come to demonstrate the being and attributes of God. At present it is sufficient to have shown that nothing can be positively infinite but a being absolutely perfect; which never was not, which can produce all things possible and conceivable, and upon which all other things must depend.\n\n* Intellec-\ntual System.\nPART III. OF MINDS AND THEIR POWERS.\n\nCHAP. I. Of Mind in General.\n\nThe science of metaphysics comprehends everything, into the existence, nature, or causes of which any inquiry may be made. But all things of which we have any notion or idea may be divided into mind and body, with their various powers, qualities, and adjuncts. By body is meant that which is solid, extended, inert, and divisible; and its several adjuncts are space, motion, number, and time. The only mind with which we are intimately acquainted is our own; and we know that it is possessed of the powers of sensation, perception, retention, consciousness, reflection, reason, and will. These are totally different from extension, solidity, divisibility, and motion; and therefore it is proper to distinguish the being of which they are powers by another name than that of body.\n\nOf bodies there are various kinds possessing various sensible qualities; and from analogy it is reasonable to conclude, that there may be various classes of minds endowed with different kinds or degrees of power. For this indeed we have stronger evidence than that of analogy. Brute animals evidently possess the powers of perception and spontaneity with some degree of consciousness; but as they appear not to reflect upon their own conduct, or to have their actions influenced by motives, their minds are inferior to ours, though still perfectly distinct from mere extended, inert, and divisible substances. Mind, therefore, considered with respect to its powers, is evidently different from body considered with respect to its qualities. This is indeed a truth which has seldom if ever been controverted; but it has been long and warmly disputed, whether mind and body be not both composed of the same first matter?\n\nHobbes supposed, that every material atom is endowed with the faculty of sensation (c); but that for want of memory each sensation is momentaneous, being instantly and wholly effaced as soon as its cause is removed. Though this hypothesis is too absurd to require a formal and laboured confutation, it may not be improper to observe, that, if it were true, the hairs of a man's head would feel extreme pain when pinched by the hot iron of the hair-dresser; and that the nails of his fingers would be severely tortured when under the operation of the knife or the rasp.\n\nOthers have supposed that each atom of matter has a tendency towards sensation and perception; and that when a sufficient number of these atoms are brought together in a certain order, the united tendencies produce the actual powers which distinguish mind from gross body. This supposition is if possible more absurd than that of Hobbes. Sensation and perception are of such a nature, that a mere tendency towards them is inconceivable. A thing must either be sensible and percipient, or insensible and inert; there is evidently no medium. Or if we could suppose each individual atom to have a tendency towards sensation, it would by no means follow that a number of such atoms brought together in any possible order would become one sentient, thinking, and active being. A number of bodies laid upon an inclined plane have each a tendency to roll downwards; but if the declivity of the plane be not such as that their separate tendencies may overcome the resistance opposed to each individual body by friction, the united tendencies of all the bodies when brought together will not be able to overpower the resistance of their united frictions. Just so is it with respect to sensation and perception: If the tendency of one atom cannot overcome one degree of inertness, the tendency of a thousand atoms will not overcome a thousand degrees of the same inertness.\n\nWe have just mentioned these absurd suppositions only two that our article might be complete; but it is proper opinions at to inform the reader, that, so far as we know, neither of them has for these many years been maintained by any philosopher of eminence either at home or abroad. The opinions on this subject, which at present divide the republic of letters, are two; and these alone are worthy of examination. One party maintains, That perception, memory, reason, and will, &c., are the powers of a being which must be immaterial and indivisible: The other alleges, That as we know nothing of these powers but from our own consciousness, and as we can trace them in ourselves to the brain and no farther, we have no reason to suppose that they are the powers of any substance distinct from matter. Both parties, however, distinguish that which in man is the subject of thought from his external organs of sense, and agree to call it by the name of mind; though the one considers it as composed of the same first matter with the dust of the ground; whilst the other believes it to have no property whatever in common with that matter.\n\nWere we to adopt some of the ancient methods of philosophizing, this important question might be soon decided. A most respectable writer, who has laboured to restore the metaphysics of Plato and Aristotle, hopes to confute the materialists, by laying down what they must think arbitrary definitions of mind and matter, and then showing that the one is not the other.\n\n---\n\n(c) Scio fuisse philosophos quosdam, eoquemque viros doctos, qui corpora omnia sensu praedita esse sustinerent: Nec video, si natura sensationis in reactione sola collocaretur, quomodo refunari possit. Sed etiam ex reactione etiam corporum aliorum, phantasma aliquod faceretur; illud tamen, remoto objecto, natim celaret. Nam nisi ad retinendum motum impressum, etiam remoto objecto, apta habent organa, ut habent animalia; ita tantum fient, ut nunquam sensibile se recordentur. Sensioni ergo, quae vulgo ita appellatur, necessario adhaeret memoria aliqua.\n\nHobbes's Physic, cap. xxv. sect. 5.\nIn all the parts of the material world (says he) there is a perpetual motion: For the celestial bodies move constantly in one respect or another; and all here below is in a continual vicissitude of generation and corruption, which cannot be without motion. Now, where there is motion, there must be something that moves: What is moved I call body; what moves I call mind.\" From this definition he undertakes to prove, that mind must be immaterial. \"That there is a relation between moving and being moved (says he), nobody can deny; and the relation is no other than that of action and passion. But the nature of relation is such, that it must necessarily be between two things at least; and it is further necessary, that the two things related should exist together. Hence, if there be that which moves, there must be a different thing that is moved; and wherever the one is, the other must necessarily be; so that nothing can move itself. This being established, I say that what moves must be either material or immaterial; for the one of these being the negation of the other, there can be no middle between them; because a thing must necessarily be, or not be. If then it be immaterial, there is an end of the question: but if it be said to be material, then I say that it must be moved itself before it can move any thing else; for it is only in that way that body can move body. If then it must be first moved itself, but cannot itself move itself, what is it that moves itself? If it be answered, That it is another material mover, then I repeat the same question, to which the same answer must be given: and so we have an infinite series of material movers, without any beginning or principle of motion. Now this is absurd, and contradictory to this first principle of natural philosophy, admitted by all philosophers ancient and modern, That nothing can be produced without a cause.\n\nFor the immateriality of the human mind, and of every being endowed with the powers of perception and thought, the learned writer has better arguments; but it is upon this chiefly that he rests his persuasion, that mind is the only mover in the universe. It is needless to observe, that in the very definitions and axioms upon which this reasoning is built, the thing to be proved is taken for granted: for if it be self-evident, that what moves is, in the author's sense of the word, mind, that what is moved is body, and that nothing can move itself, all reasoning on the subject is superfluous. This, however, is so far from being self-evident, that a materialist may reply, \"every animal moves itself, and yet every animal is nothing more than a system of matter.\" This position, whether true or false, can neither be proved nor confused by arguments a priori founded on general definitions. That animals move themselves, and that to the senses they appear to be nothing else than systems of matter, are facts which cannot be controverted. If we would know whether they have in them a principle of motion which is not material, we must submit to the laws of induction (see Logic); and by investigating the essential qualities of matter, endeavour to ascertain whether a material system can be rendered active. That we ourselves have active powers, we know by the most complete of all evidence, viz. consciousness of their proper energies; and it has been already shown, that such investigatory powers as we experience in ourselves cannot exist but tinged in a subject possessed of will and understanding. The nature of question therefore to be first decided between the materialists and immaterialists is, Whether the powers of consciousness, understanding, and will, can result from the particular organization of a system of matter? If they can, we have no reason to attribute them in man to any other source: if these powers appear necessarily to require an immaterial principle for their support, it will probably be granted, that an immaterial principle is the source of every power and every motion in the universe; and the doctrine of mind, in the strictest sense of the word, will be sufficiently established.\n\nChap. II. Of the Substance of the Human Mind.\n\nThe most celebrated materialist of this or perhaps any other age is Dr Priestley; who having in his own imagination divested matter of solidity, and reduced it to mere centres of attraction and repulsion, observes, that \"if one kind of substance be capable of supporting all the known properties of man; that is, if those properties have nothing in them that is absolutely incompatible with one another; we shall be obliged to conclude (unless we openly violate the rules of philosophizing, which will not authorize us to multiply causes or kinds of substance without necessity), that no other kind of substance enters into his composition; the supposition being manifestly unnecessary, in order to account for any appearance whatever.\u2014All the properties that have hitherto been attributed to matter, may be comprised under those of attraction and repulsion. Besides these, man is possessed of the powers of sensation or perception, and thought. But if, without giving the reins to our imaginations, we suffer ourselves to be guided in our inquiries by the simple rules of philosophizing above mentioned, we must necessarily conclude, that these powers also may belong to the same substance that has also the properties of attraction, repulsion, and extension (D), which I as well as others call by the name of matter. The reason of the conclusion is simply this, that the powers of sensation or perception and thought, as belonging to man, have never been found but in conjunction with a certain organized system of matter; and therefore that those powers necessarily exist in and depend upon such a system. This at least must be our conclusion, till it can be shown that these powers are incompatible with the\n\n(D) When Dr Priestley mentions the extension of corporeal substance, it must be remembered that he does not mean the extension of any real thing possessed of an independent existence. The extension belongs wholly to the sphere or the combination of spheres of attraction and repulsion. The centre itself, which attracts and repels, he repeatedly affirms not to have the dimensions even of a physical point; and he sometimes seems to entertain a doubt whether it be anything more than a mere relative notion.\nThis is what Dr. Priestley calls the proper and direct proof that the sentient principle in man is the material substance of the brain; and he enforces it by the following observations: \"Had we formed a judgement concerning the necessary seat of thought by the circumstances that universally accompany it, which is our rule in all other cases, we could not but have concluded that in man it is a property of the nervous system, or rather of the brain; because, as far as we can judge, the faculty of thinking, and a certain state of the brain, always accompany and correspond to one another; which is the very reason why we believe that any property is inherent in any substance whatever. There is no instance of any man retaining the faculty of thinking when his brain was destroyed; and whenever that faculty is impeded or injured, there is sufficient reason to believe that the brain is disordered in proportion; and therefore we are necessarily led to consider the latter as the seat of the former. Moreover, as the faculty of thinking in general ripens and comes to maturity with the body, it is also observed to decay with it; and if, in some cases, the mental faculties continue vigorous when the body in general is enfeebled, it is evidently because in those particular cases the brain is not much affected by the general cause of weakness. But, on the other hand, if the brain alone be affected, as by a blow on the head, by actual pressure within the skull, by sleep, or by inflammation, the mental faculties are universally affected in proportion. Likewise, as the mind is affected in consequence of the affections of the body and brain, so the body is liable to be reciprocally affected by the affections of the mind, as is evident in the visible effects of all strong passions, hope or fear, love or anger, joy or sorrow, exultation or despair. There are certainly irrefragable arguments, that it is properly no other than one and the same thing that is subject to these affections, and that they are necessarily dependent upon one another. In fact, there is just the same reason to conclude, that the powers of sensation and thought are the necessary result of a particular organization, as that found is the necessary result of a particular concurrence of the air. For in both cases equally the one constantly accompanies the other; and there is not in nature a stronger argument for a necessary connexion of any cause and any effect. To adopt an opinion different from this, is to form an hypothesis without a single fact to support it.\"\n\nThough the ingenious author thinks, that if there be any foundation for the established rules of philosophizing, this reasoning ought to be conclusive, he yet submits, for the greater satisfaction of his readers, some additional arguments, or rather, as he says, distinct illustrations of the great argument. They are as follow:\n\n1. \"That the faculty of thinking necessarily depends, for its exercise at least, upon a stock of ideas, about which it is always conversant, will hardly be questioned by any person. But there is not a single idea of which the mind is possessed but what may be proved to have come to it from the bodily senses, or to have been consequent upon the perceptions of sense. The notion, therefore, of the possibility of thinking in man, without an organized body, is not only destitute of all evidence from actual appearances, but is directly contrary to them; and yet these appearances ought alone to guide the judgement of philosophers.\n\n2. \"The only reason why it has been so carefully contended for, that there is some principle in man that is not material, is, that it might subsist, and be capable of sensation and action, when the body is dead. But if the mind was naturally so independent of the body, as to be capable of subsisting by itself, and even of appearing to more advantage, after the death of the body; it might be expected to discover some signs of its independence before death, and especially when the organs of the body were obstructed, so as to leave the soul more at liberty to exert itself; as in a state of sleep or swooning, which must resemble the state of death; in which it is pretended that the soul is most of all alive, most active, and vigorous. But judging by appearances, the reverse of all this is the case.\n\n3. \"If the mental principle was, in its own nature immaterial and immortal, all its particular faculties would be so too; whereas we see that every faculty of the mind without exception is liable to be impaired, and even to become wholly extinct, before death. Since, therefore, all the faculties of the mind, separately taken, appear to be mortal, the substance or principle in which they exist must be pronounced to be mortal too.\n\n4. \"If the sentient principle in man be immaterial, it can have no extension; it can neither have length, breadth, nor thickness; and consequently every thing within it, or properly belonging to it, must be simple and indivisible. Let us now consider how this notion agrees with the phenomena of sensation and ideas. It will not be denied, but that sensations or ideas properly exist in the soul, because it could not otherwise retain them, so as to continue to perceive and think after its separation from the body. Now, whatever ideas are in themselves, they are evidently produced by external objects, and must therefore correspond to them; and since many of the objects or archetypes of ideas are divisible, it necessarily follows, that the ideas themselves are divisible also. But, how is it possible that a thing (be the nature of it what it may) that is divisible, should be contained in a substance, be the nature of it likewise what it may, that is indivisible? If the archetypes of ideas have extension, the ideas which are expressive of them, and are actually produced by them according to certain mechanical laws, must have extension likewise; and therefore the mind in which they exist, whether it be material or immaterial, must have extension also. But how anything can have extension and yet be immaterial, without coinciding with our idea of mere empty space, I know not.\"\n\nTo the argument, which is here chiefly insisted on as being agreeable to the established rules of philosophizing, a very able reply has been made, which we shall give in the words of its elegant and spirited author. But before we attempt to dig up the foundation of the doctor's system, it may not be improper to demolish, if possible, the additional buttresses by which it is strengthened. An experienced general, before he form a citadel which he knows to be strongly\nOf the Subtly fortified and skilfully defended, will take care to raze every less important redoubt from which the enemy might annoy him in his rear.\n\nBecause the faculty of thinking in general ripens, comes to maturity, and decays with the body, and the body on the other hand is affected by the affections of the mind, the doctor affirms that we have the same reason to conclude, that the powers of sensation and thought are the necessary result of a particular organization, as that sound is the necessary result of a particular conciliation of the air. This argument is conclusive only upon the supposition that there is no positive evidence whatever for the immateriality of the being which is the subject of thought. If the other reasonings for the materiality and immateriality of the mind be of equal weight, this argument ought doubtless to turn the balance; but if there be the smallest preponderancy in behalf of the immaterialists, it is a mere begging of the question to attempt to counteract it by any inference which can be drawn from the mutual affections of the body and mind. If two such heterogeneous beings as an immaterial mind and an organized body can be supposed united in one person, they must necessarily affect each other; and to affirm, on account of this reciprocal affection, that they are one and the same, is equally absurd as to say that an electrician and his apparatus are one and the same. Dr Priestley himself did not at first perform his electrical experiments with so much ease as after he had acquired facility by long practice, nor could he even yet perform them so neatly with a bad as with a good apparatus.\n\nThat which the doctor calls the first illustration of his argument might be admitted, and the force of the argument itself be confidently denied. Some kind of organized body may be necessary to the mind as an instrument without which it could not exert its faculties; but it would certainly be rash to infer that the mind must therefore be a system of matter. An anvil and a hammer are necessary to the exercise of the blacksmith's art; but what would be thought of him who should from this fact conclude, that the blacksmith himself must be a system of iron? This, therefore, instead of illustrating the great argument, seems to be wholly foreign from the question in debate; and it has in fact been admitted by Dr Price, and thousands of others who reject the doctrine of materialism, as an impious absurdity. The second illustration, however, is more to the purpose; and as it is not new, we shall give it an old answer.\n\nWhy do we not perceive external objects in our sleep or in a swoon? Because (says Mr Wollaston), the passages become impracticable, the windows delineated shut, and the nerves being obstructed, or somehow rendered for the time useless, can transmit no information to it. Why, however, does it not reason and think about something or other? Because, all the marks by which things are remembered, being for the present choked up or disordered, the remembrance of those objects about which it is wont to employ itself, and even of the words (or other signs) in which it uses to reason, and to preserve the deductions and conclusions it makes, is all suspended at least for the time; and so its tables being covered, its books closed, and its tools locked up, the requisites for reasoning are wanting, and no subject offers itself to exercise its thoughts, it having yet had little or no opportunity to take in higher objects and more refined matter for contemplation. And, to conclude, if it be demanded, Why any one should imagine that the soul may think, perceive, act, after death, when it doth not do this in sleep, &c.? the answer is, Because those enclosures and impediments which occasioned the forementioned intermissions, and those great limitations under which it labours at all times, will be removed with its enlargement out of the body. When it shall in its proper vehicle be let go, and take its flight into the open fields of heaven, it will then be bare to the immediate impressions of objects: And why should not those impressions which affected the nerves, that moved and affected the vehicle and soul in it, affect the vehicle immediately when they are immediately made upon it, without the interpolation of the nerves? The hand which feels an object at the end of a staff, may certainly be allowed to feel the same much better by immediate contact without the staff.\"\n\nThe opinion, that the soul is united to some fine vehicle, which dwells with it in the brain, and goes off with it at death, was not peculiar to Mr Wollaston. It was thought extremely probable by Dr Hartley, and shall be shown afterwards to have been a very ancient opinion; but we do not quote it at present as either well or ill founded, but only as sufficient, in conjunction with the reasoning of its author, to obviate the force of Dr Priestley's second illustration of his argument for the materiality of mind, provided the argument itself be not more powerful than any which the immaterialists can bring against it.\n\nThe doctor's third illustration we have already obviated, when we accounted for the mind and the body mutually affecting each other; and we might refer to Dr Price's answer (e) to the fourth, as being, in our opinion, a full confutation of it. But as that author's notions of mind and ideas differ in some respects from our own, we shall examine this objection to the doctrine of the immaterialists upon principles which we believe Dr Priestley more inclined to admit.\n\nThat the sentient principle in man, if it be immaterial,\n\n(e) In Diligentia, p. 37 and 102, it is asserted, that ideas are certainly divisible. \"This seems to me very absurd. It would be as proper to assert ideas to be hard or round. The idea of an object is the apprehension, view, or notion of it; and how can this be divisible? Perception is a single and indivisible act. The object perceived may be divisible; but the perception of it by the mind cannot be so. It is said in page 95, that if ideas are not things distinct from the mind, a mind with ideas and a mind without ideas would be the same.\u2014I maintain, that ideas are not distinct from the mind, but its conceptions; or not things themselves, but notions of things. How does it follow from hence, that a mind with or without ideas is the same? It would seem that this follows much more from the contrary assertion.\" Correspondence between Dr Price and Dr Priestley.\nOf the Sub-terial, can have no extension, is a truth which we\nthink cannot be controverted; and if so, every thing\nin that principle must be simple and indivisible. Thus\nfar we agree with Dr Priestley; but with respect to\nwhat follows we differ from him entirely. The agi-\ntation in the brain, which is the immediate cause of\nsensation, must indeed correspond to the impression\nab extra by which it is produced, and therefore must\nhave the property of extension; but that agitation,\nwhatever it be, is not itself sensation any more than\na bludgeon is a blow, or a sword is a wound. Dr\nPriestley, indeed, in answer to Dr Price, affirms, that,\naccording to Hartley's theory, ideas are only vibra-\ntions in the brain; but whoever shall take the trouble\nto examine that theory himself, will not find that its\nauthor ever advances such an opinion, or considers\nvibrations as anything more than the instruments by\nwhich sensations and ideas are excited in the sentient\nprinciple. A real and proper idea, as we have often\nrepeated, is nothing else than a fainter sensation: but\nno sensation, from whatever cause it may proceed, is it-\nself extended; nor could we, without memory, the\nreasoning faculty, and the power of local motion, have\nacquired from mere sense any notion of extension at\nall: (see sect. 3, Chap. I.) Sensations and ideas\nare those appearances (if we may so say), which vibra-\ntions or some other motion in the brain excite in the\nmind; but a half appearance is an absurdity. A man\nmay view half a tree with his eyes, and he may con-\ntemplate the idea of half a tree in his mind; but he can-\nnot have half a view or half an idea of any thing. Sen-\nsations and ideas result from the mutual agency of the\nbrain and sentient principle upon each other; and if\nthe agency of the brain be vibration, more of it may\nvibrate at one time than at another: but surely the\nmere relation between its agency at any time and the\nagency of the mind, can neither have extension nor\nbe divisible; for who ever thought of extending or\ndividing relations? On this subject it is extremely\ndifficult to write with perspicuity and precision; and\nwhat we have said may very possibly be misunderstood.\nOur notion is to ourselves clear and determinate; but\nlanguage, which was not invented by metaphysicians,\nwants words in which it may be properly expressed.\nPerhaps the reader may understand what we mean,\nwhen we say that a sensation or an idea is the instantane-\nous effect of the mutual agency of the brain and\nsentient principle. Of this we think every man, by\na little attention, may be perfectly convinced, though\nit may be impossible ever to discover the precise na-\nture of this agency; and if so, it is plain that sen-\nsations and ideas cannot be divided, for no instantaneous\neffect of any kind is divisible. A sensation, and of\ncourse a simple and original idea, neither has extension\nitself, nor suggests the notion of extension ab extra.\nBy running the hand or any other member along a so-\nlid body, we feel continued resistance: this feeling, or\nthe idea of this feeling, becomes in time so closely asso-\nciated with all our sensations of touch and sight, that\nthe one cannot be separated from the other; and these\nassociations are what Dr Priestley calls extended ideas.\nUpon the whole then, we think it apparent, that our\nsensations, and the relics of our sensations, are unex-\ntended and indivisible (r); and that though they sug-\ngest\n\n(r) We affirm this only of human sensations and ideas, because these are the only sensations and ideas of\nwhich we are conscious, and about which we can reason. Other animals are sentient as well as man, and\nappear to have their sensations excited by impressions ab extra; but whether in every species of ani-\nmals a single impression excites but one sensation common to the whole animal, or different sensations\nwhich are felt each by a different faculty or sentient principle, is a question which we are not able to answer.\nWe make this remark, because from the phenomena of sensation in the earthworm and other reptiles, some\nphilosophers of eminence having supposed, that in these creatures the sentient faculty belongs to the mate-\nrial system, and is divisible with it; have thence concluded, we think rashly, that all arguments for the\nimmateriality of the human mind are founded merely on our ignorance. We call this conclusion rash; be-\ncause, though we know perfectly what a human sensation is, we have so little knowledge of the nature of\nsensation in worms, that what may be true of the one principle of sensation may be false of the other.\nIndeed, if we are to judge from the phenomena, this is actually the case. It appears from experiments made\nby Abbe Spallanzani and others, that if a certain number of rings be cut off either from the anterior or\nposterior part of a worm, or even from both, the remainder will not only continue to live and be sentient,\nbut will also regenerate a new head and a new tail, and become again a complete worm. Nothing like this takes\nplace in man or in the higher orders of animals; and therefore, were it certain that the sentient principle in\nthe worm is diffused through the whole system, and divisible with it, we could not infer that the principle\nof such sensations as we are conscious of, is likewise extended and divisible. It is, however, so far from being\ncertain that the sentient principle is diffused through the whole worm, that nothing necessarily follows from\nthis fact, but that its seat is at some distance from either extremity. Nay, were it true, as perhaps it is,\nthat a worm may be so divided, as that each of the two sections shall retain life, sensation, and this repro-\nductive power, we would not therefore be authorized to conclude that the sentient principle is one coex-\ntended and divisible with the material system. The earthworm, like many other reptiles, being an herma-\nphrodite, which unites in itself both sexes, may possibly consist of two animated systems; which, though unit-\ned by some bond of connexion, by which sensation is communicated from the one to the other, are yet in\nthemselves perfectly distinct. Should this, upon proper investigation, be found to be the case; and should it\nlikewise be found, that when a worm is divided into three or more parts, only one or two of these parts con-\ntinue to live, there would be no room whatever for supposing that even in these creatures the principle of sen-\nsation is extended and divisible. In the mere power of reproducing amputated parts, when that power is\nconsidered by itself, there is nothing more wonderful than in the growing of the nails of our fingers, or the\nhairs\nMetaphysics\n\nOf the Substance of the Human Mind.\n\nHaving thus examined Dr Priestley's auxiliary arguments for the materiality of mind, we now proceed to consider his main and direct proof. To this, as we have observed, so able a reply has been made, that it would be injurious to our readers not to lay it before them, in the words of its author. \"I readily acknowledge (says this spirited essayist*), that the power of sensation or perception never having been found but in conjunction with a certain organized system of matter, we ought, as philosophers, to conclude that this power necessarily exists in, and results from, that organized system, unless it can be shown to be incompatible with other known properties of the same substance. On the other hand, it must be admitted, that constant conjunction implies necessary connexions only when reasons cannot be discovered to prove the conjunction to be accidental and arbitrary. In the present instance, it is alleged, that discrepantibility is a property of matter absolutely incompatible with the property of sensation or perception; or in other words, that sensation is a power or property incapable of division. But as the power of the entire system is clearly nothing more than the sum or aggregate of the powers of all the parts, it necessarily follows, that the primary particles of which the system is composed must, upon the material hypothesis, possess distinct powers of sensation; and that those powers combined constitute the indivisible power principle in sensation belonging to the system; or, in other words, that the indivisible power of sensation is a divisible power, nay, an infinitely divisible power, if matter be as philosophers in general allow, an infinitely divisible substance\u2014a conclusion obviously and grossly ridiculous. We are then compelled to acknowledge, that sensation or perception is not the property of a material substance; i.e., if the common mode of expression be retained, it is the property of an immaterial substance; or, to avoid verbal contention, it is a property not resulting from, or necessarily connected with, the organical system, but a property wholly foreign, superinduced, and adventitious (G).\n\nIn hairs of our heads. The only thing which seems to militate against the simplicity of the principle of sensation in worms, is the continuance of life, &c., with both parts of a worm when cut into two by a knife or pair of scissors; but if a worm be found to have two feats of sensation analogous to the brain in higher animals, and if it be likewise found that life continues only in such sections as retain at least one feat of sensation, the sentient principle in the worm may be as simple and indivisible as in any animal whatever. We neither nor expect much stress to be laid upon these hints and conjectures. Should they induce any of our physiological readers, who have leisure, and are at the same time skilled in philosophy, properly to called, to institute a set of experiments upon worms and such reptiles, and to trace apparent effects to their higher causes, they might eventually lead to important discoveries. In the mean time, it is sufficient for our purpose to observe, that whatever be the sentient principle or principles in the earthworm, it is obvious that the whole animal cannot in any case be conscious, as man undoubtedly is, of one individual sensation; and that therefore no arguments built upon the phenomena accompanying sensation in worms, can be of any importance in the controversy about the materiality or immateriality of the human mind.\n\n(G) This argument is not new. It was long ago urged by Dr Clarke against Mr Dodwell; and some of our readers may not be ill pleased to see it stated by so masterly a reasoner: \"That the soul cannot possibly be material, is demonstrable from the single consideration of bare sense or consciousness. For matter being a divisible substance, consisting always of separable, nay of actually separate and distinct parts, it is plain that unless it were essentially conscious, in which case every particle of matter must consist of innumerable separate and distinct consciousnesses, no system of it, in any possible composition or division, can be an individual conscious being. For suppose three or three hundred particles of matter, at a mile or any given distance one from another, is it possible that all these separate parts should in that state be one individual conscious being? Suppose then all these particles brought together into one system, so as to touch one another, will they thereby, or by any motion or composition whatsoever, become one whit less truly distinct beings than they were when at the greatest distance? How then can their being disputed in any possible system make them one individual conscious being? If you will suppose God by his infinite power superadding consciousness to the united particles, yet still these particles being really and necessarily as distinct beings as ever, cannot be themselves the subject in which that individual consciousness inheres; but the consciousness can only be superadded by the addition of something, which in all the particles must still itself be but one individual being. The soul, therefore, whose power of thinking is undeniably one individual consciousness, cannot possibly be a material substance.\" Clarke's Letter to Mr Dodwell, 2d edition.\n\nThat the same mode of reasoning was known to the ancients, Cudworth has shown by numerous quotations; and as an argument certainly loses nothing by antiquity, or by having occurred to thinking men in distant ages, we shall lay before our readers two passages from Plotinus, of which the extract from Clarke's letter (though we are persuaded it was not borrowed by the author) must be considered as little more than a paraphrastic translation.\u2014\u03c4\u1fc7 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd, \u1f45\u03c4\u03b9 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03b9\u03ba\u1f78\u03bd \u03c3\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1 \u03b5\u1f36\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03c3\u03b8\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9, \u03c0\u03c1\u1ff6\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03bc\u1f72\u03bd \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u1f10\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f14\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9 \u03c4\u1ff7 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1ff7 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff7, \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f78\u03bd \u1f30\u03b4\u03af\u03c9\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd, \u1f22 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5;

\u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\nIn opposition to this reasoning, the materialists affirm that entire systems may possess, and they think themselves warranted to pronounce that organized systems of matter actually do possess powers essentially different from those which inhere in the several parts. Amongst various familiar though striking illustrations of this truth, it has been said, that a rose possesses the property of sweetness or fragrance, a globe the property of sphericity, a harpsichord the property or power of producing harmony, aqua regia the property of dissolving gold, &c., though the component particles of these different organized systems are themselves totally destitute of the powers and properties here enumerated.\n\nThe immaterialists, in reply, assert that it is not only false in fact, but a direct contradiction, and an absolute impossibility in the nature of things, that a system should possess any property which does not inhere in its component parts. To assert that the power of the whole is the sum or aggregate of the powers of all the parts, is an identical and self-evident proposition, the whole and all the parts being terms precisely synonymous. Whoever, therefore, calls in question the truth of this axiom, must maintain that the power of the whole is something different from the power of all the parts, i.e., that the power of the whole is not the power of the whole.\n\nIt will be easy to demonstrate the correspondence of facts with this plain and simple theory. For this purpose, it is necessary to observe, that the properties of matter, or what are generally denominated such, may be divided into real and nominal, which Locke and others have called primary and secondary qualities. Figure, magnitude, and motion, are qualities really inherent in matter; but figure, magnitude, and motion, externally varied, can produce only different combinations of figure, magnitude, and motion. There are also powers, or qualities, vulgarly considered as inherent properties of matter organically disposed, which are really and truly qualities or affections of the mental or percipient principle, and have no existence when not perceived. Thus the sweetness or fragrance of the rose, considered as mere sweetness and fragrance, can be nothing but an affection of the mind; considered as a quality of the rose, they can mean nothing more than a certain arrangement, configuration, and motion of parts, which in some inexplicable manner produces the sensation of sweetness. In this instance, therefore, the power of the whole is plainly the aggregate of the powers residing in the parts, by the motion and organization of which a certain effect is produced upon a foreign and percipient substance.\n\nBut a globe, we are told, possesses the property of sphericity, though not a single particle amongst that infinite number of which the globe is constituted is itself of a spherical form. The fallacy of this illustration is, however, as easily demonstrable as that of the former. The sphericity of a globe is evidently the sum or aggregate of the curvilinear or convex parts which compose its surface; and the property of the whole is neither more nor less than the combined properties of all its parts. No one doubts, that by new compositions or arrangements of material particles possessing magnitude, figure, and motion, an endless diversity of phenomena may be produced, to which it may be necessary to apply new names. New names, however, do not constitute the substance of an entire system, and although we give to a globe the name of sphericity, we know at the same time that it is really nothing more than a collection of thousands of millions of particles, actually separate and distinct, arranged in that particular form which we denominate spherical. But this can never be regarded as in the remotest manner analogous to the creation of the power of perception, in consequence of a certain organic arrangement or disposition of imperceptible particles. Though sphericity is, indeed, the property of the entire sphere, yet every part of the sphere, if divided, possesses its share of sphericity. But if the percipient principle be divided, what would become of the power of perception? A sphere equally divided becomes two hemispheres; does a perception, when divided in like manner, become two demi-perceptions?\n\nThe same reasonings may easily be transferred, and applied to the harpsichord. Can any one be absurd enough to affirm that the power of harmony resides in the harpsichord, as the power of perception does in the mind? After the utmost skill of the artificer has been exerted, we discover nothing more in the harpsichord than new modifications of the old properties of figure, magnitude, and motion, by means of which certain vibrations are communicated to the air, which, conveyed by the medium of the auditory nerves to the sensorium, produce the sensation of harmonic sounds. These new modifications are therefore attended, indeed, with new and very wonderful effects; but then those effects are produced upon, and are themselves modifications of, the sentient or percipient faculty. And though it is wholly incomprehensible to us in what manner these effects, that is, these sensations, are produced, we well know, and perfectly comprehend, that they are not new powers belonging to any organized system of matter; that they have no existence but in a mind perceiving them; and that they are far from militating against that grand and universal axiom, that the power of the whole is nothing more than the united powers of all the parts.\n\nAs to the last instance adduced, of the power of aqua regia to dissolve gold, though neither the spirit of salt, nor the spirit of nitre of which it is compounded, separately possesses that power, it is plain, that from the union of these two substances, certain new modes of configuration and motion result; and the solution of gold is the consequence of this new arrangement and motion of the parts. But the particles of which the menstruum is composed were always possessed of the properties of figure and motion; and what is styled a new property, is clearly nothing more than a new effect of the old properties differently modified. In a word, the advocates for materialism may safely be challenged to produce, in the whole compass of nature, a case which bears the least analogy to that which these instances are most unphilosophically adduced to prove and to illustrate. It is an absurdity which transcends itself does not exceed, to maintain that a whole is in reality anything different from its component parts; and all nature rises up in contumely of an assertion so monstrous and extravagant. To affirm that perception can arise from any combination of imperceptible particles, is as truly ridiculous, as to affirm\nthat a combination of the seven primary colours with the four cardinal virtues may constitute a planet. It is equivalent to an assertion, that an epic poem might be composed of parallelograms, cones, and triangles. In a word, it is an absurdity not less real, and little less obvious, than that of the blind man who thought that the idea of a scarlet colour resembled the sound of a trumpet.\n\nIf a matter be taken in the common acceptation, to be a solid, extended, and inert substance, this reasoning for the immateriality of the sentient principle in man appears to us to have the force of demonstration, which no difficulties or partial objections, arising from our inability to conceive the bond of union between two such heterogeneous substances as mind and body, can ever weaken, and far less overturn. But the modern materialists deny that matter is either solid or inert. \"All those facts (say they) which led philosophers to suppose that matter is impenetrable to other matter, later and more accurate observations have shown to be owing to something else than solidity and impenetrability, viz. a power of repulsion, which for that reason they would substitute in its place. The property of attraction or repulsion (says Dr Priestley) appears to me not to be properly what is imparted to matter, but what really makes it to be what it is; inasmuch, that without it, it would be nothing at all; and as other philosophers have said, 'Take away solidity, and matter vanishes,' so I say, 'Take away attraction and repulsion, and matter vanishes.'\" If this be admitted, the ingenious author hopes that we shall not consider matter with that contempt and disgust with which it has generally been treated, there being nothing in its real nature that can justify such sentiments respecting it.\n\nWe know not why, upon any hypothesis, matter should be viewed with contempt and disgust. Whether penetrable or impenetrable, every consistent theist considers it as one of the creatures of God, perfectly fitted to answer all the purposes for which it was intended; but were it really destitute of solidity, and endowed with the powers of attraction and repulsion, we should still be obliged to consider it as incapable of the powers of sensation and thought. If we have any notion at all of what is meant by centres of attraction and repulsion (of which indeed we are far from being confident), it appears to us to be intuitively certain, that nothing can be the result of any possible combination of such centres, but new and more enlarged spheres of attraction and repulsion. But surely consciousness, sensation, and will, are as different from attraction and repulsion, as a cube is from the sound of a trumpet, or as the sensations of a felon in the agonies of death are from the attraction of the rope by which he is hanged. If this be admitted, and we are persuaded it will be denied by no man whose understanding is not clouded by an undue attachment to paradoxes, the sentient principle cannot possibly be matter: for if, when the powers of attraction and repulsion are taken away, matter vanishes; and if consciousness and sensation are not attraction and repulsion; it is not more evident that three and two are not nine, than that the substance which attracts and repels cannot be that which is conscious and percipient.\n\nLocke, who was certainly no materialist, as he repeatedly affirmed, and indeed demonstrated, that thought could never be the result of any combinations of figure, magnitude, and motion, was yet of opinion, that God by his almighty power might endow some systems of matter with the faculties of thinking and willing. It is always with reluctance than we controvert the opinions of so great a man; and it is with some degree of horror that we venture in any case to call into question the power of Omnipotence. But Omnipotence itself cannot work contradictions; and it appears to us nothing short of a contradiction, to suppose the individual power of perception inhering in a system which is itself extended and made up of a number of separate and distinct substances. For let us suppose such a system to be six feet long, three feet broad, and two feet deep (and we may as well suppose a system of these dimensions to be percipient, as one that is smaller), then it is plain, that every idea must be extended, and that part of it must be in one place, and part in another. If so, the idea of a square inch will be six feet long, three feet broad, and two feet deep; and what is still harder to be digested, the several parts of this idea will be at a great distance from each other, without any bond of union among them. The being which apprehends one extremity of the idea, is, by the supposition, six feet distant from the being which apprehends the other extremity; and though these two distinct beings belong to one system, they are not only separable, but actually separated from each other as all the particles of matter are. What is it then that apprehends as one the whole of this extended idea? Part of it may be apprehended by one particle of matter, and part of it by another; but there is nothing which apprehends, or can apprehend, the whole. Perhaps it will be said, the power of apprehension is not divided into parts, but is the power of the one system, and therefore apprehends at once the whole idea. But a power or faculty cannot be separated from its subject, power which inheres in nothing being confessedly impossible; and a material system is not one subject in which any individual power or faculty can inher. There must, therefore, be united to the system some one being, which is the subject of thought, and which is unextended as well as indivisible. This, we say, follows undeniably. For, let us suppose, that an extended being without separable parts is possible, and that such a being is percipient; it is obvious, that the whole of any one of its perceptions could not be in one place. Now, though we should grant to Dr Priestley and other materialists, that every idea of an extended substance has itself three dimensions, and is incorporated and commensurate with the whole percipient system; what, upon this supposition, shall we think of consciousness and of the perception of truth? Is consciousness or truth extended? If so, one side or surfaces of consciousness, or of a truth, may be greater or less than another, above or below, to the right or to the left; and it will be very proper and philosophical to speak of the length, breadth, and depth, of consciousness or of truth. But surely to talk of the place, or the extension of these things, is as absurd as to talk of the colour of sound, or the sound of a triangle; and we might as well say, that consciousness is green or red, as that it is an ell or an inch long;\nThis reasoning is somewhat differently stated by Cudworth; who observes, that if the soul be an extended substance, \"it must of necessity be either a self-subsistent point of extension or else must consist of more such points joined together. As for the former of these, it is impossible that one single atom, or least point of extension, should be able to perceive distinctly all the variety of things, i.e. take notice of all the distinct and different parts of an extended object, and have a description or delineation of the whole of them upon itself (for that would be to make it the least, and not the least, possible extension at the same time): Besides, to suppose every soul to be but one physical point, or the least possible extension, is supposing such a potential difference in matter or extension, so that some of its parts thereof shall be naturally devoid of all life, sense, and understanding; and others again, naturally sensitive and rational. And even should this absurdity be admitted, it would yet be utterly inconceivable how there should be one, and but one, sensitive and rational atom in every man; how this atom of so faulted dimensions should actuate the whole system; and how it should constantly remain the same from infancy to old age, whilst all the other parts of the system transit perpetually, and are succeeded by new matter (ii).\n\n\"But if, according to the second hypothesis, souls be extended substances consisting of many points one without another, and all concurred in every sensation; then must every one of these points perceive either a point only of the object, or else the whole. Now, if every point of the extended soul perceives only a point of the object, then is there no one thing in us that perceives the whole, or that can compare one part of the object with another. On the other hand, if every point of the extended soul perceive the whole object at once, then would there be innumerable perceptions of the same object in every sensation; as many indeed, as there are points in the extended soul. And from both these suppositions it would alike follow, that no man is one singly percipient person, but that in every man there are innumerable distinct percipients or persons; a conclusion directly contrary to the infallible evidence of consciousness (1).\"\n\nCogent as these arguments for the immateriality of\n\n(II) Should it be said, that this essential difference between the atoms of matter is not fortuitous; that some of them are created intelligent for the express purpose of animating systems of others which are unintelligent; and that these intelligent atoms do not operate upon the systems with which they are united, by the vis inertiae, solidity, or extension, of matter, but by the energies of understanding and will: Should this (we say) be alleged, surely it may be asked, for what purpose they are conceived to have the quality of extension? It is evidently of no use; and it has been already shown, and shall be more fully shown afterwards, that by our notions of consciousness and understanding, we are so far from being led to suppose the subject of these powers extended, that we cannot suppose any relation whatever between them and extension. But if these intelligent atoms be divested of their quality of extension, they will be transformed from matter to mind, and become the very things for the existence of which we plead.\n\n(1) As the materialists endeavour to prejudice the public against the motion of an unextended soul, by representing it as a fiction of Descartes, altogether unknown to the ancients, it may not be improper to give our readers an opportunity of judging for themselves how far this representation is just\u2014Plotinus, reasoning about the nature of the soul from its energies of sensation, expresses himself in these words\u2014\"\u03bf\u1f50 \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c0\u03c5\u03c3\u03af\u03bc\u03b1\u03be\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03b4\u03b9' \u03bf\u1f30\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03cd\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f51\u03c4\u1ff7, \u1f22 \u1f45\u03c0\u03c9\u03c2 \u1f02\u03bd \u03b4\u03b9\u1f70 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03cd\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u1f34\u03c7\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u03ac\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b3\u03c5\u03bc\u03bd\u03bf\u1f76. \u1f37 \u03a0\u03bb\u03ae\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9 \u1f09\u03c1\u03b5\u03ce\u03bd \u1f11\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f14\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9 \u03bf\u1f54\u03c4\u03b5 \u03bf\u1f30\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd \u1f10\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6 \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c0\u03c5\u03c3\u03af\u03bc\u03b1\u03be\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f51\u03c4\u1ff7, \u1f22 \u1f45\u03c0\u03c9\u03c2 \u1f21 \u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03c5\u03cc\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03cd\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u1f34\u03c7\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u03ac\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b3\u03c5\u03bc\u03bd\u03bf\u1f76. \u1f37 \u03a0\u03bb\u03ae\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9 \u1f09\u03c1\u03b5\u03ce\u03bd \u1f11\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f14\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9 \u03bf\u1f54\u03c4\u03b5 \u03bf\u1f30\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd \u1f10\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6 \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c0\u03c5\u03c3\u03af\u03bc\u03b1\u03be\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f51\u03c4\u1ff7,\" \"That which perceives in us, must of necessity be one thing, and by one and the same indivisible perceive all; and that whether they be more things entering through several organs of sense, as the many qualities of one substance, or one various and multiform thing, entering through the same organ, as the countenance and picture of a man. For it is not one thing in us that perceives the noise, and another thing the eyes; but it is one and the selfsame thing that perceiveth all. And when one thing enters through the eyes, another through the ears, both these also must of necessity come at last to one indivisible; otherwise they could not be compared together, nor one of them be affirmed to be different from the other, the several ideas of them meeting nowhere in one place.\" Pursuing the same argument, and having observed, that if what perceiveth in us be extended, then one of these three things must of necessity be affirmed, that either every part of this extended soul perceives a part only of the object, or every part of it the whole object; or else, that all comes to some one point, which alone perceives both the several parts of the object and the whole; he observes of the first three suppositions\u2014\n\n\"And if it be divided, together with the sensible object, so that one part of the soul must perceive one part of the object, and another another; and nothing in it, the whole sensible; just as I should have the sense of one thing, and you of another.\" Of the second supposition he writes thus in this manner: \"[If there were such an existence than those which are separate and distinct, such that one soul does not perceive two things in one sensibleness and image of one object.] \"But if every part of the extended soul perceive the whole sensible object, since magnitude is infinitely divisible, there must be in every man infinite sensations and images of one object.\"\n\n\"And as for the third and last part of this disjunction, Plotinus by afflicting the infinite divisibility of body, here shows that the supposition of any one physical point is in itself an absurdity. But if it were not, he agrees with Aristotle.\nOf the substance of the sentient principle appear to be, they have been lately treated with the most sovereign contempt by a writer who professes to be a disciple of Dr Priestley's, but who seems not to have learned the modesty or the candour of his master. Dr Priestley labours to prove, that to account for the phenomena of perception and volition, &c., it is not necessary to suppose an immaterial principle in man. Mr Cooper with greater boldness affirms, and undertakes to demonstrate with all the parade of mathematical precision*, that such a principle is impossible. Though the authority of this philosopher in such inquiries as depend not immediately upon the retort and the furnace, is certainly not great, he yet utters his dogmas with such confidence, that it may not be improper to examine the chief arguments upon which they rest.\n\n\"Suppose (says he) the soul to have no common property with matter; then, nothing can act upon any other but by means of some common property. Of this we have not only all the proof that induction of known and acknowledged cases can furnish, but that additional proof also which arises from the impossibility of conceiving how the opposite proposition can be true. But by the supposition, the soul has no property in common with matter; and therefore the soul cannot act upon matter. But by the supposition of every system of immaterialism (except those of Malebranche, Berkeley, and Leibnitz), it is deemed an essential property of the soul, that it acts upon the body, or upon matter; therefore the soul can and cannot act upon matter at the same time, and in the same respect. But this is a contradiction in terms; and as two contradictions cannot both be true at the same time, the supposition of the existence of an immaterial soul cannot be true; that is, the soul does not exist.\"\n\nThis reasoning, the reader will observe, is carried on with all the pomp of mode and figure. The propositions hang upon each other like the several steps of an algebraic process: but as in such processes one error unwarily admitted produces a false result, so in demonstrative reasonings one unfound argument admitted into the premises is necessarily productive of error in the conclusion. When the author affirms, \"that nothing can act upon any other but by means of some common property,\" he affirms without the shadow of proof what is certainly not self-evident. He says, indeed, that of this we have all the proof that induction of known and acknowledged cases can furnish; but unless consciousness be calculated to deceive us, this is unquestionably a mistake. Matter, he repeatedly affirms, has no other properties than those of attraction and repulsion: but a man moves his arm by a mere energy of will; and therefore, according to this demonstrator, an energy of will must be either material attraction or material repulsion. If so, it is reasonable to conclude, that when a man draws his hand towards his head, the centre of his brain exerts its power of attraction; and that when he extends his arm at full length before him, the same centre exerts its power of repulsion. We beg pardon of our readers for detaining them one moment upon such absurdities as these: yet we cannot dismiss the argument without taking the liberty to ask our all-knowing author, How it comes to pass that the same centre sometimes attracts and sometimes repels the same substance at the same distance; nay, that it both attracts and repels substances of the same kind, at equal distances, and at the very same instant of time? This must be the case, when a man puts one hand to his head, and thrusts another from him; and therefore, if these operations be the effect of attraction and repulsion, it must be of attraction and repulsion to which induction of known and acknowledged cases furnishes nothing similar or analogous, i.e., of such attraction and repulsion as, according to Mr Cooper's mode of reasoning, does not exist. The truth is, that we are not more certain that we ourselves exist, than that an energy of will is neither attraction nor repulsion; and therefore, unless all matter be ended with will, it is undeniable, that whatever be the substance of the soul, one thing acts upon another by a property not common to them both. In what manner it thus acts, we pretend not to know: but our ignorance of the manner of any operation is no argument against the reality of the operation itself; when we have for it the evidence of consciousness and daily experience; and when the author shall have explained to general satisfaction how material centres attract and repel each other at a distance, we shall undertake to explain how one thing acts upon another with which it has no common properties.\n\nSuspicious, as it should seem, that this reasoning has not the complete force of mathematical demonstration, the author supports his opinion by other arguments.\n\n\"Whatever we know (says he), we know by means of its properties, nor do we in any case whatever certainly know anything but these; and we infer in all cases the existence of anything which we suppose to exist from the existence of its properties. In short, our idea of anything is made up of a combination of our ideas of its properties. Gold is heavy, ductile, tenacious, opaque, yellow, soluble in aqua regia, &c. Now, let any one suppose for an instant that gold is deprived of all these, and becomes neither heavy, ductile, tenacious, opaque, yellow, soluble, &c. what remains, will it be gold? Certainly not. If it have other properties, it is another substance. If it have no properties remaining, it is nothing. For nothing is that which hath no properties. Therefore, if any thing lose all its properties, it becomes nothing; that is, it loses its existence. Now, the existence of the soul is inferred, like the existence of every thing else, from its supposed properties, which are the phenomena of thinking, such as perception, recollection, judgement, and volition. But in all cases of perfect sleep, of the operation of a strong narcotic, of apoplexy, of swooning, of drowning where the vital powers are not extinguished, of the effects of a violent blow on the back.\n\nAristotle in asking \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u1ff7 \u1f45\u03c1\u1ff3 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\u2014thereby plainly indicating, that the sentient principle is totally separated from extension, and can neither be considered as extended like a superficies or solid, nor unextended as a physical point.\nChap. II.\n\nOf the Substance of the Human Mind.\n\nMetaphysics.\n\nFor the benefit of short-sighted inquirers, it is to be wished that the author had favoured the public with this proof which might have been so easily brought; for we can discern no connexion whatever between the suspension of the exercise of the powers of the mind, and the archetypal existence of abstract ideas, or the absurd proposition that it is possible for the same thing to be and not to be. We think, however, that we understand enough of this reasoning which he has given us to be able to pronounce with some confidence that it is nothing to the purpose. For, in the first place, we beg leave to observe, that between the properties of gold and the powers of thinking, &c., there is no similarity; and that what may be true when affirmed of the one, may be false when affirmed of the other. The powers of the mind are all more or less active; the enumerated properties of gold are all passive. We know by the most complete of all evidence, that the exercise of power may be suspended, and the power itself remain unimpaired; but to talk of the suspension of the energies of what was never energetic, if it be not to contradict the axiom impossible effidem esse et non esse, is certainly to employ words which have no meaning. Yet even this argument from the properties of gold might have led the author to suspect that something else may be meant by the suspension of the exercise of powers, than that those powers are made not to exist for the time. In a room perfectly dark gold is not yellow; but does it lose any of its essential properties, and become a different substance, merely by being carried from light to darkness? Is a man while in a dark room deprived of the faculty of sight, and one of the powers of his mind made not to exist for the time? The author will not affirm that either of these events takes place. He will tell us that gold exhibits not its yellow appearance, merely because the proper medium of light passes not from it to the eye of the percipient, and that it is only for want of the same medium that nothing is seen by us in perfect darkness. Here, then, by his own confession, is a power of the mind, and a property of an external object, both suspended in their energies, without being annihilated; and no proof has yet been brought that all the powers of the mind may not in the same manner be suspended in their energies without being made not to exist. As light is necessary to vision, but is not itself either the thing which sees or the thing which is seen; so may the brain be necessary to the phenomena of thinking, without being either that which thinks, or that which is thought upon: and as actual vision ceases when light is withdrawn, though the eye and the object both continue to exist; so may the energy of thinking cease when the brain is rendered unfit for its usual office, though the being which thinks, and the power of thought, continue to exist, and to exist unimpaired. That this is actually the case every man must be convinced who believes that in thinking he exerts the same powers today that he exerted yesterday; and therefore our author's second demonstration of the nonexistence of mind is, like his first, founded upon assertions which cannot be granted.\n\nAnother of these pretended demonstrations is as follows: \"If the soul exist at all, it must exist somewhere; for it is impossible to frame to one's self the same idea of anything existing, which exists nowhere. But if the soul exist somewhere, by the terms it occupies space, and therefore is extended; but whatever has extension, has figure in consequence thereof. The soul then, if it exist, hath the properties of extension and figure in common with matter. Moreover, by the supposition of every immaterial hypothesis (except those of Malebranche, Berkeley, and Leibnitz), it acts upon body, i.e., upon matter; that is, it attracts and repels, and is attracted and repelled, for there is no conceivable affection of matter but what is founded on its properties of attraction and repulsion; and if it be attracted and repelled, its reaction must be attraction and repulsion. The soul then has the properties of extension, figure, attraction and repulsion, or solidity. But these comprise every property which matter, as such, has ever been supposed to possess. Therefore the soul is matter, or material. But by the supposition it is immaterial; therefore it does not exist. For nothing can exist whose existence implies a contradiction.\"\n\nMr Cooper, we see, still proceeds in the direct road of mathematical demonstration; but in the present instance we beg leave to stop him in the very beginning of his course, and to ask where the universe exists? When he shall have given such an answer to this question as men of common sense may be able to comprehend, we may perhaps attempt to tell him where an unextended soul exists. If this demonstration be not a collection of words without meaning, the existence of space as a real thing is taken for granted. Space, therefore, has extension, and of course figure; but we believe Mr Cooper will find some difficulty in ascertaining the figure of infinite space. The mind certainly acts upon body. For this we have the evidence of consciousness and experience; but we have no evidence whatever that it must therefore attract and repel, and be attracted and repelled. It has been already observed, that the mind, whatever be its substance, acts upon the body by energies of will. What these are, every man knows with the utmost certainty and precision; whilst we may venture to assert, that no man knows precisely what corporeal attraction and repulsion are, supposing the existence of such powers to be possible. When we speak of attraction and repulsion, we have some obscure notion of bodies acting upon each other at a distance; and this is all that we know of the matter. But when we think of an energy of the human will, the idea of distance neither enters nor can enter into our notion of such an energy. These are facts which we pretend not to prove by a mathematical or a chemical process. Every man must be convinced.\nOf the Sub-convinced of their truth by evidence more complete than any proof, viz. immediate consciousness of his own thoughts and volitions. This being the case, we may turn Mr Cooper's artillery against himself; and, because mind acts upon body by powers different from attraction and repulsion, argue that body neither attracts nor repels; and were it true, as it is certainly false, that nothing could act upon another but by means of some property common to both, we might infer that every atom of matter is endowed with the powers of volition and intelligence, and by consequence that every man is not one but ten thousand conscious beings, a conclusion which our philosopher seems not inclined to admit.\n\nHaving finished his demonstrations, the author states other objections to the doctrine of immaterialism, which, as they are not his own nor new, have greater weight. \"It appears no more than reasonable (says he), that if the doctrine of materialism be rejected as inadequate to explain the phenomena, these latter should at least be explained in some manner or other better upon the substituted than the rejected hypothesis; so that it is reasonable to require of an immaterialist that his supposition of a distinct soul should explain the rationale of the phenomena of thinking. But, strange to say, so far from attempting to explain these phenomena on the immaterial hypothesis, it is acknowledged on all hands that even on this hypothesis the phenomena are inexplicable.\" This objection it would certainly be no difficult talk to obviate; but from that trouble, small as it is, we are happily exempted by the objector. \"I would have it understood (says he), that no materialist ever undertook to say how perception results from our organization. What a materialist undertakes to assert is, that perception, whatever it be, or however it results from, does actually result from our organization.\" According to Mr Cooper, then, the rationale of thinking is equally inexplicable by materialists and immaterialists; and the truth is, that we know the rationale of hardly any one operation in nature. We see that the stroke of a racket produces motion in a billiard ball; but how it does so, we believe no man can say. Of the fact, however, we are certain; and know that the motion is produced by some power, about the effects of which we can reason with precision. In like manner we know with the utmost certainty, that we ourselves have the powers of perception and volition; and that these powers cannot be conceived as either an ell or an inch long. How they result from the mutual agency of an immaterial and material substance upon each other, we are indeed profoundly ignorant; but that such is the fact, and that they are not the result of mere organization, we must necessarily believe, so long as it is true that the power of the entire system is nothing more than the sum or aggregate of the powers of all its parts. The immaterial hypothesis contains in it something inexplicable by man: The material hypothesis likewise contains, by the confession of its advocates, something that it equally inexplicable; and is over and above burdened with this contradiction, that the whole is something different from all its parts. It is therefore no singular phenomenon in literary history, that one hypothesis should be rejected as inadequate to account for appearances, and that the hypothesis substituted should, even by the acknowledgment of its abettors, be such as not only not to explain the cause of the appearances, but from the nature of the human mind, to preclude all hopes of such an explanation.\"\n\nThis is exactly the case with respect to a vacuum in astronomy. That hypothesis does not in the least tend to explain the rationale of the motions of the planets; but yet it must be admitted in preference to a plenum, because upon this last hypothesis motion is impossible.\n\n\"Supposing the existence of the soul, it is an unfortunate circumstance (says Mr Cooper), that we cannot properly affect positively any thing of it at all.\" Were this the case, it would indeed be a very foul as unfortunate circumstance; but can we not affect positively as many things of the soul as we can of the body? Can we not say with as much propriety and certainty, that the soul has the powers of perception and volition, &c., as that the body is solid and extended, or as that matter has the powers of attraction and repulsion? We know perfectly what perception and volition are, though we cannot have ideas or mental images of them; and if our author knows what attraction and repulsion are, we believe he will not pretend to have of them ideas entirely abstracted from their objects. \"But granting the soul's existence, it may be asked (says he), Of what use is an hypothesis of which no more can be affected than its existence?\" We have just observed, that much more can be affected of the soul than its existence, viz. that it is something of which perception and will are properties; and he himself affirms nothing of matter but that it is something of which attraction and repulsion are properties.\n\n\"This soul, of which these gentlemen (the immaterialists) are conscious, is immaterial essentially. Now, I deny (says our author), that we can have any idea at all of a substance purely immaterial.\" He elsewhere says, that nothing can exist which is not extended, or that extension is inseparable from our notions of existence. Taking the word idea in its proper sense, to denote that appearance which external objects make in the imagination, it is certainly true that we can have no idea of an immaterial substance; but neither have we, in that sense, any idea of matter abstracted from its qualities. Has Mr Cooper any idea of that which attracts and repels, or of attraction and repulsion, abstracted from their objects? He may, perhaps, have, though we have not, very adequate ideas of bodies acting upon each other at a distance; but as he takes the liberty to substitute assertions for arguments, we beg leave in our turn to affirm, that those ideas neither are, nor can be, more clear and adequate than our notion of perception, consciousness, and will, united in one being.\n\nThat extension is no otherwise inseparable from our notions of existence than by the power of an early and not infrequent association, is evident from this circumstance, all nations that had never possessed the senses of sight and of exit-touch, we never could have acquired any idea at all of extension. No man, who has thought on the subject, will venture to affirm, that it is absolutely impossible for an intelligent being to exist with no other senses than those of smell, taste, and hearing. Now it is obvious that such a being must acquire some notion of existence.\nChap. II.\n\nOf the subsistence from his own consciousness: but into that notion of extension could not possibly enter; for neither sounds, tastes, smells, nor consciousness, are extended; and it is a fundamental article of the materialists' creed, that all our ideas are relics of sensation. Since then existence may be conceived without extension, it may be inferred that they are not inseparable from each other; and since cognition cannot be conceived with extension, we may reasonably conclude, that the being which thinks is not extended.\n\nMr Cooper indeed, with his master, talks of extended ideas and extended thoughts: but we must assert, in the words of Cudworth, that \"we cannot conceive a thought to be of such a certain length, breadth, and thickness, measurable by inches, feet, and yards; that we cannot conceive the half, or third, or twentieth part of a thought; and that we cannot conceive every thought to be of some determinate figure, such as round or angular, spherical, cubical, cylindrical, or the like. Wherefore if extension were inseparable from existence, thoughts must either be mere nonentities, or extended into length, breadth, and thickness; and consequently all truths in us (being nothing but complex thoughts) must be long, broad, and thick, and of some determinate figure. The same must likewise be affirmed of volitions, appetites, and passions, and of all other things belonging to cognitive beings; such as knowledge and ignorance, wisdom and folly, virtue and vice, &c. that these are either all of them absolute nonentities, or else extended into three dimensions, and measurable not only by inches and feet, but also by solid measures, such as pints and quarts. But if this be absurd, and if these things belonging to soul and mind (though doubted as great realities at least as the things which belong to body) be unextended, then must the substances of souls or minds be themselves unextended, according to that of Plotinus, \u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u1f55\u03bb\u1fc3 \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd, and therefore the human soul cannot be material.\"\n\nMr Cooper employs many other arguments to prove the materiality of the sentient principle in man; but the force of them extends no farther than to make it in the highest degree probable, that the mind cannot exert its faculties but in union with some organized corporeal system. This is an opinion which we feel not ourselves inclined to controvert; and therefore we shall not make any particular remarks upon that part of our author's reasonings. That an immaterial and indiscernible being, such as the soul, is not liable to be disjoined with the body, is a fact which cannot be controverted: for what has no parts can perish only by annihilation; and of annihilation the annals of the world afford no instance. That an immaterial being, endowed with the powers of perception and volition, &c. may be capable of exerting these powers in a state of separation from all body, and that at least one immaterial Being does actually so exert them, or other powers analogous to them, are truths which no man whose arrogance does not surpass his judgement will venture to deny; but the question at present between the most rigid immaterialists and their opponents, is, whether there be ground to think that the human soul is such a being?\n\nNow, when Mr Baxter and his followers confidently affirm, that human perception must necessarily subsist after the dissolution of the present mortal and perishable\n\nVol. XIII. Part II.\nOf the Sub-body. Agreeably to this the definition which he gives of a man is, \u1f21 \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u1f70 \u03c3\u03c9\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b1\u1f30\u03ce\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u1f51\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f10\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f30\u03b4\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f14\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd, a rational soul, together with a kindred immortal body; and he affirms, that our present animated terrestrial body, or mortal man, is nothing but \u1f21 \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5, the image of the true man, or an accretion from which it may be separated. Neither does he affirm this only of human souls, but also of all other rational beings whatsoever below the Supreme Deity, that they always naturally actuate some body. Wherefore a demon or angel (which by Hierocles are used as synonymous words), is also defined by him after the same manner, \u1f21 \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u1f70 \u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd, a rational soul, together with a lucid body. And accordingly Proclus upon Plato's Timaeus affirmeth, \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f14\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bd\u03b5\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u1f76 \u1f22 \u03b6\u1ff6\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2, \u1f22 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u1fe6, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u1fe6: That every demon, superior to human souls, hath both an intellectual soul and an ethereal vehicle, the entwines thereof being made up or compounded of these two things. So that there is hardly any other difference between demons or angels, and men, according to these philosophers, but only this, that the former are lapable into aerial bodies only, and no further; but the latter into terrestrial also. Now, Hierocles positively affirms this to have been the true cabala, and genuine doctrine of the ancient Pythagoreans, entertained afterwards by Plato: \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03a0\u03c5\u03b8\u03b1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c3\u03af\u03bf\u03c5, \u1f41 \u1f10\u03ba \u03a0\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f41\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03bb\u03ae\u03c1\u03c9\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd \u1f10\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd, \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03ad\u03c3\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f10\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u1f10\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u1f10\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u1f10\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4\u1f78 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u1f78\u03bd \u1f10\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd. And this was the doctrine of the Pythagoreans, which Plato afterwards declared; he referring every both human and divine soul (i.e. in our modern language, every created rational being) to a winged chariot, and a driver or charioteer both together: meaning by the chariot, an animated body; and by the charioteer, the incorporeal soul actuating it.\n\nThat this Pythagorean opinion of the Deity's being the only mind which thinks and acts without material organs was very generally received by the ancient Christians, might be proved by a thousand quotations: We shall content ourselves with producing two from the learned Origen. \"Solius Dei (faith this philosophic father of the church), id est, Patris, Filii, et Spiritus Sancti, naturae id proprium est, ut sine materiali substantia, et abscide illa corporea adjectio- nis societate, intelligatur subsistere.\" \"Materialem substantiam opinionem quidem et intellectu solium separari, a naturis rationalibus, et pro ipsis, vel post ipsas affectam videri; sed nunquam sine ipsa eas vel vivificare, vel vivere: Solius namque Trinitatis incorporea vita existere putabitur.\" Should Mr. Cooper and his friends ask, What is the use of a soul which cannot act without the instrumentality of matter? or why we should suppose the existence of such a substance? we beg leave, in our turn, to ask these gentlemen, What is the use of a brain which cannot see without eyes? and why they should suppose all our sensations to terminate in such an internal system, since the vulgar certainly suppose their sensations to subsist in their respective organs? How this ancient notion, which makes body so essential a part of man, is consistent with the immortality of the human soul, we shall inquire in a subsequent chapter; in which we shall endeavour to ascertain what kind of immortality we have reason to expect, and upon what evidence our expectations must rest. Previous to this inquiry, however, it is necessary to enter upon another, which is of the first importance, and which every materialist has endeavoured to perplex; we mean that which concerns personal identity: for if, as has been often said, no man is the same person two days successively, it is of no importance to us whether the soul be mortal or immortal.\n\nChap. III. Of Personal Identity.\n\nWhether we are to live in a future state, as it is the most important question which can possibly be identity, asked, so it is the most intelligible one which can be expressed in language. Yet strange perplexities have been raised about the meaning of that identity or sameness of person, which is implied in the notion of our living now and hereafter, or indeed in any two successive moments; and the solution of these difficulties hath been stranger than the difficulties themselves. To repeat all that has been said on the subject would swell this chapter to a disproportionate bulk. We shall therefore content ourselves with laying before our readers the sentiments of Bishop Butler, and the fancies and demonstrations of the philosopher of Manchester. We are induced to adopt this course, because we think the illustrious bishop of Durham has exhausted the subject, by stating fairly the opinions which he controverts, and by establishing his own upon a foundation which cannot be shaken, and which are certainly not injured, by the objections of Mr. Cooper.\n\n\"When it is asked (says this philosophical prelate) though it in what personal identity consists? the answer should be cannot be the same as if it were asked in what consists similitude or equality?\u2014that all attempts to define would but afford and perplex it. Yet there is no difficulty at all in ascertaining the idea or notion: For as, upon two triangles by comparing or viewed together, there arises to memory, the mind the notion of similitude; or, upon twice two * Differents and four, the notion of equality: so likewise, upon two, comparing the consciousness of one's self or one's own subsistence in any two moments, there arises immediately to the mind the notion of personal identity. And as the two former comparisons not only give us the notions of similitude and equality, but also show us that two triangles are similar, and that twice two and four are equal; so the latter comparison not only gives us the notion of personal identity, but also shows us the identity of ourselves in these two moments\u2014the present, supposed, and that immediately past, or the present and that a month, a year, or twenty years past. In other words, by reflecting upon that which is myself now, and that which was myself twenty years ago, I discern they are not two, but one and the same self.\n\n\"But though consciousness of what is present and there, remembrance of what is past do thus ascertain our personal identity to ourselves; yet, to say that remembrance makes personal identity, or is necessary to our personal identity being the same persons, is to say that a person has not identity existed a single moment, nor done one action, but what he can remember; indeed none but what he reflects upon. And one should really think it self-evident, that consciousness of personal identity presupposes and therefore\nThe inquiry, what makes vegetables the same in the common acceptation of the word, does not appear to have any relation to this of personal identity; because the word same, when applied to them and to person, is not only applied to different subjects, but is also used in different senses. When a man speaks to the same tree, as having stood fifty years in the same place, he means only the same as to all the purposes of property and uses of common life, and not that the tree has been all that time the same in the strict philosophical sense of the word: For he does not know whether any one particle of the present tree be the same with any one particle of the tree which stood in the same place fifty years ago. And if they have not one common particle of matter they cannot be the same tree in the proper and philosophical sense of the word same; it being evidently a contradiction in terms to say they are, when no part of their substance and no one of their properties is the same; no part of their substance, by the supposition; no one of their properties, because it is allowed that the same property cannot be transferred from one substance to another: And therefore, when we say that the identity or sameness of a plant consists in a continuation of the same life, communicated under the same organization to a number of particles of matter, whether the same or not; the word same, when applied to life and to organization, cannot possibly be understood to signify what it signifies in this very sentence, when applied to matter. In a loose and popular sense, then, the life, and the organization, and the plant, are justly said to be the same, notwithstanding the perpetual change of the parts. But, in a strict and philosophical manner of speech, no man, no being, no mode of being, no anything, can be the same with that with which it has indeed nothing the same. Now sameness is used in this latter sense when applied to persons. The identity of these, therefore, cannot subsist with diversity of substance.\n\nThe thing here considered, and demonstratively, as I think, determined, is proposed by Mr Locke in these words: Whether it (i.e., the same self or person) be the same identical substance? And he has suggested what is a much better answer to the question than that which he gives it in form: For he defines person a thinking intelligent being, &c., and personal identity, the sameness of a rational being; and then the question is, Whether the same rational being is the same substance? which needs no answer; because being and substance are in this place synonymous terms. The ground of the doubt, whether the same person be the same substance, is said to be this, that the consciousness of our own existence, in youth and in old age, or in any two joint successive moments, is not the same individual action, i.e., not the same consciousness, but different successive consciousnesses. Now it is strange that this should have occasioned such perplexities: for it is surely conceivable that a person may have a capacity of knowing some object or other to be the same now which it was when he contemplated it formerly; yet in this case, where, by the supposition, the object is perceived to be the same, the perception of it in any two moments cannot be one and the same perception. And thus, though the successive consciousnesses which we have of our own existence are not the same, yet are they conscious-nesses of one and the same thing or object; of the same person, self, or living agent. The person of whose existence the consciousness is felt now, and was felt an hour or a year ago, is discerned to be, not two persons, but one and the same person; and therefore is one and the same.\n\nMr Locke's observations upon this subject appear falshasty; and he seems to profess himself dissatisfied with notions of suppositions which he has made relating to it. But personal identity of those hasty observations have been carried to a strange length by others; whose notion, when traced and examined to the bottom, amounts, I think, to this: 'That personality is not a permanent but a transient thing: That it lives and dies, begins and ends, continually: That no one can any more remain one and the same person two moments together, than two successive moments can be one and the same moment: That our substance is indeed continually changing: but whether this be so or not, is, it seems, nothing to the purpose; since it is not substance, but consciousness alone, which constitutes personality; which consciousness, being successive, cannot be the same in any two moments, nor consequently the personality constituted by it *.' Hence it must follow, * Answer that it is a fallacy upon ourselves to charge our present selves with any thing we did, or to imagine our present selves interested in any thing which befell us yesterday; or that our present self will be interested in what will befal us tomorrow; since our present self is not in reality the same with the self of yesterday, but another self or person coming into its room, and mistaken for it; to which another self will succeed to-morrow. This, I say, must follow: for if the self or person of to-day and that of to-morrow are not the same, but only like persons; the person of to-day is really no more interested in what will befal the person of to-morrow, than in what will befal any other person. It may be thought, perhaps, that this is not a just representation of the opinion we are speaking of; because those who maintain it allow that a person is the same as far back as his remembrance reaches: And indeed they do use the words identity and same person; nor will language permit these words to be laid aside. But they cannot, confidently with themselves, mean that the person is really the same: For it is self-evident, that the personality cannot be really the same, if, as they expressly assert, that in which it consists is not the same. And as, confidently with themselves, they cannot, so I think it appears they do not, mean that the person is really the same, but only that he is so in a fictitious sense, in such a sense only as they assert: for this they do assert, that any number of persons whatever may be the same person. The bare unfolding of this notion, and laying it thus naked and open, seems the best confutation of it. However, since great fires are said to be put upon it, I add the following things:\n\nFifthly, This notion is absolutely contradictory to over-thrown that certain conviction, which necessarily and every moment riles within us, when we turn our thoughts upon ourselves, when we reflect upon what is past, and look forward to what is to come. All imagination, of a daily change of that living agent which each man calls him-\nOf personal self for another, or of any such change throughout our identity, whole present life, is entirely borne down by our natural sense of things. Nor is it possible for a person in his wits to alter his conduct with regard to his health or affairs, from a suspicion that though he should live tomorrow he should not however be the same person he is today.\n\n\"Secondly, It is not an idea or abstract notion, or quality, but a being only, which is capable of life and action, of happiness and misery. Now all beings confessedly continue the same during the whole time of their existence. Consider then a living being now existing, and which has existed for any time alive; this living being must have done, and suffered, and enjoyed, what it has done, and suffered, and enjoyed, formerly (this living being, I say, and not another), as really as it does, and suffers, and enjoys, what it does, and suffers, and enjoys, this instant. All these successive actions, sufferings, and enjoyments, are actions, enjoyments, and sufferings, of the same living being; and they are so prior to all considerations of its remembering or forgetting, since remembering or forgetting can make no alteration in the truth of past matter of fact. And suppose this being endowed with limited powers of knowledge and memory, there is no more difficulty in conceiving it to have a power of knowing itself to be the same being which it was some time ago, of remembering some of its actions, sufferings, and enjoyments, and forgetting others, than in conceiving it to know, or remember, or forget, anything else.\n\n\"Thirdly, Every person is conscious that he is now the same person or self he was as far back as his remembrance reaches: since when any one reflects upon a past action of his own, he is just as certain of the person who did that action, namely himself (the person who now reflects upon it), as he is certain that the action was at all done. Nay, very often a person's assurance of an action having been done, of which he is absolutely assured, arises wholly from the consciousness that he himself did it: and this he, person, or self, must either be a substance or the property of some substance. If he, if person, be a substance; then consciousness that he is the same person, is consciousness that he is the same substance. If the person, or he, be the property of a substance, still consciousness that he is the same property is as certain a proof that his substance remains the same, as consciousness that he remains the same substance would be; since the same property cannot be transferred from one substance to another.\n\n\"But though we are thus certain than we are the same agents, living beings, or substances, now, which we were as far back as our remembrance reaches; yet it is asked, Whether we may not possibly be deceived in it? And this question may be asked at the end of any demonstration whatever; because it is a question concerning the truth of perception by memory: and he who can doubt whether perception by memory can in this case be depended upon, may doubt also whether perception by deduction and reasoning, which also include memory, or indeed whether intuitive perception itself, can be depended upon. Here then we can go no farther: for it is ridiculous to attempt to prove the truth of our faculties, which can no otherwise be proved than by the use or means of those suspected faculties themselves.\"\n\nThis reasoning, which we believe will to most men appear unanswerable, Mr Cooper hopes to overturn by the following observations: \"If all imagination of a to the fore-daily change in us be borne down by our natural sense going reasoning, then (says he) does our natural sense of things positively contradict known fact; for a daily, &c., a momentaneous, change in us, i.e. in our bodies, does actually take place.\" True, a daily change in our bodies does take place, and so likewise does a daily change in our clothes; but surely no man was ever led by his natural sense of things to suppose, that his limbs or external organs were the seats of sensation and will, any more than that his coat or his shoes were any real parts of his trunk or of his feet. But it is only that which thinks and wills than any man considers in this case, as himself or his person; and if our natural sense of things, or consciousness, tell us, that what thinks and wills has continued the same from a distance of time as far back as we can remember, it is certain, that, whether it be material or immaterial, it has continued from that period, otherwise we can be certain of nothing. \"But (says our philosopher) other known and ascertained facts are frequently borne down by our natural sense of things: for how many thousand years before the days of Copernicus was the motion of the earth round the sun entirely borne down by our natural sense of things, which made us give full credit to the motion of the sun round the earth? Do not the generality of mankind believe, upon the evidence of their natural sense of things, that every part of their body remains exactly the same today as it was yesterday?\"\n\nTo the former of these questions we answer positively, that before the days of Copernicus the motion of the earth round the sun was not borne down by our natural sense of things, but by ill-founded hypotheses and inconclusive reasonings. By the natural sense of things, nothing can be meant, in this place, but the evidence of consciousness or of external sensation; but the actual motion either of the sun or of the earth is not perceived either by consciousness or by sensation. Of consciousness nothing is the object but the internal energies and feelings of our own minds; and with regard to the motion of the sun or of the earth, nothing is perceived by the sense of sight but that, after considerable intervals of time, these two great bodies have repeatedly changed their places in the heavens with respect to each other. This is all that on this subject our natural sense of things leads us to believe; and is not this infallibly true? Afterwards indeed, by taking for granted the truth of propositions, for which neither sense nor consciousness affords the shadow of evidence; the vulgar now, and all mankind formerly, reasoned themselves into the opinion, that the earth stands still, and that the sun moves round it. In vulgar philosophy it is taken for granted, that in the universe there is not a relative but an absolute upwards and an absolute downwards; that our heads are absolutely upward, and our feet downward; and that were the earth to revolve round its axis, these positions would be reversed, that our heads would be placed beneath our feet, and that we ourselves would fall from the earth into\nUpon these false hypotheses the vulgar reason correctly. They know that bodies cannot change their place without motion; they know that in the time of their remembrance the sun and the earth have been perpetually varying their places with respect to each other; they know that they themselves have never fallen, nor had a tendency to fall, into empty space; and hence they infer that it is the sun and not the earth that moves (k). But will any man say that the absurd suppositions from which this conclusion is logically deduced, have the evidence either of sensation or of consciousness, as the permanency of that living agent which each man calls himself?\n\nTo our author's second question we likewise reply with confidence, that the generality of mankind do not believe, upon their natural sense of things, that every part of their body remains exactly the same to-day as it was yesterday. It would be strange indeed if they did, after having repeatedly experienced the waste of increased perspiration or sweating; after having witnessed men emaciated by sickness, and again restored to plumpness in health; and after having perhaps lost whole limbs, which certainly their natural sense of things teaches them to consider as parts of their body. In all these cases, the generality of mankind are as sensible of changes having taken place in their bodies as he who has attended ever so closely to physiological inquiries, though not one of them has the least imagination of a change having taken place in the living agent which each man calls himself.\n\nBishop Butler observes, that if the living agent be perpetually changing, it is a fallacy upon ourselves to charge our present selves with any thing we did, to imagine our present selves interested in any thing which befell us yesterday, or that our present self will be interested in what will befall us tomorrow. To this judicious observation our daring philosopher replies, \"that as the man of to-morrow, though not in all points the same with, yet depends for his existence upon, the man of to-day, there is sufficient reason to care about him.\" Could he have said, that as the man of to-day depends for his existence on the man of to-morrow, there is sufficient reason for the present man to care about the future man; or that as the man of to-morrow depends for his existence on the man of to-day, there is today sufficient reason for the future man to care about the present man; we should in either case, if the anachronism had been kept out of sight, have seen the force of his argument. Every man has sufficient reason to care about the ox upon which he is to be fed; but we cannot so clearly perceive what reason the ox has to care about the man.\n\nNot satisfied, it would seem, with this reply, our author proceeds to affirm, \"that the man of to-morrow, possessing a reminiscence of the actions of the man of to-day, and knowing that these actions will be referred to him both by himself and others (which is certainly knowing that both himself and others are most iniquitous wretches), they cannot be indifferent to the man of to-day, who looks forward to the properties of the man of to-morrow;\" i.e. the reminiscence and knowledge of a future man constitute all the relation that subsists between a present man and his actions; a discovery worthy of an original genius. But as on the subject of personal identity we pretend to no originality, we shall leave this proposition to the meditation of our readers, and take the liberty to ask our author a question or two respecting this same reminiscence, which he is graciously pleased to acknowledge for a property.\n\nHe defines identity, \"the continued existence of any being unaltered in substance or in properties;\" and he repeatedly acknowledges that no identical quality or property can be transferred from one subject to another. Let us now suppose, that a man has a reminiscence of an individual action performed a month ago, and that this reminiscence is accompanied with a consciousness that the action was performed by himself. This supposition, whether true or false, may certainly be made; for it implies nothing more than what every man firmly believes of himself in every act of remembrance. Let us again suppose, that at the distance of ten or twenty years, the man known by the same name has a reminiscence of the same action, with a consciousness that he himself performed it. Is this reminiscence the same with the former? or is it a different reminiscence? If it be the same, either the person remembering at the distance of ten or twenty years is the same with him who remembered at the distance of a month, or there is an identical quality transferred from one substance to another, which is admitted to be impossible. If reminiscence be itself a real and immediate quality of any substance, and not the mere energy of a power, and if the one reminiscence be different from the other, the subjects in which these two different qualities inhere must likewise be different. Yet the man who has the reminiscence at the distance of a month, has the evidence of consciousness that the action was performed by him; and the man who has the reminiscence at the distance of ten or twenty years, has likewise the evidence of consciousness that the same action was performed by him and not by another. By the confession of Hume and of all philosophers, consciousness never deceives; but here is the evidence of one consciousness in direct opposition to another; and therefore, as two contradictory propositions cannot both be true, either the one reminiscence is the same with the other, or reminiscence is no real quality. That one act of reminiscence should be numerically the same with another, which followed it at the distance of twenty years, is plainly impossible; whence it should seem, that reminiscence itself is no real and immediate quality of any substance. But if this be so, what is reminiscence? We answer, it is plainly neither more nor less than the energy of a power, which\n\n(k) This inference too has been so often drawn, that it comes in time to coalesce in the mind with the sensations, from which the motion either of the sun or of the earth is deduced with infallible certainty; and hence it is considered as part of that truth which sensation immediately discovers. See our Chapter of Association.\nOf personal which though dormant between its energies, remains unchanged from the one to the other, and which being itself the real and immediate quality of a subject, that subject must likewise remain unchanged. That powers may remain dormant, and yet unchanged, every man must be convinced; who having struck anything with his hand, knows that he has power to repeat the stroke, and yet does not actually repeat it. Two blows with the hand immediately following each other are numerically different, so that the one cannot with truth be said to be the other; but we have the evidence of external sense, that they are both struck by the same member. In like manner, two energies of reminiscence directed to the same object, and succeeding each other at any interval of time, cannot possibly be one and the same energy; but as the latter energy may include in it the former as well as the object remembered by both, we have the evidence of consciousness that both are energies of the same power; and we have seen, that to suppose them any thing else, may be demonstrated to involve the grossest absurdities and contradictions.\n\nMr Cooper has other arguments to obviate the force of Bishop Butler's demonstration of personal identity; such as, that a \"high degree of similarity between the two succeeding men is sufficient to make the one care about the other;\" and, that \"a good man, knowing that a future being will be punished or rewarded as the actions of the present man deserve, will have a sufficient motive to do right and to abstain from wrong.\" But if there be any one of our readers who can suffer himself to be persuaded by such assertions as these, that the living agent which he calls himself is perpetually changing, and at the same time that such change is consistent with the expectation of future rewards and punishments, he would not be reclaimed from his error by any reasoning of ours. We shall therefore trust such trifling with every man's judgement, and proceed to examine our author's demonstration, that personal identity has no existence. But here it is no part of our purpose to accompany him through his long chemical ramble, or to controvert his arguments for the nonidentity of vegetable and animal bodies. The only thing to which, after Bishop Butler, we have ascribed identity, is that which in man is sentient and conscious; and the nonidentity of this thing, whatever it be, Mr Cooper undertakes to demonstrate from the known properties of sensations and ideas.\n\nThis demonstration sets out with a very ominous circumstance. The author, after conducting impressions ab extra, from the extremities of the nerves to the brain, affirms, that sensations and ideas are nothing but \"motions in the brain perceived;\" i.e. when a man thinks he is looking at a mountain, not only at rest, but to appearance immovable, he is grossly deceived: for he perceives nothing all the while but motion in his brain! Were not the desire of advancing novelties and paradoxes invincible in some minds, we should be astonished at finding such an assertion as this fall from the pen of any man who had paid the slightest attention to the different energies of his own intellect. Motions in the brain, as we have repeatedly observed, are the immediate causes of our sensations; but is it conceivable, is it possible, that any thing of personal should be the cause of itself? The motion of a sword through the heart of a man, is the immediate cause of that man's death; but is the sword or its motion death itself, or can they be conceived as being the sensations of the man in the agonies of dying? But sensations and ideas, whatever they be, exist in succession; and therefore, argues our demonstrator, no two sensations or ideas can be one and the same sensation or idea. The conclusion is logically inferred; but what purpose can it possibly serve? What purpose! why it seems \"sensations and ideas are the only existences whose existence we certainly know (a charming phrase, the existence of existence), and as original as the theory in which it makes its appearance); and, therefore, from the nature of sensations and ideas there is no such thing as permanent identity.\" Indeed! what then, we may be permitted to ask, is the import of the word we in this sentence? Does it denote a series of sensations and ideas, and does each sensation and each idea certainly know not only itself, but all its ancestors and all its descendants? Unless this be admitted, we are afraid that some other existence besides sensations and ideas must be allowed to be certainly known, and even to have something of a permanent identity. Nay, we think it has been already demonstrated (see Chapter of Time), that were there not something permanent, there could be no time, and of course no notion of a first and last, or indeed of succession, whether of sensations or ideas. And therefore, if we have such a notion, which the author here takes for granted, and upon which indeed his demonstration rests, it follows undeniably that there is something permanent, and that we know there is something permanent, which observes the succession of sensations and ideas.\n\n\"All this, indeed, Mr Cooper in effect grants; for shown to be not much startled at the appearance of contradictions in his theory. \"I find (says he), by perpetually loud repeated impositions which I perceive, that my hands, body, limbs, &c. are connected, are parts of one whole. I find, by perpetually repeated perceptions also, that the sensations excited by them are constantly similar, and constantly different from the sensations excited by others.\" He has then repeated perceptions: but how can this be possible, if he be not different from the perceptions, and if he do not remain unchanged while the perceptions succeed each other at greater or less intervals of time? A striking object passing with rapidity before the eyes of a number of men placed beside each other in a line of battle, would undoubtedly excite a succession of sensations; but surely that succession would not take place in the mind of any individual in the line, nor could any single man in this case lay with truth that he had repeated perceptions of the object. In like manner, were that which is sentient perpetually changing, no man could possibly say or suppose that he had repeated perceptions of any thing; for upon this supposition, the man of to-day would have no more connexion with the man who bore his name yesterday, or twenty years ago, than the man in the line had with the first.\n\nUpon the whole, we cannot help thinking that Bishop Butler's demonstration of personal identity remains unshaken by the batteries of Mr Cooper.\u2014It rests, indeed,\nOf personal deed, upon the solid basis of consciousness and memory; and if implicit credit be not given to the evidence of these faculties, we cannot proceed a single step in any inquiry whatever, nor be certain of the truth even of a mathematical demonstration.\n\nBut as we have ourselves supposed, that to sensation, reminiscence, and every actual energy of the mind of man, the instrumentality of some material system is necessary, it may perhaps be thought incumbent on us to show how the perpetual flux of the particles of matter which compose the brain, as well as all the other parts of the body, can consist with the identity of the person who perceives, remembers, and is conscious. If this cannot be done, our hypothesis, ancient and plausible as it is, must be given up; for of personal identity it is impossible to doubt. In this case, however, we perceive no difficulty; for if there be united to the brain an immaterial being, which is the subject of sensation, consciousness, and will, &c., it is obvious, that all the intellectual powers which properly constitute the person, must be inherent in that being. The material system, therefore, can be necessary only as an instrument to excite the energies of those powers; and since the powers themselves remain unchanged, why should we suppose that their energies may not be continually exerted by successive instruments of the same kind, as well as by one permanent instrument? The powers of perception and volition are not in the material system, any more than the sensation of seeing is in the rays of light, or the energy of the blacksmith in the hammer with which he beats the anvil. Let us suppose a man to keep his eye for an hour steadily fixed upon one object. It will not surely be denied, that if this could be done, he would have one uninterrupted and unvaried perception of an hour's duration, as measured by the clock. Yet it is certain that the rays of light which alone could occasion that perception would be perpetually changing. In like manner, a blacksmith, whilst he continues to beat his anvil, continues to exert the same power whether he uses one hammer all the time, or a different hammer at each stroke. The reason is obvious; the eye, with all its connexions of brain and mind in the one case, and the person of the smith in the other, remain unchanged; and in them alone reside the faculty of sensation and the power of beating, though neither the faculty nor the power can be exerted without material instruments. But were it possible that millions of men could in the space of an hour take their turns in rotation with each new ray of light, it is self-evident, that in this case, there would be nothing permanent in sensation; and, therefore, there could not be one uninterrupted and unvaried perception, but millions of perceptions, during the hour, totally distinct from and unconnected with each other. Let us now suppose a man to fix his eye upon an object for the space of a minute, and at the distance of a day or a month to fix it upon the same object a second time. He would not indeed, in this case, have one uninterrupted and unvaried perception, but he would be conscious of the energy of the very same faculty the second time as at the first. Whereas, were one man to view an object to-day, and another to view the same object tomorrow, it is obvious, that he who should be laid in the succession could know nothing of the energy of that faculty by which the object was perceived the first day, because there would be nothing common to the two perceptions.\n\nThus then we see, that personal identity may with truth be predicated of a compound being, though the material part be in a perpetual flux, provided the immaterial part remain unchanged; and that of such a being only is a resurrection from the dead possible.\u2014For since the motions of the brain do nothing more than excite to energy the permanent powers of the mind, it is of no sort of consequence to that energy, whether these motions be continued by the same numerical atoms, or by a perpetual succession of atoms arranged and combined in the very same manner. We shall, therefore, be the same persons at the resurrection as at present, whether the mind be united to a particular system composed of any of the numberless atoms which have in succession made parts of our present bodies, or to a system composed of totally different atoms, provided that new system be organized in exactly the same manner with the brain or material vehicle, which is at present the immediate instrument of perception. This (we say) is self-evident; but were the immaterial part to change with the changing body, a resurrection of the same persons would be plainly impossible.\n\nCHAP. IV. Of the Immortality of the Soul.\n\nWherever men have been in any degree civilized, and in some nations where they have been in the most savage state, it has been the general persuasion, that the mind or soul subsists after the dissolution of the body. The origin of this persuasion, about which disputes have been raised, no Christian hesitates to attribute to revelation. The Egyptians, from whom the Greeks derived many of their theological and philosophical principles, appear to have taught the immortality of the soul, not as a truth discovered by the exertions of human reason, but as a dogma derived to them from the earliest ages by tradition. This indeed may be confidently inferred from the character and conduct of their first Greek disciples. Those early wise men who fetched their philosophy immediately from Egypt, brought it home as they found it, in detached and independent plats. Afterwards, when schools were formed, and when man began to philosophize by hypothesis and system, it was eagerly inquired upon what foundation the belief of the soul's immortality could rest; and this inquiry gave rise to the various disquisitions concerning the substance of the soul, which have continued to exercise the ingenuity of the learned to the present day. It was clearly perceived, that if consciousness, thought, and volition, be the result of any particular modification of matter and motion, the living and thinking agent must perish with the dissolution of the system; and it was no less evident, that if the being which perceives, thinks, and wills, be not material, the mind of man may subsist after the resolution of the body into its component particles. The discovery of the immateriality of the mind was therefore one step towards the proof of its immortality; and in the opinion of many philosophers, whose hopes ought to rest on a surer basis, it was alone a complete proof.\u2014\"They who hold sensitive perception in brutes (says a pious writer)\"\nOf the In writer *) to be an argument for the immateriality of mortality of their souls, find themselves under the necessity of allowing those souls to be immortal.\"\n\n* See the Procedure, not themselves under any such necessity. Whatever Extent, and Limits of the Under- flanding.\n\nThe philosophers of ancient Greece, however, felt Procedure, not themselves under any such necessity. Whatever Extent, and Limits of the Under- flanding.\n\nWhatever were their opinions respecting the souls of brutes, they clearly perceived that nothing which had a beginning of existence could be naturally immortal, whether its subsistence were material or immaterial.\u2014 \"There never was any of the ancients before Christianity (says the accurate Cudworth), that held the soul's future permanency after death, who did not likewise assert its pre-existence; they clearly perceiving, that if it were once granted that the soul was generated, it could never be proved but that it might be also corrupted. And, therefore, the assertors of the soul's immortality commonly began here, first to prove its pre-existence, proceeding thence to establish its permanency after death. This is the method of proof used in Plato: \u1f18\u03bd \u03c4\u1ff7 \u1f51\u03c0\u1f78 \u1f08\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u1fc7 \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u1fb7, \u1f45\u03c4\u03b5 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf \u1f00\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9, \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f04\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f14\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd. Our soul was somewhere before it came to exist in this human form, and thence it appears to be immortal, and as such will subsist after death.\n\nTo give this argument for immortality any strength, it must be taken for granted, not only that the soul existed in a prior state, but that it existed from all eternity; for it is obvious, that if it had a beginning in any state, it may have an end either in that state or in another. Accordingly, Plato affirms in plain terms its eternity and self-existence, which, as we learn from Cicero, he infers from its being the principle of motion in man. Quin etiam ceteris, quae moventur, hic fons, hoc principium est movendi. Principium autem nulla est origo. Nam ex principio oriuntur omnia: ipsum autem nulla ex re alia nasci potest: nec enim efficit id principium, quod gignatur et aliunde.\" This, it must be acknowledged, is very contemptible reasoning; but the opinion which it was intended to prove was held by all the philosophers. They were unanimous in maintaining the subsistence of the soul, though not its personality, to be eternal \u00e0 parte ante as well as ad partem post; and Cicero, where he tells us that this opinion passed from Pherecydes Syrus, to Pythagoras, and from Pythagoras to Plato, expresses their notion of the soul's duration by the word sempiternus \u2020, which, in its original and proper sense, is applicable only to that which has neither beginning nor end.\n\nIndeed none of the philosophers of ancient Greece appear to have believed a creation (see CREATION) possible: for it was a maxim universally received among them, De nihilo nihil fit, in nihilum nil posse reverti; or the Im- that nothing can come from nonentity, or go to nonentity, mortality of the Soul. This maxim, as held by the theistical philosophers, the learned Cudworth labours to interpret in a sense agreeable to our notions of the origin of the world; but the quotations urged by himself must convince every competent reader that on this occasion he labours in vain. For instance, when Aristotle writes of Parmenides and Melissus, that \u03b5\u1f30\u03b4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f50\u03b8\u1f7a\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c6\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u1f61\u03c2 \u03a6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c3\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u1f41\u03c3\u03af\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2, they say that no real entity is either made or destroyed; what can be his meaning, but that those philosophers taught that nothing could be either created or annihilated? He tells the same thing of Xenophanes and Zeno, when he says that it was a fundamental principle of their philosophy\u2014\u03bc\u1f74 \u03b5\u1f51\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd\u2014that it is impossible that any thing should be made out of nothing. And of Empedocles, when he relates \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c4\u03b7 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u1f41\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b5\u1fd6 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u1ff7 \u03bc\u1f72\u03bd \u1f40\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u1ff3 \u03bc\u03b7\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c4\u03b5 \u1f10\u03be \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u2014That he acknowledges the very same thing with other philosophers, viz. that it is impossible that any thing should be made out of nothing, or perish into nothing. But it is needless to multiply quotations respecting the opinions of single philosophers. Of all the physiologists before himself and Plato, Aristotle says, without exception, \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf \u1f10\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u03c5\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03b4\u03cc\u03be\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2, \u1f65\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf\u1f54\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03b5\u1f50\u03b8\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u1f00\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u2014That they agree in this opinion, that it is impossible that any thing should be made out of nothing; and he calls this the common principle of naturalists; plainly intimating, that they considered it as the greatest absurdity to suppose that any real entity in nature could either be brought from nothing or reduced to nothing.\n\nThe author of the Intellectual System, in order, perhaps, to hide the impiety of this principle, endeavours to persuade his readers, that it was urged only against the hypothesis of forms and qualities of bodies considered as real entities, distinct from matter. But how it could be supposed to militate against that particular opinion, and not against the possibility of all creation, is to us perfectly inconceivable. The father of the school which analyzed body into matter and form, together with by far the greater part of his followers, taught the eternity of both these principles (I.); and therefore maintained, as strenuously as any atomist, the universal maxim, De nihilo nihil fit. Even Plato himself, whose doctrine of ideas is supposed to wear a more favourable aspect than Aristotle's forms to the truths of revealed religion, taught the eternity of matter; but whether as a self-existing substance, or only as an emanation from the Deity, is a question which has\n\n\u2020 Tufcul. lib. i. cap. 23.\n\n\u2021 Tufcul. lib. i.\n\n(1.)

For as the world is the best of all works, so is God the best of all causes. Nevertheless, the substance or matter out of which the world was made, was not itself made, but was always ready at hand, and subject to the artificer, to be ordered and disposed by him. For the making of the world was not the production of it out of nothing, but out of an antecedent bad and disorderly state, like the making of a house, garment, or statue.\n\nIf, then, this be a fair representation of the sentiments of Plato, and surely the author understood those sentiments better than the most accomplished modern scholar can pretend to do, nothing is more evident, than that the founder of the academy admitted of no proper creation, but only taught that the matter which had existed from eternity in a chaotic state, was in time reduced to order by the Demiurgus or Supreme Being. And if such were the sentiments of the divine Plato, we cannot hesitate to adopt the opinion of the excellent Moli\u00e8re, which the reader will probably be pleased to have in his own words: \"Si \u00e0 Juda\u00efs difformis, necfio non nulli ut Aristoteles, formam et materiae simul hujus orbis, aliui vero, quorum princeps facile Plato, materiam tantum eternam, formam vero, \u00e0 Deo commparatam, dixerunt.\"\n\nNow, it is a fact to generally known, as not to stand in need of being proved by quotations, that there was not among them a single man who believed in the existence of mind as a being more excellent than matter, and essentially different from it, who did not hold the superior of at least equal antiquity with the inferior substance. So true is this, that Synesius, though a Christian, yet having been educated in one of the schools of philosophy, could not, by the hopes of a bishopric, be induced to dissemble this sentiment: \u03bf\u1f50\u03b4\u1f72 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f30\u03b4\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f02\u03bd \u1f00\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03c9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5 \u1f14\u03bc\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u1f51\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c8\u03b1\u03c2. \u2014I shall never be persuaded to think my soul younger than my body. This man probably believed, upon the authority of the scriptures, that the matter of the visible world was created in time; but he certainly held with his philosophical matters, that his own soul was as old as any atom of it, and that it had consequently existed in a prior state before it animated his present body.\n\nThose who maintained that the world was uncreated, maintained upon the same principle that their souls were uncreated likewise; and as they conceived all bodies to be formed of one first matter, so they conceived all souls to be either emanations from the one first Mind, or discrepant parts of it. Aristotle, who distinguishes between the intellectual and sensitive souls, says expressly, that it \"enters from without, and is divine;\" adding this reason for his opinion, that \"its energy is not blended with that of the body\u2014\u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bd\u1fe6\u03bd \u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u1f04\u03c6\u03b7\u03bd\u03b5 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f34\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u1f05\u03c0\u03b1\u03be \u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u1f36\u03b4\u03b5 \u03c4\u1fc7\u03c2 \u1f04\u03bd\u03c9 \u03c4\u03b5 \u1f10\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03b9\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5 \u1f10\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03b9\u03c2.\" As to the De Generate Stoics, Cleanthes held (as Stoicisms informs us), that \"everything was made out of one, and would be again resolved into one.\" But let Seneca speak for them all: \"Quid est autem, cur non extimiles in eo divini aliquod existeret, qui Dei pars est? Totum hoc, quo continetur, et unum est, et Deus: et facit ejus membra\u2014Why should you not believe some thing to be divine in him, who is indeed part of God? That whole in which we are contained is one, and that one is God; we being his companions and members.\" Epictetus says, The souls of men have the nearest relation to God, as being parts or fragments of him, discarded and torn from his substance\u2014\u1f10\u03be\u03b5\u03c1\u03b7\u03bc\u03ce\u03b8\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd \u03c4\u1ff7 \u03b8\u03b5\u1ff7, \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f30\u03b4\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f00\u03c6\u1fc6\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd \u1f03 \u1f26\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1ff7. Plato writes to the very same purpose, when, without any softening, he frequently calls the soul God, and part of God. And Plutarch says, that \"Pythagoras and Plato held the soul to be immortal; for that, launching out into the soul of the universe, it returns to its parent and original\u2014\u03a0\u03c5\u03b8\u03b1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2, \u03a0\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd, \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03c0\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u1fd6 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u1f30\u03b4\u03af\u03bf\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f55\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2, \u1f00\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03c9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u1f72 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9.\" Plutarch declares his own opinion to be, that \"De Plato, the soul is not so much the work and production of itself Philo, God, as a part of him; nor is it made by him, but \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03b2\u03bf\u03ae\u03b8\u03b7, from him, and out of him: \u1f51\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f30\u03b4\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f10\u03be\u03b5\u03c1\u03b7\u03bc\u03ce\u03b8\u03b7, lib. iv. cap. 7, \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f30\u03b4\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f00\u03c6\u1fc6\u03ba\u03b5\u03bd \u1f03 \u1f26\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1ff7. But it is needless to multiply quotes. Plato delivers the common sentiments of his Greek masters on this head, when he says \u1f18\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4., \"A natione, lib. adiutum deorum, ut docilissimus sapientissimique placuit habuisse animos et libatos habemus.\" And again: \"Humanus autem animus decerptus ex mente divina: cum ali\u00f2 nullo, nisi cum ipso Deo (si hoc fas est dictu), comparari potest.\"\n\nWhilst the philosophers were thus unanimous in distinguishing the soul to be a part of the self-existent God, they differed in opinion, or at least expression as to the mode of its separation from its divine parent. Cicero and the Stoics talk as if the Supreme Mind were extended, and as if the human soul were a part literally torn from that mind, as a limb can be torn from the body. The Pythagoreans and Platonists seem to have considered all souls as emanations from the divine Substance rather than as parts torn from it, much in the same way as rays of light are emanations from the sun. Plato, in particular, believed in two self-existent principles, God and matter. The former he considered as the supreme Intelligence, incorporeal, without beginning, end, or change; and distinguished it by the appellation of \u1f21 \u03b5\u1f50\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1, the Good. Matter, as subsisting from eternity, he considered as without any one form or quality whatever, and as having a natural tendency to disorder. Of this chaotic mass God formed a perfect world, after the eternal pattern in his own mind, and endowed it with a soul or emanation from himself. In the language of Plato, therefore, the universe being animated by a soul which proceeds from God, is called the soul of God;\nOf the Immortality of Bodies, are Gods. The human soul, according to him, is derived by emanation from God, through the intervention of this soul of the world; and receding farther from the first intelligence, it is inferior in perfection to the soul of the world, though even that soul is debauched by some material admixture. To account more fully for the origin and present state of human souls, Plato supposes*, that \"when God formed the universe, he separated from the soul of the world inferior souls, equal in number to the stars, and assigned to each its proper celestial abode; but that those souls, (by what means, or for what reason, does not appear), were sent down to the earth into human bodies, as into sepulchres or prisons.\" He ascribes to this cause the depravity and misery to which human nature is liable; and maintains, that it \"is only by disengaging itself from all animal passions, and rising above sensible objects, to the contemplation of the world of intelligence, that the soul of man can be prepared to return to its original state.\" Not inconsistently with this doctrine, our philosopher frequently speaks of the soul of man as consisting of three parts: or rather he seems to have thought that man has three souls; the first the principle of intelligence, the second of passion, and the third of appetite (at); and to each he assigns its proper place in the human body. But it was only the intellectual soul that he considered as immortal.\n\nAristotle taught, in terms equally express, that the human soul is a part of God, and of course that its substance is of eternal and necessary existence. Some of his followers, indeed, although they acknowledged two first principles, the active and the passive, yet held, with the Stoics, but one substance in the universe; and to reconcile these two contradictory propositions, they were obliged to suppose matter to be both active and passive. Their doctrine on this subject is thus delivered by Cicero: \"De natura ita dicebant, ut eam dividere in tres duas, ut altera effet efficiens, altera autem quasi huic se praebens, ea quae efficieretur aliquid. In eo, quod efficeret, vim effe celebant; in eo autem quod effeceret, materiam quandam; in utroque tamen utrumque. Neque enim materiam ipsum cohaere possit, si nulla vi contineretur, neque vim sine aliqua materia; nihil enim, quod non aliqui effe cogatur.\" They divided nature into two things, as the first Academic principles; one whereof is the efficient or artificer, the other the matter, that which offers itself to him for things to be made out of it. In the efficient principle, they acknowledged active force; in the passive, a certain matter; but so, that in each both of these were together: forasmuch as neither the matter could cohere together unless it were contained by some active force, nor the active force consist of itself without matter; because that is nothing which may not be compelled to be somewhere. Agreeably to this strange doctrine, Arrian, the interpreter of Epictetus, says of himself, \u1f10\u03b3\u1f7c \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2, \u1f10\u03b3\u1f7c \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u1f14\u03c7\u03c9, \u1f10\u03b3\u1f7c \u03bd\u03cd\u03ba\u03c4\u03b1, \u1f10\u03b3\u1f7c \u1f21\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1, \"I am a man (a part of the sun or universe), as an hour is part of the day.\"\n\nAristotle himself is generally supposed to have believed in the eternal existence of two substances, mind and matter; but treating of the generation of animals, he says, \u1f45\u03c4\u03b9 \u03c0\u1fb6\u03c3\u03b9 \u03b2\u03af\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f04\u03bd\u03c5\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9, \u1f65\u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03c0\u1fe6\u03c1 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03c0\u1fe6\u03c1 \u1f04\u03bd\u03c5\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u1fb6\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03c7\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9.\u2020 De Generatione Animalium there is a certain animal heat, so as that at once after a manner all things are full of mind; wherefore Animals, when they have received a portion of that heat, This heat, from which, according to Cicero\u2021, the Stagyrite\u2020\u2020 Tisotus derived all souls, has, it must be confessed, a very material appearance; insomuch that the learned Maimonides seems to have been doubtful whether he admitted of any immaterial principle in man; but for this doubt there appears to us to be no solid foundation. Aristotle expressly declares, that this heat is not fire nor any such power, but a spirit which is in the seeds or elementary principles of bodies; \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf \u03b4\u1f72 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03c0\u1fe6\u03c1, \u03b5\u1f30\u03b4\u1f7c\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f36\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9, \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u1f70 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2.\u2021 And as the excellent person himself\u2021\u2021 De Generatione Animalium acknowledges (N), that Aristotle taught the existence of two principles, God and matter, not indeed substantiation, lib. ii. ing c. 3.\n\n---\n\n* Enfield's Abridgment of Brucker's History of Philosophy.\n\n\u2020 Cicero's Tusculan Questions, lib. i. cap. 10.\n\n\u2021 Cicero's Tusculan Questions, lib. iii. cap. 10.\n\n\u00a7 Non cum illis componi profus potest Aristoteles, qui una rerum separatae statuunt principia, Deum\nOf the immortal soul separately, but eternally linked together by the mortal soul; we think it follows undeniably, that this heat, from which he derived all souls, must be that mind which he called God, and which he considered as the actuating soul of the universe.\n\nUpon these principles neither Aristotle nor the Stoics could believe in Plato, that in the order of nature there was first an emanation from the Supreme Mind to animate the universe, and then through this universal soul other emanations to animate mankind. The Stagyrite believed, that the Supreme Mind himself is the soul of the world, and that human souls are immediately derived from him. The genuine Stoics, acknowledging but one substance, of necessity considered both the souls and bodies of men as portions of that substance, which they called \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f00\u03b5\u03af; though still they affected to make some unintelligible distinction between body and mind. But however the various schools differed as to those points, they were unanimous as to the soul's being a part of the self-existing Substance; and Cicero gives their whole system from Pacuvianus in words which cannot be misunderstood:\n\nQuicquid est hoc, omnia animat, format, alit, auget, creat,\nSepelit, recipitque in se se omnia, omniumque idem\nest Pater:\nIndidemque eadem, quae oriuntur de integro, atque\neodem occidunt.\n\nTo these verses he immediately subjoins the following query: \"Quid est igitur, cur, cum domus fit omnium una, eaque communis, cumque animi hominum semper\nsunt, futurique sint, cur ille quid ex quoque evaniat, et quid quamquam rem significet, perspicere non possint?\" And upon the same principle he elsewhere argues, not merely for the immortality, but for the eternity and necessary existence of the soul: \"Animos\nrum nulla in terris origo inveniri potest: His enim in\nnaturis nihil inefi, quod vim memoriae mentis, cognitio-\nnis habeat; quod et praeterita tenent, et futura provi-\ndeat, et completi posset praesentia; quae sola divina\nsunt. Nec inveniatur unquam, unde ad hominem venire possint, nisi a Deo. Ira quicquid est illud, quod\nfemit, quod sapis, quod vult, quod viget, celeste et di-\nvinum est; ob eamque rem \u00e6ternum sit necesse\nest.\" This was indeed securing the future permanency of the soul in the most effectual manner; for it is obvious, that what had not a beginning can never have an end, but must be of eternal and necessary existence.\n\nBut when the ancients attributed a proper eternity to the soul, we must not suppose that they understood it to be eternal in its distinct and personal existence. They believed that it proceeded or was derived in time from the substance of God, and would in time be again resolved into that substance. This they explained by a close vessel filled with sea water, which swimming a while upon the ocean, does, on the vessel's breaking, flow in again, and mingle with the common mass. They only differed about the time of this reunion; the greater part holding it to be at death; but the Pythagoreans not till after many transmigrations. The Platonists went between these two opinions; and rejoined pure and unpolluted souls immediately to the Universal Spirit; but those which had contracted much defilement, were sent into a succession of other bodies, to be purified and purified, before they returned to their parent substance.\"\n\nA doctrine similar to this of Plato has been held from time immemorial by the Brahmans in India, whose sacred books teach, \"That intellect is a portion of the great soul of the universe, breathed into all similar creatures, to animate them for a certain time; that after death it animates other bodies, or returns like a drop into that unbounded ocean from which it first arose; that the souls of men are distinguished from those of other animals, by being endowed with reason and with a consciousness of right and wrong; and that the soul of him who adheres to right as far as his powers extend, is at death absorbed into that divine essence, never more to re-animate flesh. On the other hand, the souls of those who do evil, are not at death disengaged from all the elements; but are immediately clothed with a body of fire, air, and akasa (a kind of celestial element, through which the planets move, and which makes no resistance) in which they are for a time punished in hell. After the season of their grief is over, they reanimate other bodies; and when they arrive through these transmigrations at a state of purity, they are absorbed into God, where all passions are utterly unknown, and where consciousness is lost in bliss.\"\n\nWhether the Greeks derived their notions of the divinity and transmigration of souls from the east, or whether both they and the Brahmans brought the same doctrines at different periods from Egypt, it is foreign to the purpose of this article to inquire. Certain it is, that the philosophers of Greece and India argued in the very same manner, and upon the very same principles, for the natural immortality of the soul; and compatible that the immortality which they taught was wholly with a future state of the soul, and with a future state of rewards and punishments. That this is true of the doctrine of the Brahmans, is evident from the last-quoted sentence: for if the soul, when absorbed into the Divine essence, loses all consciousness of what it did and suffered in the body, it cannot possibly be rewarded for its virtues practised upon earth. That the philosophers of Greece taught the same cessation of consciousness, might be inferred with the utmost certainty, even though we had not Aristotle's express declaration to that purpose: For as they all believed their souls to have existed before they were infused into their bodies, and as each must have been conscious that he remembered nothing of his former state (o), it was impossible to avoid concluding,\n\nDeum et materiam. Aristissime enim utrumque hoc initium conjunxit Stagyrita, atque ipsa naturae necessitate Deum cohaerere cum mole hac corporea putavit.\" Cudworth's Intellectual System, Book i. Chap. iv. Sect. 6.\n\n(o) This is expressly acknowledged by Cicero, though he held with his Greek masters the eternity of the soul.\nOf the including, that in the future state of his soul as little would be remembered of the present. Accordingly Aristotle teaches, that \"the agent intellect only is immortal and eternal, but the passive corruptible,\"* \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u1ff7 \u1f00\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u1fc7 \u1f41 \u1f00\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03ad\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9. Cudworth thinks this a very doubtful and obscure passage; but Warburton, whose natural acuteness often discovered the sense of ancient authors when it had escaped the sagacity of able scholars, has completely proved, that by the agent intellect is meant the substance of the soul, and by the passive its particular perceptions. It appears therefore that the Stagyrite, from the common principle of the soul's being a part of the Divine substance, draws a conclusion against a future state of rewards and punishments; which though all the philosophers (except Socrates) embraced, yet all were not so forward to avow.\n\nThat the hypothesis of the soul's being a part of the Divine substance is a gross absurdity, we surely need not spend time in proving. The argument long ago urged against it by St Austin must ere now have occurred to every reader. In the days of that learned father of the church, it was not wholly given up by the philosophers; and in his excellent work of the City of God, he thus exposes its extravagance and impiety: \"Quid infelicius credi potest quam Dei partem vapulare, cum puer vulgatus? Jam vero partes Dei fieri falsae, iniquae, impiae, atque omnino damnabiles, quis terre potest nisi qui prorius infant?\" But though this hypothesis be in the highest degree yet the only principle absurd and wholly untenable, we apprehend it to be the from which only principle from which the natural or essential immortality of the soul can possibly be inferred. If the soul had a beginning it may have an end; for nothing can be more evident than that the being which had not existence of itself cannot of itself have perpetuity of existence. Human works, indeed, continue in being after the power of the workman is withdrawn from them; but between human works and the Divine there is this immense difference, that the former receive from the artist nothing but their form; whereas the latter receive from the Creator both their form and their subsistence. Forms are nothing but modifications of substance; and as substances depend upon God and not upon man, human works are continued in being by that fiat of the Creator, which made the substances of which they are composed susceptible of different forms, and of such a nature as to retain for a time whatever form may be impressed upon them. Human works therefore are continued in being by a power different from that by which they are finished; but the works of God depend wholly upon that power by which they were originally brought into existence; and were the Creator to withdraw his supporting energy, the whole creation would sink into nothing.\n\nSelf-evident as this truth certainly is, some eminent philosophers seem to have questioned it. \"No substance or being (says Mr Baxter*) can have a natural tendency to annihilation, or to become nothing. That of the being which once exists should cease to exist is a mortality of real effect, and must be produced by a real cause: the soul. But this cause could not be planted in the nature of any substance or being to become a tendency of its nature; for it could not be a free cause, otherwise it must be a being itself, the subject of the attribute freedom, and therefore not the property of another being; nor a necessary cause, for such a cause is only the effect of something imposing that necessity, and so no cause at all.\"\n\nThat the author's meaning in this argument is good, I cannot, we think, be controverted; but he has not expressed himself with his usual accuracy. He seems to confound causes with the absence of causes, and the effects of the former with the consequences of the latter. The visible world was brought into existence by the actual energy of the power of God; and as the visible world had nothing of itself, it can remain in existence only by a continuance of the same energy. This energy therefore is at the present moment as real a cause as it was six thousand years ago, or at any period when it may have been first exerted; and the visible world is its real and permanent effect. But would the ceasing of this energy be likewise a cause? It would certainly be followed with the annihilation of the visible world, just as the withdrawing of the sun-beams would be followed with darkness on the earth. Yet as no one has ever supposed that darkness, a nonentity, is a positive effect of the sun or of his beams, but only a mere negative consequence of their absence; so, we think, no one who believes in creation can consider that destruction which would inevitably follow the withdrawing of the energy by which all things are upheld, as the positive effect of a contrary energy, or as anything more than a negative consequence of the ceasing of that volition or energy of power by which God at first brought things into existence. For \"where the foundation of existence lies wholly in the power of an infinite Being producing, the ground of the continuance of that existence must be wholly in the same power conserving; which has, therefore, with as much truth as frequency, been styled a continued creation (v).\"\n\nThe force of this reasoning Mr Baxter certainly saw, and when he said, that \"a tendency to persevere in the same state of nature, and a tendency to change it, are by him contradistincts, and impossible to be planted in the same subject at once; or, not to urge the contradiction, if the last prevailed, the remaining in the same state for any given time would be impossible. We forget the true cause of all these tendencies, the will of God, which it is absurd to suppose contrary to itself. The tendency in matter to persevere in the same state of rest or motion, is nothing but the will of the Creator, who preserves all things in their existence and manner of existence; nor can we have recourse to any other cause\n\n---\n\n* Inquiry into the Nature of the Human Soul, vol. i. &c. 3.\n\nIn answer to some very foolish assertions concerning the evil of death, he says, \"Ita, qui nondum nati sunt, miseram jam sunt, quia non sunt: et nos ipsi, si post mortem miseri futuri sumus, miseram fuimus antequam nati. Ego autem non commemorini, antequam sum natus, me miserum.\" Tuscul. lib. i. cap. 6.\n\n(*) See Stillingfleet's Origines Sacrae, where this question is treated in a very masterly manner by one of the ablest metaphysicians of the 17th century. See also our article Providence.\nOf the In-cause for the preservation of immaterial substance in its existence. Therefore these tendencies are to be ascribed to the will of God, and it is absurd to suppose them contrary.\"\n\nAll this is unquestionably true. The existence or nonexistence of matter and of created spirits depends wholly upon the will of God; and we cannot suppose him to be willing today the reverse of what he willed yesterday, because we know that all his volitions are directed by unerring wisdom. We have likewise the evidence of experience, that nothing is ever suffered to perish but particular systems, which perish only as systems, by a decomposition of their parts. A being, which like the soul has no parts, can suffer no decomposition; and therefore, if it perish, it must perish by annihilation. But of annihilation there has not hitherto been a single instance; nor can we look for a single instance without supposing the volitions of God to partake of that unfitness which is characteristic of man. Corporeal systems, when they have served their purpose, are indeed resolved into their component parts; but the matter of which they were composed, to far from being lost, becomes the matter of other systems in endless succession. Analogy, therefore, leads us to conclude, that when the human body is dissolved, the immaterial principle by which it was animated continues to think and act, either in a state of separation from all body, or in some material vehicle to which it is intimately united, and which goes off with it at death; or else that it is preserved by the Father of spirits, for the purpose of animating a body in some future state. When we consider the different states through which that living and thinking individual, which each man calls himself, goes, from the moment that it first animates an embryo in the womb, to the dissolution of the man of four score; and when we reflect likewise on the wisdom and immutability of God, together with the various dilutions of corporeal systems, in which we know that a single atom of matter has never been lost; the presumption is certainly strong, that the soul shall subsist after the dissolution of the body. But when we take into the consideration the moral attributes of God\u2014his justice and goodness, together with the unequal distribution of happiness and misery in the present world; this presumption from analogy amounts to a complete moral proof that there shall be a future state of rewards and punishments (q) (see Moral Philosophy and Religion); and if we estimate the duration of the rewards by the benevolence of Him by whom they are to be conferred, we cannot imagine them shorter than eternity.\n\n**Chap. V. Of Necessity and Liberty.**\n\nIn the preceding chapter we have adverted to that great moral proof for a future state, and the immortality of the soul, arising from the relation in which man, as a being accountable for his conduct, stands to a God of almighty power, infinite wisdom, and perfect justice. But the circumstance of accountability implies freedom of agency; for it is contrary to all our notions of right and wrong (see Moral Philosophy), that a man should be either rewarded or punished for actions which he was necessitated or compelled to perform.\n\nHuman actions are of three kinds: one, where we act by instinct, without any view to consequences; one, where we act by will, in order to obtain some end; and one, where we act against will. It is the second kind of actions only which confers upon the agent merit or demerit. With respect to the first, he acts blindly (see Instinct), without deliberation or choice; and the external act follows from the instinctive impulse, no less necessarily than a stone by its gravity falls to the ground. With respect to the last, he is rather an instrument than an agent; and it is universally allowed, that were a strong man to put a sword into the hand of one who is weaker, and then to force it through the body of a third person, he who held the sword would be as guiltless of the murder as the sword itself. To be entitled to rewards, or liable to punishment, a man must act voluntarily; or in other words, his actions must proceed from that energy of mind which is termed volition; and, we believe, it has never been denied, that all men have power to do whatsoever they will, both with respect to the operations of their minds and the motions of their bodies, uncontrolled by any foreign principle or cause.\n\n\"Every man (says Priestley) is at liberty to turn his thoughts to whatever subject he pleases, to consider the reasons for or against any scheme or proposition, and to reflect upon them as long as he shall think proper; as well as to walk wherever he pleases, and to do whatever his hands and other limbs are capable of doing.\" Without such liberty as this, morality is inconceivable.\n\nBut though philosophers have in general agreed with respect to the power which a man has to perform actions as he wills, they have differed widely concerning the extent of this liberty, reflecting the nature of his volitions, the freedom of his actions, whether they are the result of motives, has seldom if ever been questioned; but whether that result be necessary or not so that the agent has no self-determining power to decide between different motives, has been warmly disputed by men equally candid, impartial, and intelligent. The principal writers on the side of necessity are, Hobbes, Collins, Hume, Leibnitz, Lord Kames, Hartley, Edwards, Priestley, and perhaps Locke. On the other side are Clarke, King, Law, Reid, Butler, Price, Bryant, Wollaston, Horlsey, Beattie, and Gregory.\n\n(q) It was by such arguments that Socrates reasoned himself into the belief of a future state of rewards and punishments. He was singular, as we have already observed, in this belief; and he was as singular in continuing himself to the study of morality. \"What could be the cause of this belief, but this restraint, of which his belief was a natural consequence? For having confined himself to morals, he had nothing to mislead him; whereas the rest of the philosophers, applying themselves with a kind of fanaticism to physics and metaphysics, had drawn a number of absurd, though subtle, conclusions, which directly opposed the consequences of those moral arguments.\"\n\nWarburton's Div. Leg., vol. ii.\nTo give a short view of this celebrated question, is all that our limits will permit; and as we do not think ourselves competent to settle the dispute, it were perhaps a thing desirable to give the opposite reasonings in the words of those eminent authors themselves. It must, however, be obvious to the reader, that the style and manner of so many different writers are extremely various, and that to introduce them all into our abstract, would make the whole a mass of confusion. We shall, therefore, select one writer to plead the cause of necessity, supplying his defects from those who, though inferior to him on the whole, may yet have argued more ably on some particular points which the question involves: and to this combined reasoning we shall subjoin such answers as to us appear most conclusive. Hartley, Hume, and Priestley, are perhaps the most profound reasoners on the side of necessity; but there is so much more perspicuity in the arguments of Lord Kames, that we cannot help preferring them, as being on the whole better calculated to give the ordinary reader a fair view of the subject.\n\nInto actions done with a view to an end (says his lordship*), desire and will enter: desire to accomplish the end goes first; the will to act, in order to accomplish the end, is next; and the external act follows of course. It is the will then, that governs every external act done as a mean to accomplish an end; and it is desire to accomplish the end that puts the will in motion; desire, in this view, being commonly termed the motive to act. But what is it that raises desire? The answer is ready: It is the prospect of attaining some agreeable end, or of evading one that is disagreeable. And if it be inquired, what makes an object agreeable or disagreeable? the answer is equally ready: It is our nature that makes it so. Certain visible objects are agreeable, certain sounds, and certain smells: other objects of these senses are disagreeable. But there we must stop; for we are far from being so intimately acquainted with our own nature as to assign the causes.\n\nWith respect to instinctive actions, no person, I presume, thinks that there is any freedom. With respect to voluntary actions, done in order to produce some effect, the necessity is the same, though less apparent at first view. The external action is determined by the will: the will is determined by desire; and desire by what is agreeable or disagreeable. Here is a chain of causes and effects, not one link of which is arbitrary, or under command of the agent: he cannot will but according to his desire; he cannot desire, but according to what is agreeable or disagreeable in the objects perceived: nor do these qualities depend on his inclination or fancy; he has no power to make a beautiful woman ugly, nor to make a rotten carcass smell sweetly.\n\nMany good men, apprehending danger to morality from holding our actions to be necessary, endeavour to break the chain of causes and effects above mentioned; maintaining, that whatever influence desire or motives may have, it is the agent himself who is the cause of every action; that desire may advise, but cannot command; and, therefore, that a man is still free to act in contradiction to desire and to the strongest motives.\n\nThat a being may exist which in every case acts blindly and arbitrarily, without having any end in view, I can make a shift to conceive; but it is difficult for me even to imagine a thinking and rational being, that has affections and passions, that has a desirable end in view, that can easily accomplish this end; and yet after all can fly off or remain at rest, without any cause, reason, or motive, to sway it. If such a whimsical being can possibly exist, I am certain that man is not that being. There is not perhaps a person above the condition of a changeling, but can say why he did so and so, what moved him, what he intended. Nor is a single fact stated to make us believe that ever a man acted against his own will or desire, who was not compelled by external force.\u2014On the contrary, constant and universal experience proves, that human actions are governed by certain inflexible laws; and that a man cannot exert his self-motive power but in pursuance of some desire or motive.\n\nHad a motive always the same influence, actions proceeding from it would appear no less necessary than the actions of matter. The various degrees of influence that motives have on different men at the same time, and on the same man at different times, occasion a doubt, by suggesting a notion of chance. Some motives, however, have such influence as to leave no doubt: a timid female has a physical power to throw herself into the mouth of a lion roaring for food; but she is withheld by terror no less effectually than by cords: if she should rush upon a lion, would not every one conclude that she was frantic? A man, though in a deep sleep, retains a physical power to act, but he cannot exert it. A man, though desperately in love, retains a physical power to refuse the hand of his mistress; but he cannot exert that power in contradiction to his own ardent desire, more than if he were fast asleep. Now, if a strong motive have a necessary influence, there is no reason for doubting, but that a weak motive must also have its influence, the same in kind, though not in degree. Some actions indeed are strangely irregular; but let the wildest actions be scrutinized, there will always be discovered some motive or desire, which, however whimsical or capricious, was what influenced the person to act. Of two contending motives, is it not natural to expect that the stronger will prevail, however little its excess may be? If there be any doubt, it must arise from a supposition, that a weak motive may be resisted arbitrarily. Where then are we to fix the boundary between a weak and a strong motive? If a weak motive can be resisted, why not one a little stronger, and why not the strongest? Between two motives opposing each other, however nearly balanced, a man has not an arbitrary choice but must yield to the stronger. The mind, indeed, fluctuates for some time, and finds itself in a measure loose: at last, however, it is determined by the more powerful motive, as a balance is by the greater weight after many vibrations.\n\nSuch, then, are the laws that govern our voluntary actions. A man is absolutely free to act according to his own will; greater freedom than which is not conceivable. At the same time, as man is made accountable for his conduct to his Maker, to his fellow\nOf Necessity and Liberty.\n\nlow creatures, and to himself, he is not left to act arbitrarily; for at that rate he would be altogether unaccountable: his will is regulated by desire; and desire by what pleases or displeases him.\u2014Thus, with regard to human conduct, there is a chain of laws established by nature; no one link of which is left arbitrary. By that wise system, man is made accountable; by it he is made a fit subject for divine and human government: by it persons of sagacity foresee the conduct of others; and by it the preference of the Deity with respect to human actions is clearly established.\n\nOf the doctrine of necessity, a more perspicuous or plausible view than this is not to be found in any work with which we are acquainted. It is indeed defective, perhaps, as his lordship only hints at the nature of that relation which subsists between motive and action; but from his comparing the fluctuations of the mind between two contending motives, to the vibrations of a balance with different weights in the opposite scales, there is no room to doubt but that he agreed exactly in opinion with Mr Hume and Dr Priestley. Now, both these writers hold, that the relation of motives to volition and action, is the very same with that which subsists between cause and effect in physics, as far as they are both known to us.\n\n\"It is universally allowed (says Mr Hume*), that matter, in all its operations, is actuated by a necessary force; and that every natural effect is so precisely determined by the energy of its cause, that no other effect, in such particular circumstances, could possibly have resulted from it. The degree and direction of every motion is, by the laws of nature, prefabricated with such exactness, that a living creature may as soon arise from the shock of two bodies, as motion in any other degree or direction than what is actually produced by it. Would we, therefore, form a just and precise idea of necessity, we must consider whence that idea arises, when we apply it to the operation of bodies. But our idea of this kind of necessity and causation arises entirely from the uniformity observable in the operations of nature, where similar objects are constantly conjoined together, and the mind is determined by custom to infer the one from the appearance of the other. These two circumstances form the whole of that necessity which we ascribe to matter. Beyond the constant conjunction of similar objects, and the consequent inference from one to the other, we have no notion of any necessity or connexion.\" He then gives a pretty long detail to prove a great uniformity among the actions of men in all nations and ages; and concludes that part of his argument with affirming, \"not only that the conjunction between motives and voluntary actions is as regular and uniform as that between the cause and effect in any part of nature; but also, that this regular conjunction has been universally acknowledged among mankind, and has never been the subject of dispute either in philosophy or common life.\" He afterwards observes, \"That men begin at the wrong end of this question concerning liberty and necessity, when they enter upon it by examining the faculties of the soul, the influence of the understanding, and the operations of the will. Let them first discuss a more simple question, namely, the operations of body, and of brute unintelligent matter, and try whether they can there form any idea of causation and necessity, except that of a constant conjunction of objects, and subsequent inference of the mind from one to another. If these circumstances form in reality the whole of that necessity which we conceive in matter, and if these circumstances be also universally acknowledged to take place in the operations of the mind, the dispute is at an end; at least must be owned to be thenceforth merely verbal. When we consider how aptly natural and moral evidence link together, and form only one chain of argument, we shall make no scruple to allow that they are of the same nature, and derived from the same principles.\u2014Between a connected chain of natural causes and voluntary actions, the mind feels no difference in passing from one link to another; nor is less certain of a future event which depends upon motives and volitions, than if it were connected with the objects present to the memory and senses by a train of causes, cemented together by what we are pleased to call a physical necessity. The same experienced union has the same effect on the mind, whether the united objects be motives, volition and action, or figure and motion. We may change the names of things, but their nature and their operation on the understanding never change.\"\n\nDr Priestley, in words a little different, teaches the very same doctrine which was taught by Mr Hume.\u2014\n\n\"In every determination of the mind (says he*), or in cases where volition and choice are concerned, all the previous circumstances to be considered are the state of mind (including everything belonging to the will itself), and the views of things presented to it; the latter of which is generally called the motive, though under this term some writers comprehend them both. To distinguish the manner in which events depending upon will and choice are produced, from those in which no volition is concerned, the former are said to be produced voluntarily, and the latter mechanically. But the same general maxims apply to them both. We may not be able to determine a priori how a man will act in any particular case; but it is because we are not particularly acquainted with his disposition of mind, precise situation, and views of things. But neither can we tell in which way the wind will blow tomorrow, though the air is certainly subject to no other than necessary laws of motion.\n\n\"It is universally acknowledged, that there can be no effect without an adequate cause. This is even the foundation on which the only proper argument for the being of a God rests. And the necessitarian asserts, that if, in any given state of mind, with respect both to disposition and motives, two different determinations or volitions be possible, it can be so on no other principle, than that one of them shall come under the description of an effect without a cause; just as if the beam of a balance might incline either way, though loaded with equal weights. It is acknowledged, that the mechanism of the balance is of one kind, and that of the mind of another; and, therefore, it may be convenient to denominate them by different words; as, for instance, that of the balance may be termed a physical, and that of the mind a moral mechanism. But still, if there be a real mechanism in both cases, so that there can be only one result...\"\nresult from the same previous circumstances, there will be a real necessity, enforcing an absolute certainty in the event. For it must be understood, that all that is ever meant by necessity in a cause, is that which produces certainty in the effect.\n\nSuch is the nature of human volitions, according to every necessitarian of eminence who has written on the subject since the days of Hobbes: and if this theory be just, if there be a constant and inseparable conjunction of motives and actions similar to that of cause and effect in physics, it is obvious, that in volition the mind is as inert as body is in motion.\n\nThis consequence is indeed avowed and insisted upon by Hume, Priestley, and their adherents; whilst the advocates for human liberty, on the other hand, contend for an absolute exemption of the will from all internal necessity, arising from its own frame and constitution, the impulse of superior beings, or the operations of objects, reasons, or motives, &c. By this they do not mean, that between motives and volitions there is no relations whatever, or that a man can ever choose evil as evil, or refuse good as good. Such an assertion would be contrary to consciousness and universal experience. But what they endeavour to prove is, that the conjunction of motive and volition is not inseparable, like that of cause and effect in physics; that a man may in most cases choose according to any one of two or more motives presented to his view; that by choosing any thing, he may make it in some measure agreeable by his own act, or, to speak more properly, may bend his desire to it; that in volition, the mind is not inert; and that, therefore, we are under no necessity to act in a particular manner in any given case whatever.\n\nThat the conjunction of motive and action is not constant like that of cause and effect in physics, and that by consequence the mind in forming volitions is not inert, has been evinced by Dr Gregory with the force and precision of mathematical demonstration.\u2014Former writers on the side of liberty had often observed, that upon the supposition of the inertia of mind, a man, with equal and opposite motives presented at once to his view, would, during their continuance, remain perfectly at rest, like a balance equally loaded in both scales. The observation is admitted to be just by all the advocates for necessity; but they contrive to evade its consequences, by denying that in any given case a man can be at once afflicted by two equal and opposite motives. Thus, when it is said that a porter, standing with his face due north, must remain in that position at perfect rest, as long as equal motives shall at once be offered to him for travelling eastward and westward, the necessitarians admit the force of the argument; but when it is added that a guinea, offered for every mile that he should travel in each of these opposite directions, ought therefore to fix him at rest till one of the offers be withdrawn, they deny that the desire of gaining the guineas is the whole of the motives which operate upon his mind. He may have, say they, some secret reason which we cannot discern for preferring the one direction to the other; and that reason, added to the guinea, will make him go eastward or westward, just as an ounce thrown into either scale of a balance poised by equal weights will make that scale preponderate. Though we think that this solution of the difficulty can satisfy no man who is not already biased to the necessitarian system; and though, even were it to be admitted, it seems to militate against the constant conjunction of motives and actions, unless it can be proved that the porter must travel the road which he has been necessitated to choose with reluctance and a heavy heart; yet as it may admit of endless quibbling upon ambiguous words, the philosophical world is much indebted to Dr Gregory for an argument which, in our opinion, can neither be overturned nor evaded, and which demonstrates that the conjunction of motive and action cannot be constant and inseparable, like that of cause and effect in physics.\n\nHis reasoning is to this purpose: Suppose a porter to be offered a guinea for every mile that he shall travel directly eastward. If there be no physical cause or moral motive to keep him at rest, or to induce him to move in another direction, there cannot be a doubt, upon either hypothesis, but he will gladly embrace the action proposed, and travel in the direction pointed out to him, till he shall have gained as much money as to satisfy his most avaricious desires. The same thing would have happened, if a guinea had been offered for every mile that he should travel due south. In these two cases taken separately, the relation between the man's motions and his actions would be strikingly analogous to that between a single impulse and motion in physics. Let us now suppose the two offers to be made at the same instant, and the man to be assured that if he travel eastward he can have no part of the reward promised for his travelling to the south, and that if he travel southward he can have no part of the reward promised for his travelling to the east. What is he to do in this case? If his mind be inert in volition, and if the two motives operate upon him with the same necessity that causes operate in physics, it is obvious that the man could travel neither towards the east nor towards the south, but in a diagonal direction from north-west to south-east; and this he must do willingly, although perfectly satisfied that he could gain nothing by his journey. As this inference is contrary to fact and universal experience, the doctor very justly concludes that the premises, from which it is deduced by mathematical reasoning, must be false and absurd; or, in other words, that the relation between motive and action cannot be that of constant conjunction, like the relation between cause and effect in physics.\n\nHe uses many arguments of the same kind, and equally convincing, to prove the absurdity of supposing the inertness of mind, and only an occasional conjunction of motives and actions; but we forbear to quote them, both because we wish his book to be read, and because we think the single argument which we have borrowed from him sufficient to demolish the theory of Priestley and Hume, which rests wholly upon the hypotheses of the constant conjunction of motive and action.\n\nBut is it then not really true, that the external action is determined by the will, the will by desire, and desire by what is agreeable or disagreeable? That the external action is universally determined by the will, is certainly true; but that the will is necessitated and universally determined by the desire is as certainly false. If Potiphar's\nPotiphar's wife was handsome, and made her proposal to Joseph with any degree of female address; and if his constitution was like that of other young men; there cannot be a doubt but that he felt a desire to do what she requested of him: yet we know that he willed to do otherwise, and in direct opposition to his desire fled from the room. Perhaps it may be said, that his volition to flee was the effect of a contrary and stronger desire not to sin against God; but this is confounding the reader, by calling two energies of mind, between which there is little or no similarity, by the same name. He perceived, or knew, that to comply with his mistress's request would be to sin against God; he knew that he ought not to sin against God, and therefore he chose or determined himself not to do it. We can easily conceive how the presence, attitudes, and address, of the lady might be agreeable to him, and excite desire. There may very possibly be more than one of our readers, who, during the course of their lives, have experienced something of the same kind: but could abstract truth be in the same way agreeable, so as to excite in his mind a desire of virtue sufficient to annihilate or banish the desire of the woman? As well may it be said that one sensation can annihilate another, that the beautiful colours of the rainbow can remove the sensation of stench from the mind of him who is plunged into the midst of a dunghill, or that the smell of a rose can make a man insensible to the pain of a stroke inflicted by a bludgeon. Sensitive desire, and the perception of duty, are things so totally different, that to consider them as operating against each other, like different weights in the opposite scales of a balance, is as absurd as to suppose that sound can operate against colour, or colour against smell. A man may prefer found to colour, or colour to smell, and act accordingly; but the determination must be wholly his own, unless these two sensations be themselves either agents or physical causes of the same kind, like the weights in the opposite scales of the balance.\n\nThe advocates for liberty do not pretend, that in matters of importance a man ever acts without some motive or reason for his conduct. All that they insist upon is, that between two or more motives of different kinds he has a liberty of choice, and that he does not always determine himself by that which he knows to be the greatest. Without such freedom, they think men might be often brought into situations where they could not act at all, and where inaction would at the same time be in the highest degree absurd. Thus, were two bags of gold containing each a thousand or ten thousand guineas, to be placed on the same table, before a man whose family is perishing for want, and were the man to be told that he might take either of them, but not both, is it conceivable that he would be held in perpetual suspense between the two? No; he would instantly and with alacrity take up one of them, without feeling the least regret for the want of the other. This action would, indeed, be the consequence of a very powerful motive, the desire to obtain honestly that wealth of which he and his family stood so much in need. That motive, however, being general, would draw him equally to both bags; and it remains with the necessarians to say by what else than a self-determining power he could take either the one or the other. When it is affirmed, that such self-determination would be an effect without a cause, the advocates for liberty cannot help thinking that their antagonists are guilty of advancing as an argument a petitio principii; for the affirmation is true, only if the mind in volition be inert, and the inertia of the mind is the sole question at issue. If the mind be not inert, it is plain, that in consequence of a man's self-determination, no effect would be produced without a sufficient cause. At any rate, motives cannot be causes. In the proper sense of the word, a cause is that which produces an effect; but the production of an effect requires active power; and power being a quality, must be the quality of some being by whom it may be exerted. Power may be dormant, and therefore power without will produces no effect. Are motives, then, real beings endowed with power and will? No; they are only views of things or mental conceptions, which in the strictest sense of the word are passive; and between two motives the mind determines itself, without receiving an impulse from either.\n\nNor is it only between motives of equal force that men have the power of determining themselves. Whoever believes in a future state of rewards and punishments, and yet acts in a manner which he knows to be offensive to Him who is to be the future and final judge, unquestionably prefers to the strongest of all motives, another which even to himself appears to have comparatively but very little strength. Whether there be men who occasionally act in this manner, is a question which can be decided only by an appeal to every one's consciousness. That there are, we can have no doubt; for we never met with a single individual, not biased by system, who was not ready to acknowledge, that during the course of his life he had done many things, which at the time of action he clearly perceived to be contrary to his true interest. Without a self-determining power in the mind, this could never be the case. Did motives operate with the necessity of physical causes, it is obvious that in every possible situation the strongest must constantly prevail; and that he who in certain circumstances had in time past done any particular thing, would on a return of the same circumstances do the very same thing in every time future. Dr Priestley, indeed, wishes to persuade his readers that this is actually the case. \"In every determination of the mind (says he), or in cases where volition and choice are concerned, all the previous circumstances to be considered are the state of mind (including) every thing belonging to the will itself,\" and the various views of things presented to it;\" and he affirms, that \"whenever the same precise circumstances occur twice, the very same determination or choice will certainly be made the second time that was made the first.\" This is an assertion of which no man can controvert the truth; for it is an identical proposition. If in the circumstances previous to the determination of the mind, every thing belonging to the will itself must be included, it is self-evident that he who in any given circumstances has acted a particular part, will on a return of these circumstances act the same part a second time; for this is only saying, that he who on two different occasions shall exert volitions of the same tendency, will not on these occasions exert volitions of which the tendencies are different. But the question\nto be decided is, Whether a man, in the same general state of mind, possessed of the same degree of health, and conscious of the same appetites, mult., in external circumstances perfectly alike, necessarily exert at all times the same volitions. That the human mind is under no such necessity, we think every man's consciousness and experience may abundantly satisfy him; for there are, perhaps, but very few who have not at one time resisted temptations, to which at another they have chosen to yield.\n\nThat there is a relation between motives and actions, must be confessed; but that relation is neither necessity, nor constant conjunction. If it were, all actions would be perfectly rational; and folly, as well as merit and demerit, would be banished from the conduct of men. What is the particular nature of that relation which subsists between the voluntary actions of men, and the motives from which they proceed, can be known to every individual only by an attentive and unbiased reflection on the operations of his own mind. Without this reflection, no man can be made to understand it by the reasonings of philosophers, and with it no man can need the aid of those reasonings. That a self-determining power, such as that for which we plead, contributes to the sum of human happiness, has been shown by Archbishop King and his ingenious translator; who have proved, with the force of demonstration, that the mind can take pleasure in the object of its choice, though that object be in itself neither agreeable nor disagreeable to our natural appetites; and that if it could not, it would be in vain in such a world as ours to hope for any portion of felicity. Into that detail our limits will not permit us to enter; but to the reader who wishes for further information, we beg leave to recommend the last edition of King's Origin of Evil, by Dr Law late bishop of Carlisle; without, however, vouching for the truth of all the opinions advanced by either of those learned writers.\n\nBefore we conclude this chapter, it may be proper to observe, that it is only in volition that we are conscious of any original active power in ourselves, and that without such consciousness we could never have acquired the notion of active power. In our desires and appetites, we neither are active nor suppose ourselves active. Lord Kames, and most necessarians, confound desire with volition; but that they are perfectly distinct is plain from this circumstance, that we daily desire many things which we know to be wholly out of our own power*, whereas no man ever willed what he did not believe to be in his own power. We all desire or wish that our children may be virtuous, wise, and happy; and though we are conscious that it is not in our power to make them so, we cannot banish the desire from our breasts. But madmen only have ever willed virtue, wisdom, and happiness, to any person; and if there was ever a man so extravagantly mad as to exert such a volition as this, he has at the time fancied himself a divinity, and therefore believed that the object of his volition depended upon himself. When the aforementioned, whose character is so admirably drawn by our great master of moral wisdom\u2020, fancied himself the regulator of the weather and the distributor of the seasons, he might will either rain or sunshine as he thought proper, because he considered the object of his volition as depending upon a power imparted to him from heaven; but though he might desire he could not will, the rising or the falling of winds, for these he confessed were not subjected to his authority. In a word, without freedom in volition, power is inconceivable; and therefore it is as certain that we are free agents, as that we have any notion of active powers.\n\nCHAP. VI. Of the Being and Attributes of God.\n\nIt has been already observed, that as of bodies there are various kinds, endowed with various properties; so the probability is, that of minds endowed with different powers, or different degrees of power, the variety may be as great, or perhaps greater. The existence and powers of our own minds are made known to us by consciousness and reflection; and from our dependent state, and the mutability of the objects around us, we are necessarily led to infer the existence of another mind, which is independent, unchangeable, eternal, and the cause of all things which have a beginning of existence. Between that mind and our own, we can hardly avoid believing that there are many orders of \"thrones, dominations, principalities, virtues, powers,\" but as we have no intuitive knowledge of such intermediate beings, and cannot from any thing which we perceive discern the necessity of their existence, they are not properly the object of science. The existence however, and many of the attributes, of One First Cause, are capable of the strictest demonstration; \"for the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things which are made.\"\n\nOf this great truth, the most important by far which can occupy the mind of man, many demonstrations have been given both by divines and by philosophers. We shall lay before our readers such a one as to us appears perfectly conclusive, being founded on the intuitive knowledge which we have of our own existence, and therefore independent of all theories about the nature and reality of the material world.\n\nEvery man, whether he adopt the common theory or that of Berkeley respecting matter, is conscious that he himself exists, and must therefore grant that something now exists. But, if anything exists now *, *See Note., then must something have always existed; otherwise to King's Origin of Evil. that thing which now exists, must either have been created by nothing, i.e. have been caused by no cause, or else it must have created itself, acting before it existed. Both these suppositions are so palpably absurd, that no atheist has avowed them, either among the ancients or the moderns. We must therefore admit, either that there is some one independent being, which now exists, and always has existed; or that the things which we know to exist at present (every man's self for instance), were produced by something which had its existence from something else, which also depended upon some other cause, and so on in an infinite series of caused or successive beings. But this last supposition, though it has been often made, is as grossly absurd as either of the two former. For of this infinite series, either some one part has not been successive to any other, or\nChap. VI.\n\nOf the Be-\n\ning and At-\n\ntributes of\n\nGod.\n\nIf some one part of it was not successive, then it had a first part; which destroys the supposition of its infinity (R). If all the several parts of it have been successive, then have they all once been future; but if they have all been future, a time may be conceived when none of them had existence: and if so, then it follows, either that all the parts, and consequently the whole of this infinite series, must have arisen from nothing, which is absurd; or else that there must be something in the whole besides what is contained in all the parts, which is also absurd.\n\nAs the possibility or impossibility of an infinite series of dependent beings is the main question at issue between the atheists and us, we shall state the preceding reasoning in a manner somewhat different. For this purpose, let us suppose some one to affirm, that the course of generation has had no beginning; and consequently that the number of successive births has been infinite. We would ask such a person, Whether before the birth of Abraham, for example *, there had past an infinite series of generations or not? If not, the course of generation must have had a beginning, which is the conclusion for which we contend. But if the series past was infinite, then at the birth of Joseph the great-grandson of Abraham, it is evident, that more generations were past, and that the number then was greater than that which was supposed to be infinite; so that upon this supposition we have a number that is both infinite and not infinite, which is a manifest contradiction. Should it be said that the number of generations was infinite, as well at the birth of Abraham as at the birth of Joseph; it will then follow, that one infinite may be greater than another of the very same kind; and consequently that an infinite may be bounded, i.e. be finite. But should it be alleged, that the number of births at Abraham's was finite, and became infinite when it reached Joseph's, it will then follow, that one finite number added to another may make an infinite number, which is directly contrary to every possible notion of infinity. We might argue in the same manner against an infinite series of every kind, the very supposition of which involves the most palpable contradictions. See Chap. Of Infinity and Eternity.\n\nFrom the impossibility of an infinite series it necessarily follows, that there exists, and must have existed from eternity, some one independent being, whose duration cannot be commensurate with succession, and to whom the relation of time is not applicable. Here will some atheists presently imagine, that by the same mode of reasoning they may disprove the existence of God: for do not they who thus destroy the eternity of the world, destroy at the same time the eternity of the Creator? If time itself be not eternal, how can the Deity or anything else be so?\n\nIn urging these questions, it must be taken for granted that time is essential to all existence, and that God cannot be eternal otherwise than by a successive flux of infinite time. But it has been already shown (N\u00b0 24.), that successive duration is not essential to existence; that we can even conceive existence without succession; and it may here be added, that if we suppose a perfect being alone in nature, we shall find it impossible to imagine any succession of ideas, any flux of moments, or any alteration or increase whatever in his knowledge and essence. Such duration as we are acquainted with can have no relation to an immutable Being, while supposed to exist alone; but as soon as he determined to exercise his several attributes in the production of something distinct from himself, then, and not till then, have we reason to think that time, succession, and increase, began. These atheistical questions, therefore, instead of containing an objection to the existence of a Deity, afford a plain demonstration of it: for since it is not more evident that something now exists than that something must have existed from eternity; and since it has been shown, that neither the world in its present state, nor time, nor anything capable of change or succession, can possibly be eternal; it follows, that there must necessarily be some Being who, in the order of nature, is before time, and who, in the stability and immutable perfection of his own intelligence, comprehends at once his yesterday, today, and for ever. \"The atheists (says the excellent Cudworth *) can here only * Intellec-\n\nsmile, or make wry faces, and show their little wit in such System, quibbling upon nunc-flans, or a standing now of eternity,\" book I. chap. 5. as if that standing eternity of the Deity (which with so much reason hath been contended for by the ancient genuine thefts) were nothing but a pitiful small moment of time standing still, and as if the duration of all beings whatsoever must needs be like our own: whereas the duration of every thing must of necessity be agreeable to its nature; and therefore, as that whole imperfect nature is ever flowing like a river, and consists in continual motion and changes one after another, must needs have accordingly a successive and flowing duration sliding perpetually from present into past, and always halting on towards the future, expecting something of itself which is not yet in being; so must that whose perfect nature is essentially immutable have permanent and unchanging duration, never losing anything of itself once present, nor yet running forward to meet something of itself which is not yet in being.\"\n\nFrom the eternity of the Supreme Being we necessarily infer his independence or self-existence; for that existent, which never had a beginning of existence cannot possibly have any cause of that existence, or in any manner depend upon any other being, but must exist of itself, or be self-existent.\n\nEternity ad partem post, or necessary existence, or the cannot impossibility of ever ceasing to be, follows from independence: For to the nature of that which exists without any cause, existence must be essential. But a being whose existence is of itself and essential to its nature, cannot be indifferent to existence or nonexistence, but must exist necessarily. And here it may be proper to observe, that the word necessary, when applied to existence, may be taken in two acceptations very different from each other; either as it arises from the relation which the existence of that being, of which it is affirmed, has to the existence of other things; or from the relation which the actual existence of that thing has to the manner of its own existence.\n\n(R) \u1f22 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u1f51\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03ad\u03bb\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd, \u1f08\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4. \u03a6\u03c5\u03c3. lib. viii. cap. 5. sect. 4.\nIn the former sense, when necessity of existence has relation to the existence of other things, it denotes that the supposition of the non-existence of that thing of which necessity is affirmed, implies the nonexistence of things which we know to exist. Thus, some independent being does necessarily exist; because, to suppose no independent being, implies that there are no dependent beings; the contrary of which we know to be true.\n\nIn the second sense, when the necessity of existence arises from the relation which the actual existence of any thing has to the manner of its own existence, necessity means, that the thing, of which it is affirmed, exists after such a manner as that it never could in time past have been nonexistent, or can in time future cease to be. Thus, every independent being, as it exists without a cause, is necessarily existing; because existence is essential to such a being; so that it never could begin to exist, and never can cease to be. For to suppose a being to begin to exist, or to lose its existence, is to suppose a change from nonentity to entity, or vice versa; and to suppose such a change is to suppose a cause upon which that being depends. Every being, therefore, which is independent, i.e., which had no cause of its existence, must exist necessarily, and cannot possibly have begun to exist in time past, or cease to be in time future.\n\nThese two kinds of necessity as applied to existence, though they have been often confounded, are in themselves perfectly distinct: For though a being cannot be necessarily existent in the former sense without being so in the latter also; yet may it be necessarily existent in the latter sense without being so in the former. For any thing that we know to the contrary, there may be two or more beings existing necessarily in the latter sense of the word necessity, i.e., with regard to independence and the manner of their own existence; but in the former sense of the word, i.e., in relation to this system, there can be but one necessarily existent being; for it is obvious that no more are necessary to account for the production of the dependent beings which we know to exist. To suppose the nonexistence of all independent beings, implies the nonexistence of all dependent beings, ourselves, and every thing else; but to suppose the nonexistence of all independent beings except one, involves in the supposition no such absurdity.\n\nThus the phenomena of nature lead us, by the strictest reasoning, to one first cause, which is sufficient for their production; and therefore none but one first cause can in this sense of the word be necessary: And though several more independent beings might possibly exist, yet they would be no gods to us: they would have no relation to us demonstrable by reason, nor we anything to do with them. For if the supposition of their existence were not requisite to the production of this system, which it obviously would not be, we could perceive no necessity for it at all; we could never discover it by our own faculties, and therefore it could be nothing to us. And though two or three such beings should exist, and act in the formation and government of their respective systems, or agree in one; yet till their existence and operations were made known to us, and a natural relation discovered, nothing would be due from us to them. They would have no religious or moral relations to us; and we should have no reason to call more than one of them our creator, preserver, and governor, which is the proper sense of the word God.\n\nTo show in this manner that there is only one eternal self-existent Being which bears the relation of God to us, seems to be going as far as is necessary, or as natural light will lead us. Those who endeavour to demonstrate that there cannot possibly be more than one self-existent Being, either reason in a circle, or proceed upon principles which their antagonists cannot be compelled to grant. When they deduce the Divine unity from independence or omnipotence, they evidently presuppose it in their definition of these attributes; and when they infer it from the nature of space and duration, which they consider as modes of the self-existent Being, they take it for granted, that space and duration have a real existence, independent of us and our thoughts; and that the one is infinite and the other eternal, contrary to what has been already proved, we think, with the force of demonstration. The celebrated Dr Clarke made much use of space and duration in his attempt to demonstrate that there can be but one self-existent Being; but he argues for the same thing from the nature of necessity as applied to existence.\n\n\"Necessity (says he *), absolute in itself, is simple, uniform and universal, without any possible difference, conformity, or variety, whatsoever: and all variety or difference of existence must needs arise from some external cause, and be dependent upon it, and proportionable to the efficiency of that cause, whatsoever it be. All the Being absolute necessity, in which there can be no variation in any kind or degree, cannot be the ground of existence of a number of beings, however similar and agreeing: because, without any other difference, even number is itself a manifest conformity or inequality (if I may so speak) of efficiency or causality.\"\n\nSuch is this great man's first argument from necessity, to prove that there cannot be more than one self-existent Being. But what is this necessity which proves to be in so much? It is the ground of existence (he says) of that which exists of itself; and if so, it must, in the order of nature, and in our conceptions, be antecedent to that being of whose existence it is the ground. Concerning such a principle, there are but three suppositions which can possibly be made; and all of them may be shown to be absurd and contradictory. We may suppose either the subsistence itself, some property of that subsistence, or something extrinsic to both, to be this antecedent ground of existence prior in the order of nature to the first cause.\n\nOne would think, from the turn of the argument which here represents this antecedent necessity as efficient and causal, that it were considered as something extrinsic to the first cause \u2020. Indeed if the words have any meaning in them at all, or any force of argument, they must be so understood, just as we understand Argument of them of any external cause producing its effect. But as an extrinsic principle is absurd in itself, and is besides rejected by Dr Clarke, who says expressly, that \"of query into the thing which derives not its being from any other idea of thing, this necessity or ground of existence must be in Space, Time, Immanency, Sec.\"\n\nLet...\nLet us then consider the first; let us take the substance itself, and try whether it can be conceived as prior or antecedent to itself in our conceptions or in the order of nature. Surely we need not observe that nothing can be more absurd or contradiction than such a supposition. Dr Clarke himself repeatedly affirms, and it would be strange indeed if he did not affirm, that no being, no thing whatever, can be conceived as in any respect prior to the first cause.\n\nThe only remaining supposition is, that some attribute or property of the self-existent Being may be conceived as in the order of nature antecedent to that being. But this, if possible, is more absurd than either of the two preceding suppositions. An attribute is attributed to its subject as its ground or support, and not the subject to its attribute. A property, in the very notion of it, is proper to the substance to which it belongs, and subsequent to it both in our conceptions and in the order of nature. An antecedent attribute, or antecedent property, is a solecism as great, and a contradiction as flat, as an antecedent subsequent or subsequent antecedent, understood in the same sense and in the same syllogism. Every property or attribute, as such, presupposes its subject; and cannot otherwise be understood. This is a truth so obvious and so forcible, that it sometimes extorts the assent even of those who upon other occasions labour to obscure it. It is confessed by Dr Clarke*, that \"the scholastic way of proving the existence of the self-existent Being from the absolute perfection of his nature, is volgo \u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03bd. For all or any perfections (says he) presuppose existence; which is a petitio principii.\" If therefore properties, modes, or attributes in God, be considered as perfections (and it is impossible to consider them as anything else), then, by this confession of the great author himself, they must all or any of them presuppose existence. It is indeed immediately added in the same place, \"that bare necessity of existence does not presuppose, but infer existence;\" which is true only if such necessity be supposed to be a principle extrinsic, the absurdity of which has been already shown, and is indeed universally confessed. If it be a mode or property, it must presuppose the existence of its subject, as certainly and as evidently as it is a mode or a property. It might perhaps a posteriori infer the existence of its subject, as effects may infer a cause; but that it should infer in the other way, a priori is altogether as impossible as that a triangle should be a square, or a globe a parallelogram.\n\nDoubtful, as it would seem, of the force of his first argument, which even those who pretend to be convinced by it acknowledge to be obscure, the doctor gives a second, which we must confess appears to us to be still more obscure, and if possible less conclusive. \"To suppose two or more distinct beings existing of themselves necessarily and independent of each other, implies (he says) this contradiction, that each of them being independent from the other, they may either of them be supposed to exist alone; so that it will be no contradiction to suppose the other not to exist; and consequently neither of them will be necessarily existing. Whatsoever therefore exists necessarily is the one simple essence of the self-existent Being; and whatsoever differs from that is not necessarily existing, because in absolute necessity there can be no difference or diversity of existence.\"\n\nNecessity is used here in two different senses*, both as absolute and relative. In the former, neither of the two beings can exist without the other, i.e., without our supposing the other to exist also, since that is equally necessary. In the latter, either of them may exist alone, i.e., without the help of the other, or without the supposition of the other as requisite to its own existence. The consequence, therefore, that either of chap. 6, them may exist alone, and so neither of them is necessary, is a mere equivocation on necessity, using it both in examined, an absolute and relative sense at the same time.\" But although as this is a question of the highest importance, and as to be equal, the author was a man of great worth, we shall consider his argument upon the supposition that the word necessity has from the beginning to the end of it the same invariable meaning.\n\nIt has been already observed, that there are only two senses in which that word can be applied to the existence of any being; and whether it be here used in the one or the other of these senses, the reasoning, if resolved into a syllogism, will appear to be inconclusive. If the word be taken in that sense of necessity which arises from the relation that dependent beings which we know to exist bear to some one independent Being, the argument will stand thus:\n\nFrom a known effect no more causes can be necessarily inferred than what are sufficient to account for that effect; but One self-existent and independent Being is sufficient to account for all the phenomena of nature; therefore, from the phenomena, &c.\n\nNo more than one such Being can be necessarily inferred to exist.\n\nBut though no more than one independent being can in this sense of the word necessarily exist, it by no means follows from this syllogism, that two or more such beings may not possibly exist. It is, indeed, a plain contradiction to say, that two or more self-existent beings are in this sense necessary; but surely there is no contradiction in saying, that two or twenty such beings are possible. We could not, therefore, by this argument convict a person of absurdity, who should affirm that two or more independent beings actually exist. We might, indeed, deny the existence of them all but one, because one is sufficient to account for those phenomena, from which alone we know that any independent being exists; but because one of them might be supposed to exist alone, so that it would be no contradiction to suppose the others not to exist; we know not how the doctor came to affirm, in direct opposition to his own demonstration, that not one of them would be necessarily existing.\n\nNecessity, as applied to existence, in the other sense of the word, arises, as we have seen, from the relation which the actual existence of the being, of which it may be affirmed, has to the manner of that being's existence. It is the same necessity, we are told*, with *Answar that which is the cause of the unalterable proportion between two and four; and it is considered as the Letter from formal cause or ground of the existence of an independent being. Were it not for the strange expressions Gloucester objection to this account of that necessity by which a being independent undoubtedly exists; but this kind\nOf necessity is a principle which will not support the superstructure which the learned author labours to raise upon it. The same necessity which is the cause of the unalterable proportion between two and four, is likewise the cause of the unalterable proportion between three and six, between four and eight, and between five and ten, &c. But if it can be the cause of so many different proportions of the same kind, why may it not be the formal cause or ground of existence to as many independent beings of the same kind as well as to one? The following syllogism, we apprehend, to be legitimate both in mode and figure, and its conclusion is directly contrary to the proposition which the doctor deduces from the same notion of necessity.\n\nIf necessity, considered as a formal cause or ground of existence, be in one instance of its causality the formal cause or ground of existence to many things of the same kind, it may likewise in every other instance of its causality, be the formal cause or ground of existence to many things of the same kind.\n\nBut such necessity, in that instance of its causality where it is the formal cause or ground of existence to the unalterable proportion between two and four, is the formal cause or ground of existence to many proportions of the same kind.\n\nTherefore, the same necessity in that other instance of its causality, where it is said to be the formal cause or ground of existence to one independent being, undoubtedly may be the formal cause or ground of existence to many independent beings of the same kind.\n\nThus it appears, that necessity, in any sense in which it can be properly affirmed of existence, cannot be the foundation of any argument to prove the imposibility of more than one self-existent being. It is indeed a principle from which we apprehend that no positive conclusion whatever can be deduced by reasoning a priori. That necessity of existence may be predicated of a being which is independent and uncreated, is self-evident; because to the nature of such a being existence is essential. But whilst that nature itself remains wholly incomprehensible by us, it is impossible that we should discover, by our own unsifted reason, whether it can be the nature of only one or of more than one independent being. To argue from necessity, as if it were the cause or ground of existence to such a being,\n\n(c) John Gerhard and John Vossius both cite Gabriel Biel as acknowledging the unity of God to be incapable of rigid demonstration; and with the sentiments of that schoolman, those two learned divines profess their own to agree.\n\nSed Biel (1.

But in a being naturally capable of perfection or absolute infinity, all imperfection or finiteness, as it cannot flow from the nature of that being, seems to require some ground or reason; which reason, as it is foreign from the being itself, must be the effect of some other external cause, and consequently cannot have place in the first cause. That the self-existent being is capable of perfection or absolute infinity must be granted, because he is manifestly the subject of one infinite or perfect attribute, viz. eternity, or absolute invariable existence. In this respect his existence has been shown to be perfect, and therefore it may be perfect in every other respect also. Now that which is the subject of one infinite attribute or perfection, must have all its attributes infinitely or in perfection; since to have any perfections in a finite limited manner, when the subject and these perfections are both capable of strict infinity, would be the aforementioned absurdity of positive limitation without a cause. To suppose this eternal and independent being limited in or by its own nature, is to suppose some antecedent nature or limiting quality superior to that being, to the existence of which no thing, no quality, is in any respect antecedent or superior. And to suppose that there is no such thing as active power in a being which is evidently the fountain of all power, is the grossest of all absurdities. The same method of reasoning will prove knowledge and every other perfection to be infinite in the Deity, when once we have proved that perfection to belong to him at all; at least it will show, that to suppose it limited is unreasonable, since we can find no manner of ground for limitation in any respect; and this is as far as we need go, or perhaps as natural light will lead us.\n\nOf the omnipotence of the supreme Being some philosophers, as well theists as atheists, have talked very absurdly. Hobbes*, with a view to make this attribute appear impossible and ridiculous, affirms \"that God by his omnipotence or infinite power could turn a tree into a syllogism.\" And Descartes\u2020, though certainly no atheist, childishly affirms, that all things whatever, even abstract truth and falsehood, do so depend upon the arbitrary will and power of God, as that if he had pleased, \"twice two should not have been four, nor the three angles of a plain triangle equal to two right ones.\" But the true notion of Omnipotence, so far from implying a power to turn a tree into a syllogism, or to make twice two not equal to four, implies only that the being possessed of it can actually perform whatever can be conceived by the most perfect understanding; conception in this case being the measure of possibility. Now everything may be conceived by a mind sufficiently enlarged which does not involve in it a direct contradiction; but what we clearly discern to imply a contradiction, such as that a thing may be and not be at the same instant, cannot be conceived by any intellect, or made to exist by any power.\n\nAnd thus has this attribute of the Divinity been always stated, not only by the wisest Christians, but also by most of the ancient philosophers themselves, who expressly admit that \"nothing is exempted from the divine power, but only to make that which hath been done to be undone (ii).\"\n\nAnd here it may be asked, Whether creation, in Creation the proper sense of the word (see CREATION), be possible to within the compass of infinite power. All the ancients, the omnipotent philosophers, who were unenlightened by the rays of divine revelation, held that it is not*; ground, Cicero's Disputing their opinion upon this maxim, Ex nihilo nihil fit, iteration on But the maxim will support no such conclusion.\u2014The ancients, or at least the Peripatetic school, with their metaphysics of which we are best acquainted, considered four kinds of causes, the efficient, the material, the formal, and the final; and though they extended the maxim to the first two, if not to all these causes, it is a self-evident truth only when applied to the efficient cause. Without the actual exertion of power, it is indeed most certain that nothing could be brought into existence; but it is so far from being clear that pre-existent matter, or, as Aristotle chose to express himself, a material cause, must be supposed for infinite power to operate upon, that, we think, every man may find complete evidence of the contrary in himself. That sensation, intelligence, consciousness, and volition, are not the result of any modifications of figure and motion, is a truth as evident as that consciousness is not swift, nor volition square. If then these be the powers or properties of a being distinct from matter, which we think capable of the complete proof, every man who does not believe that his mind has existed and been conscious from eternity, must be convinced that the power of creation has been exerted in himself. If it be denied that there is any immaterial substance in man, still it must be confessed, that, as matter is not essentially conscious, and cannot be made so by any particular organization, there is some real thing or entity, call it what you please, which has either existed and been conscious from eternity, or been in time brought from non-entity into existence by an exertion of infinite power.\n\nTo this perhaps some one may object, that upon our own supposition of the inability of the human mind to exert its faculties but in union with some material and organized system, the mind of every man may have existed from eternity without being conscious of its own existence; and that, therefore, we have in ourselves no evidence of creation, but only of the union of two self-existent substances, which in their prior state had been distinct and separate from each other. But such an objection as this, we beg leave to reply, can arise from nothing but misapprehension of our hypothesis, and of the reasons by which we think it supported. We suppose, that to the exertion of the human faculties, a body of some kind or other may be necessary as an instrument, not merely from what we observe of the dependence of perception.\n\n---\n\n* Leviathan, chap. 5.\n\u2020 Resp., ad Objections Sextas, \u00a7 6.\n\n(11) \u03a4\u03bf \u03b4\u1f72 \u03b3\u03b5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd\u1f78\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f30\u03ba\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03be\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u1f74 \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u1f51\u03c0\u1f78 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f08\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6.\n\u039c\u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u1f70\u03bd \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03b5\u1f30\u03c1\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd,\n\u039b\u03cd\u03b3\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b5\u1fd6, \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u1f23\u03bd \u1f21 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03ae.\nArist. ad Licornach. lib. vi. cap. 2.\nOf the Being and Attributes of God.\n\nMetaphysics.\n\nPart III.\n\nBeing true, that the creation of matter appears to be Of the Being impossible, that we are compelled by every thing that we know of it to believe that matter cannot possibly be self-existent.\n\n\"Because it is undeniably certain, concerning our Intelligences (says Cudworth), and all imperfect beings, that none of these can create any new substance, men Book i. are apt to measure all things by their own scantling, chap. 5, and to suppose it universally impossible for any power whatever thus to create. But since it is certain, that imperfect beings can themselves produce some things out of nothing pre-existing, as new cogitations, new local motion, and new modifications of things corporeal, it is surely reasonable to think that an absolutely perfect Being can do something more, i.e., create new substances, or give them their whole being. And it may well be thought as easy for God or an Omnipotent Being, to make a whole world, matter and all, as our own selves, as it is for us to create a thought or to move a finger, or for the sun to send out rays, or a candle light; or lastly, for an opaque body to produce an image of itself in a glass or water, or to project a shadow: all these imperfect things being but the energies, rays, images, or shadows, of the Deity. For a substance to be made out of nothing by God, or a Being infinitely perfect, is not for it to be made out of nothing in the impossible sense, because it comes from him who is all. Nor can it be said to be impossible for anything whatever to be made by that which hath not only infinitely greater perfection, but also infinite active power. It is indeed true, that infinite power itself cannot do things in their own nature impossible; and, therefore, those who deny creation, ought to prove, that it is absolutely impossible for a substance, though not for an accident or modification, to be brought from nonexistence into being. But nothing is in itself impossible, which does not imply a contradiction: and though it be a contradiction for a thing to be and not to be at the same time, there is surely no contradiction in conceiving an imperfect being, which before was not, afterwards to be.\" To call in question the possibility of creation, because we have no adequate conception how a thing can be brought into existence, would be in the highest degree absurd; for it may be doubted, whether we have adequate conceptions of anything except our own ideas and their various relations (1).\n\nThe Being which is self-existent, omnipotent, and God a free omniscient, is not a necessary, but a free agent; for an agent; but\n\n---\n\n(1) \"Ridicula foret et inepta ejus temeritas, qui corporum ideo creationem sibi duceret negandum esse, quod ejus creationis clarum et perspicuum notionem effingere cognitione nobis haud licet.

What, therefore, hath no bounds set to its power, what can have no opposition made to its will, nor restraint laid on its actions, must both will and act freely. \"If the Supreme Cause were not a being endowed with liberty and choice, but a mere necessary agent, then would it follow, as Dr Clarke well observes*, that nothing which is not, could possibly have been; and that nothing which is, could possibly not have been; and that no mode or circumstance of the existence of any thing could possibly have been in any respect otherwise than it now actually is. All which being evidently most false and absurd; it follows, on the contrary, that the Supreme Cause is not a mere necessary agent, but a Being endowed with liberty and choice.\"\n\nTo this reasoning it has been lately replied\u2020, that \"Clarke must have known, that all those who contend against the free agency of the Deity, do of course acknowledge, that nothing could have happened, or does happen, or will happen, but what actually has happened, or doth happen, or will happen; and that it is most false and absurd to deny it.\" It is, therefore, according to the necessarians, absolutely impossible, that at present there could exist upon this earth more or fewer persons than are now actually alive; that the earth could move in any other direction than from west to east; or that there could be more or fewer planets in the solar system. Yet is it most certain, that there have been fewer persons on the earth than there are now; that there is not a cultivated country in Europe which could not contain more people than now inhabit it; that the comets move in very different directions from that of west to east; and that as, till very lately, we conceived only five primary planets in the system, it is evidently possible that the system might contain no more. Upon the supposition, therefore, that the Supreme Being acts under a physical necessity, the same things are possible and not possible at the same time, which is the grossest of all absurdities. It might have been objected with much more plausibility, that the First Cause cannot possibly be free, because he must needs do always what is best in the whole; but it will be seen by and by, that among different created systems, there is no reason for supposing any one absolutely best.\n\nBut though this Being be free, and as such the author of change in other beings, yet he must himself be unchangeable; for all changes have a beginning, and consequently are effects of some prior cause. But there can be nothing prior to the existence of this Being, as he is eternal; neither any cause of it, as he is independent; nor consequently any change in it, except we could suppose him to change himself, which is the same absurdity as to produce himself, i.e. to be at the same time both effect and cause.\n\nOmniscience, as well as some of the foregoing attributes of the Supreme Being, may perhaps be more easily deduced thus\u2021. We find in ourselves such qualities as thought and intelligence, power and freedom, &c. for which we have the evidence of consciousness as much as for our own existence. Indeed it is only by our consciousness of these that our existence is known to ourselves. We know likewise that these are perfections, and that to have them is better than to be without them. We find also that they have not been in us from eternity. They must, therefore, have had a beginning, and consequently some cause, for the very same reason that a being beginning to exist in time requires a cause. Now this cause, as it must be superior to its effect, must have those perfections in a superior degree; and if it be the first cause, it must have them in an infinite or unlimited degree, since bounds, or limitation without a limiter, would, as we have already shown, be an effect without a cause.\n\nIt is indeed obvious, that the omniscience of the Supreme Being is implied in his very existence. \"For all things being not only present to him, but also entirely depending upon him, and having received both their being itself and all their powers and faculties from him, it is manifest that as he knows all things that are, and penetrates every part of their substance with his all-seeing eye, so must he likewise know all possibilities of things, that is, all effects that can be. For, being alone self-existent, and having alone given to all things all the powers and faculties with which they are endued, it is evident that he must of necessity know perfectly what all and each of these powers and faculties, which are derived wholly from himself, can possibly produce. And seeing at one boundless view, or more properly in his own ideas, all the possible compositions and divisions, variations, and changes, circumstances and dependencies of things, all their possible relations one to another, and their dispositions or fitnesse to certain and respective ends, he must without possibility of error know exactly what is best and properest in every one of the numberless possible cases, or methods of disposing things; and understand perfectly how to order and direct the respective means to bring about what he so knows to be in its kind, or on the whole, the best and fittest in the end. This is what is meant by infinite wisdom, or omniscience;\" and it has been readily admitted by every man who has believed in the existence of a God as the creator and preserver of all things.\n\nDoubts, however, have been entertained by theists, God fore- and pious theists, whether omniscience itself can certainly know the future events, which are called contingent events, such as the actions of free agents; and some few there are professing to be even Christians, who have boldly pronounced such knowledge to be impossible. That we have no adequate notion how events, which are called contingent, can be certainly foreknown, must indeed be granted; but we are not, therefore, authorized to say that such knowledge is impossible, unless it can be clearly shown to imply a contradiction. They who suppose that it implies a contradiction, must likewise suppose, that, where there is not a chain of necessary causes, there can be no certainty of any future event; but this is evidently a mistake. \"For let us suppose that there is in man a power of beginning motion, and of acting with what has been of late called philosophical freedom; and let us suppose farther that the actions of such a man cannot possibly be foreknown; will there not yet be in the nature of things, notwithstanding this supposition, the same certainty of event in every one of the man's actions, as if they were ever so fatal and necessary? For instance, suppose the man, by an internal principle of motion, and an absolute freedom of mind, to do some particular action today, and suppose it was...\nOf the possibility that this action should have been foreseen and at-foreseen yesterday, was there not nevertheless the same certainty of event as if it had been foreseen, and absolutely necessary? That is, would it not have been as certain a truth yesterday, and from eternity, that this action was in event to be performed today, notwithstanding the supposed freedom, as it is now a certain and infallible truth that it is performed? Mere certainty of event, therefore, does not in any measure imply necessity.\n\nAnd surely it implies no contradiction to suppose, that every future event which in the nature of things is now certain, may now be certainly known by that intelligence which is omniscient. The manner how God can foreknow future events, without a chain of necessary causes, it is indeed impossible for us to explain; yet some sort of general notion of it we may conceive. \"For, as a man who has no influence over another person's actions, can yet often perceive beforehand what that other will do; and a wiser and more experienced man, with still greater probability will foresee what another, with whose disposition he is perfectly acquainted, will in certain circumstances do; and an angel, with still less degrees of error, may have a further prospect into men's future actions: so it is very reasonable to conceive, that God, without influencing men's wills by his power, or subjecting them to a chain of necessary causes, cannot but have a knowledge of future free events, as much more certain than men or angels can possibly have, as the perfection of his nature is greater than that of theirs.\"\n\nThe distinct manner how he foresees these things we cannot, indeed, explain; but neither can we explain the manner of numberless other things, of the reality of which, however, no man entertains a doubt.\" We must therefore admit, so long as we perceive no contradiction in it, that God always knows all the free actions of men, and all other beings ended with liberty; otherwise he would know many things now of which he was once ignorant, and consequently his omniscience would receive addition from events, which has been already shown to be contrary to the true notion of infinity.\n\nIn a being incapable of change, knowledge has nothing to do with before or after. To every purpose of knowledge and power, all things are to him equally present. He knows perfectly every thing that is, and what to us is future he knows in the very same manner as he knows what to us is present.\n\nThus have we demonstrated the necessary existence of a being who is eternal, independent, unchangeable, omnipotent, free in his actions, and omniscient; and this is the being whom we worship as God. Eternity, independence, immutability, omnipotence, liberty, and omniscience, which seem to be all the natural attributes which we can discover in the divine nature, as they are conceived to be differently combined, make us speak of him in different terms. His enjoying in an absolute manner every conceivable power or perfection, makes us call him a Being infinitely perfect. His being capable of no want, defect, or unhappiness of any kind, denotes him to be all sufficient in himself; and the unlimited exercise of his knowledge and power, demonstrates him to be omnipresent. That such a Being must be incomprehensible by us, and by every creature, is a truth self-evident; and yet in all ages men of the best intentions have been vainly attempting this impossibility.\n\nThe manner of his omniscience, for instance, has been of the subject of much disputation among those who hold and ought to have reflected that they know not how their own minds were present to their own bodies. The celebrated Dr Clarke and his adherents, who considered space as the sine qua non of all other things, insisted that God must be infinitely extended; and that, as wherever his substance is, there his attributes must be, it is thus that his knowledge and power are present with every creature. But this notion labours under insuperable difficulties.\n\nFor if the Divine substance be infinitely extended, then will there be part of it in this place and part not in that. It must be commensurate with all particular divine beings, so that some will occupy more and some less in comparison of its dimensions. By this account it will be very problematical, and peradventure to say, that God is not in heaven, but only a part of him; and that an elephant or a mountain, a whale or a wicked giant, have more of the essence or presence of God with them, than the holiest or best man in the world, unless he be of equal size: all which, as has been well observed, are at least harsh and grating expressions. As the attributes of the Divine Being must be considered in the same manner with his substance, we shall likewise, upon this notion of omnipresence, have a part of his knowledge and power Space, Time, in this place, and a part of them in that; and of these Immensity, parts the one must be greater or less than the other, according to the dimensions of the place with which it is commensurate; which is a supposition that appears to us harsher, if possible, than even the former.\n\nShould it be said that the divine attributes are not to be considered as having parts (though we see not how they can be considered otherwise than as their subject), they must then exist completely in every point of this immense expansion. Be it so; and what follows? Why, every point of this infinitely expanded being will be omniscient and omnipotent by itself; an inch of it will have as much wisdom and power as a yard, a mile, or the whole; and, instead of one infinite wisdom and power, we shall have millions: For these parts of the substance are conceived distinctly, and one individual part is not another, so must the attributes be likewise conceived, and the individual power and knowledge of one part be distinct from that of another.\" And if so, it follows, that one point of this expanded being has equal power and intelligence with the whole; so that the notion of extension being necessary to God's presence with every creature, involves in it the most palpable contradiction. That God is at all times and in all places present with every creature as to have an absolute knowledge of and power over it, is indeed capable of the strictest demonstration; but we think it great presumption to assign the particular mode of his presence, especially such a one as is neither agreeable to the nature of an absolutely perfect Being, nor in the least necessary to the exercise of any one perfection which he can be proved to possess. Philosophers and divines have offered several names for the manner in which God is present with his works; but we choose rather to confess, that the manner of his presence is to us, and probably to every creature, wholly incomprehensible. Nor need we be surprised or staggered at this, when we reflect that the manner in which our own minds are present.\npresent with our bodies is to us as incomprehensible as the manner in which the supreme Mind is present with every thing in the universe. That our minds have a power over our limbs, we know by experience; but that they are not extended or substantially diffused through them, is certain; because men daily lose arms and legs, without losing any part of their understanding, or feeling their energies of volition in the smallest degree weakened. But we need pursue this subject no farther. It has been confessed by one of the most strenuous advocates for the extension of the Deity and all minds, that \"there is an incomprehensibleness in the manner of every thing, about which no controversy can or ought to be concerned.\"\n\nThe moral attributes of God may be deduced from his natural ones, and are immediate consequences of them when exercised on other beings. They may be termed his secondary relative attributes, as they seem to be the perfection of his external acts rather than any new internal perfections. And though the existence of any moral quality or action is not capable of strict demonstration, because every moral action or quality, as such, depends upon the will of the agent, which must be absolutely free; yet we have as great assurance that there are moral qualities in God, and that he will always act according to these qualities, as the nature of the thing admits; and may be as well satisfied of it, as if it were capable of the most rigid demonstration. This important point, however, cannot be so clearly or so firmly established by abstract reasoning as by taking a scientific view of the works of creation, which evince the goodness, holiness, and justice, of their Author, as well as his perfect wisdom and infinite power. The consideration, therefore, of the moral attributes of God, together with his providence, and the duties thence incumbent on man, is the proper business of other articles (see RELIGION, THEOLOGY, and MORAL PHILOSOPHY).\n\nAt present we shall only observe, that by reasoning a priori from his existence and his natural perfections, we must necessarily infer that his actions are the result of unmixed benevolence. Every wise agent has some end in view in all his actions; it being the very essence of folly to act for no end; but there cannot be an end of action which is not either selfish or benevolent. Selfishness is the offspring of want and imperfection, and is therefore the source of most human actions; because men are weak and imperfect beings, capable of daily additions to their happiness. When the thief plunders a house at midnight, when the highwayman robs a traveller on the road; and even when the assassin murders the man who never injured him; it will be found that their actions spring not from an innate desire to inflict misery upon others, but from a prospect of reaping advantage to themselves. The object of the thief and the robber is obvious: it is to gain money, which is the mean of procuring the comforts of life. Even the assassin has always the same selfish end in view: either he is bribed to commit the murder, or he fancies that his horrid deed will remove an obstacle from the way to his own happiness. But they are not vicious men only who act from selfish considerations: much of human virtue, when traced to its source, will be found to have its origin in the desire of happiness. When a man gives his money to feed the hungry and to clothe the naked, he believes that he is acting agreeably to the will of Him to whom he owes his existence; and the poor stand in the same relation; and he looks for a future and eternal reward. By continuing the practice, he soon acquires the habit of benevolence; after which, indeed, he looks for no further reward, when performing particular actions, than the immediate pleasure of doing good. This selfishness of man is the necessary consequence of his progressive state. But the Being who is independent, omnipotent, omniscient, and, in a word, possessed of every possible perfection, is incapable of progression, or of having any affection whatever made to his happiness. He is immutable; and must of necessity have been as happy from eternity; when existing alone, as after the creation of ten thousand worlds. When, therefore, he willed the existence of other beings, he could have nothing in view but to communicate some resemblance of his own perfections and happiness. That he had some end in view, follows undeniably from his infinite wisdom. That he could not have a selfish end, follows with equal certainty from his own infinite perfections; and as there is no medium, in the actions of a wise Being, between selfishness and benevolence, we must necessarily conclude, that the creation was the result of unmixed benevolence or perfect goodness. The other moral attributes of the Deity, his justice, mercy and truth, ought therefore to be considered only as so many different views of the same goodness in the Creator, and various sources of happiness in the creature. These are always subordinate to and regulated by this one principal perfection and brightest ray of the Divinity.\n\nThus we conceive his justice to be exerted on any being no farther than his goodness necessarily requires, in order to make that being, or others, sensible of the heinous nature and pernicious effects of sin; and thereby to bring them to as great a degree of happiness as their several natures are capable of. His holiness hates evil, and abhors all wickedness, only as its necessary consequences are absolute and unavoidable misery; and his veracity or faithfulness seems to be concerned for truth, only because it is connected with and productive of the happiness of all rational beings; to provide the properest means for attaining which great end, is the exercise of his wisdom.\" Such is the view of God's moral attributes, which the abstract contemplation of his natural perfections necessarily gives; and whether this way of conceiving them be not attended with less difficulty than the common manner of treating them under the notion of two infinites diametrically opposite, must be left to the judgement of the reader.\n\nBut if the Creator and supreme Governor of all things be a Being of infinite power, perfect wisdom of evil, and pure benevolence, how came evil into the works of creation? This is a question which has employed the speculative mind from the first dawning of philosophy, and will continue to employ it till our faculties be enlarged in a future state, when philosophy shall give place to more perfect knowledge. To these Johnson's meditations, as has been well observed, humanity is not equal. Volumes have been written on the subject; but we believe that the following extract from the Origin of Evil...\nDr Clarke contains all that can be advanced with certainty, and all that is necessary to vindicate the ways of God to man.\n\n\"All that we call evil (says that able reasoner), is either an evil of imperfection, as the want of certain faculties and excellencies which other creatures have; or natural evil, as pain, death, and the like; or moral evil, as all kinds of vice. The first of these is not properly an evil: for every power, faculty, or perfection, which any creature enjoys, being the free gift of God, which he was no more obliged to bestow than he was to confer being or existence itself, it is plain, that the want of any certain faculty or perfection in any kind of creatures, which never belonged to their nature, is no more an evil to them, than their never having been created or brought into being at all could properly be called an evil.\" To this we may add, that as no created being can be self-existent and independent, imperfection is unavoidable in the creation, so that the evil of defect (as it is most absurdly called) must have been admitted, or nothing could ever have existed but God. \"The second kind of evil, which we call natural evil, is either a necessary consequence of the former, as death to a creature on whose nature immortality was never conferred; and then it is no more properly an evil than the former: Or else it is counterpoised in the whole with as great or greater good, as the afflictions and sufferings of good men: and then also it is properly no evil: Or else it is a punishment; and then it is a necessary consequence of the third and last sort of evil, viz. moral evil. And this arises wholly from the abuse of liberty, which God gave to his creatures for other purposes, and which it was reasonable and fit to give them for the perfection and order of the whole creation: only they, contrary to God's intention and command, have abused what was necessary for the perfection of the whole, to the corruption and depravation of themselves. And thus have all sorts of evils entered into the world, without any diminution to the infinite goodness of its Creator and Governor.\"\n\nBut though evil could not be totally excluded from the universe, are we not authorized to infer, from the infinite power, wisdom, and goodness of the Creator, that the present system is upon the whole the very best system possible? Undoubtedly we are, if of possible systems there can be a best: but this is so far from being evident, that we think it implies a contradiction. A best of beings there is, viz. God, who is possessed of infinite perfections; but there cannot be a best of creatures or of created systems. To prove this, we need only reflect, that wherever creation stops, it must stop infinitely short of infinity; and that how perfect forever we conceive any creature or system of creatures to be, yet the distance between that and God is not lessened, but continues infinite. Hence it follows, that the nature of God and his omnipotence is such, that whatever number of creatures he has made, he may still add to that number; and that however good or perfect the system may be on the whole, he might still make others equally good and perfect.\n\nThe dispute, whether a being of infinite power, wisdom, and benevolence, must be supposed to have created the best possible system, and the embarrassment of men's understandings about it, seem to have arisen from their taking the words good, better, and best, for absolute qualities inherent in the nature of things, whereas in truth they are only relations arising from certain appetites. They have indeed a foundation, as all relations have, in something absolute, and denote the thing in which they are founded; but yet they themselves imply nothing more than a relation of congruity between some appetite and its objects. This is evident; because the same object, when applied to an appetite to which it has a congruity, is good; and bad, when applied to an appetite to which it has no congruity. Thus, the earth and air to terrestrial animals are good elements, and necessary to their preservation: to those animals the water is bad, which yet affords the best receptacle to fishes. Good, therefore, being relative to appetite, that must be reckoned the best creature by us which has the strongest appetites, and the surest means of satisfying them all, and securing its own permanent happiness. And though the subsistence of creatures is chiefly to be regarded as contributing to their perfection, yet we have no way of measuring the perfection of different substances but by their qualities, i.e., by their appetites by which they are sensible of good and evil, and by their powers to procure those objects from which they receive that lenity of things which makes them happy.\n\nIt is plain, therefore, that whatever system we suppose in nature, God might have made another equal absolutely to it; his infinite wisdom and power being able to best make other creatures equal in every respect to any that we know or can conceive, and to give them equal or stronger appetites, and as certain or more certain ways of satisfying them. We see in many cases, that very different means will answer the same end. A certain number of regular pyramids will fill a space; and yet irregular ones will do it as well, if what we take from the one be added to another; and the same thing may be done by bodies of the most irregular and different figures in the same manner: and therefore we may very well conceive, that the answering of appetites, which is all the natural good that is in the world, may as well be obtained in another system as in this; provided we suppose, that where the appetites of the sentient beings are changed, the objects are also fitted to them, and an equal congruity among the parts of the whole introduced. This is so easily conceived, that in an indefinite number of possible worlds, we do not see why it may not be done in numberless ways by infinite power and wisdom.\n\nIf then it be plain, that there might have been many other worlds, or even but one, equal to this in all excellent respects as to goodness, there could be no necessity, by his goodness either physical or moral, that God should create the one rather than the other; because nothing could make the one better, or to him more agreeable, than the other, but his own free choice. Either, therefore, God must be possessed of absolute freedom, or, among a number of possibilities equally perfect, he could not have made a choice, and so nothing would ever have been created. It is not, then, as Leibnitz and others argue, the natural and necessary goodness of some particular things, represented by the divine ideas, which determines God to prefer them to all others, if understood of his first act of producing them; but it is\nis his own free choice which, among many equal potential goods, makes some things actually good, and determines them into existence. When those are once supposed to exist, every thing or action becomes good which tends to their happiness and preservation; and to suppose their all-perfect Author to have any other end in view than their preservation and happiness, is the same absurdity as to suppose that knowledge may produce ignorance; power, weakness; or wisdom folly.\n\nWe have now finished what we proposed under the article Metaphysics. It has swelled in our hands to a large extent; and yet it can be considered as little more than an introduction to that science, which comprehends within its wide grasp every thing existing. The reader who wishes to pursue these interesting speculations, should study diligently the authors whom we have consulted, and to whom we have been careful to refer in the margin. Were we to make a selection, we should without hesitation recommend Aristotle and Plato among the ancients; and Cudworth, Locke, Hartley, and Reid, among the moderns. These philosophers, indeed, on many points, differ exceedingly from one another; but he who wishes not to adopt opinions at random, should know what can be said on both sides of every question.","sp":171,"ep":293},{"h":"METAPLASMUS","t":"in Grammar, a transmutation or change made in a word, by adding, retrenching, or altering a syllable or letter thereof.","sp":293,"ep":293},{"h":"METAPONTUM","t":"or METAPONTIUM, in Ancient Geography, a town of Lucania, on the Sinus Tarentinus, to the west of Tarentum; built by the Pylians who returned from Troy; and where Pythagoras is said to have taught in the time of Servius Tullius.

His talent for poetry was first unfolded by the reading of Tasso; and he began to compose verses at ten years of age. \"A prodigy of this nature (says Metastasio) made such an impression on my master, the celebrated Gravina, that he thenceforth considered me as a plant worthy of being cultivated by his own hands.\" Metastasio was only fourteen years of age when he composed his tragedy entitled Il Giustino; in which he appears too close and scrupulous an imitator of the Grecian drama. Our young poet unfortunately lost his patron in 1717; who left him his heir, \"as being a young man of the most promising abilities.\" Metastasio, at the age of nineteen, being, in consequence of this inheritance, superior to those wants which require the exertions of genius, and to which men of abilities are too often subject, gave full scope to his inclination for poetry. He began his dramatic career with the Didone Abbandonata, which was acted at Naples in 1724; the music was composed by Sarro. He soon acquired such celebrity, that in 1729 he was invited to Vienna by the emperor Charles VI.; who appointed him imperial poet, and granted him a pension of 4000 florins. From that time some of his works were presented at every court festival; and notwithstanding the extreme magnificence of these entertainments, they would now be forgotten were it not for the verses which he composed upon the occasion. The courts of Vienna and Madrid vied with each other in the present which they conferred upon him. From Maria Theresa he received a snuff-box and a port-folio set with diamonds, and a golden candelstick with a screen. Ferdinand VI., king of Spain, informed of the great merit of Metastasio by Farinelli, of whom he was a passionate admirer, sent him a present of a casket mounted with gold, and furnished with the different implements of writing. This favourite of kings and of the muses was of a cheerful temper, and was exceedingly temperate: to this he was probably indebted for the uninterrupted health which he enjoyed, and for the entire possession of his senses and faculties to the most advanced period of old age. He took his meals, arose, and went to bed, always at stated hours. This exactness and order were scrupulously observed even in the most trifling actions of his life. He used to say in jest, that he dreaded hell for no other reason but because it was a place ubi nulius ordo, sed sempiternus horror inhabitat. He had even his stated hours for making verses; to which he scrupulously adhered, without waiting for the moment of poetical enthusiasm. He was equally regular in the duties of the Christian as in the labours of the scholar. His behaviour was that of a true philosopher: his ambition extended no farther than the attainment of literary fame; and he despised every civil mark of distinction. When Charles VI. offered him the titles of Count or of Baron, which add no real worth or dignity to the possessor, but frequently make him appear in a more ridiculous light, he instantly begged the favour that he would allow him still to continue Metastasio. The empress Maria Theresa afterwards wished to bestow upon him the small cross of St Stephen; but he excused himself on account of his age, which would prevent him from attending at the festivals of the order. He was attacked by a fever on the 2d of April 1782; and he died on the 12th of the same month, at the age of 84. Before his death he received the sacrament according to the form of the Roman church; and Pius VI. who was then at Vienna, sent him his apostolical benediction in articulo mortis. He left about 150,000 florins. He composed a great number of tragic operas, and several small dramatic pieces which have been set to music. We have different editions of them in 4to, 8vo, and 12mo; and M. Richelet has published a translation of them into French, in 12 vols, small 12mo.\n\nThe greatest part of Metastasio's writings will confer immortality on their author. His dialogue is natural,\nMetastasio, simple, and easy; his style is always pure and elegant, and sometimes sublime and pathetic. His subjects are noble, interesting, and excellently adapted for representation. He was perfectly acquainted with the resources of his art, and has subjected the opera to rules. He stripped it of its machinery, and of the marvellous, which was fitted to excite the gaze of astonishment, but which gave no instruction to the understanding, and made no impression on the heart. His descriptions are copied from nature; the situations of his characters never fail to raise an interest in the reader, and often excite the tear of pity. His fables are celebrated; his characters are noble and well supported; his plots are excellently conducted, and happily unravelled. \"There are scenes (says Voltaire) worthy of Corneille when he does not declaim, and of Racine when he is not feeble.\" His operas, in point of the pathetic, may be compared with our finest tragedies; and may be read with great pleasure, independent of the charms of the music. We must not, however, expect to find in Metastasio that exact regularity, and that fertile simplicity, which constitutes the excellence of some of our tragic poets: But though he sometimes transgresses the unities of time and place, he always preserves the unity of interest. Notwithstanding all these advantages, some critics will not allow him the merit of invention, which is the first qualification of a poet. They consider him only as a successful imitator of the French tragic writers, from whom a great part of his beauties are borrowed, and place him at the head of the finest wits in Italy, but deny that he possessed genius. He was a fond admirer of the ancients; and this admiration, increasing with the solidity of his understanding, continued to the last period of his life. He recommended reading them, as he himself had done, in a chronological order. His memory was excellent, and continued unimpaired even in old age. Horace was his favourite author, and he could repeat almost the whole of his verses. Metastasio, who, as we have observed, was the pupil of the celebrated Gravina, added a gentleness of character peculiar to himself to the accuracy of thinking and great erudition of his master. His abilities and fame were respected by the critics in general; and whereas the life of most men of letters is one continued warfare, his days happily glided away in tranquillity and peace.\n\nThe circumstance which occasioned the change of his name is thus related in a late anecdote: \"Gravina's barber, who, like most of his profession, was a great talker, one day informed him, that in the Place de la Valicella, where he had his shop, a young boy came every evening, and sung extempore verses of his own composition, so harmonious and elegant that all the passersby stopped to listen to them. Gravina, upon this information, added one to the number of the young poet's audience, and found the verses so superior to the idea which he had formed of them from the account of the barber, and so much above the capacity of a child of ten or eleven years of age, that he instantly determined to undertake the cultivation of so promising a plant. His first care was to put the young Trapassi (which was the boy's name) to school; but apprehending that the ordinary methods of education might check the progress of so uncommon talent, he took him home to his own house, and changed his name into Metastasio, which signifies the same thing in Greek. In short, by a plan of education and by instructions suited to his genius, Gravina laid the foundation of that reputation which he predicted, and which Metastasio now enjoys.\" Vies des Hommes Illustres d'Italie, tom. i. p. 187.","sp":293,"ep":294},{"h":"METASTASIS","t":"in medicine, a transposition or settlement of some humour or disease in some other part; and sometimes it signifies such an alteration of a disease as is succeeded by a solution.\n\nMETATARSUS (seha beyond, and tarsus; the tarsus), in anatomy, that part of the human skeleton containing the middle of the foot.

See LESBOS and MITYLENE.\n\nIn the Irish Philosophical Transactions for 1789, we have a description of this island by the earl of Charlemont, in which he speaks with raptures of its beauties. \"The mountains, whose rugged tops exhibit a pleasing interposition of rocks and fine groves, have their green sides, for many miles along the coast, covered with olives, whose leafy agreeable verdure is corrected, embellished, and brightened by a lively mixture of bays and laurels aspiring to the height of forest trees, of myrtles and pomegranates, of arbutes rich at once in blossom and in berry, of mulberries growing wild and laden with fruit, &c. Winter is here unknown, the verdure is perpetual, and the frequency of evergreens gives to December the colour of June. The parching heat of summer is never felt; the thick shade of trees, and thousands of crystal springs which everywhere arise and form themselves into unnumbered rivulets, joined to the refreshing sea breeze, the constant corrective and companion of noontide heat, qualify the burning air and render the year a never-ending May. The houses are constructed in such a manner as to have the best view of these natural beauties. Each is a square tower neatly built of hewn stone, so high as to overtop the trees, and to command a view of the sea and neighbouring islands. The lower stories are granaries and storehouses; and the habitable apartments are all at the top, to which you ascend by a stone stair, built for the most part on the outside, and surrounding the tower; so that from the apartment the trees are overlooked, and the whole country is seen; while the habitations themselves, which are very numerous, peering above the groves, add life and variety to the enchanting prospect, and give an air of human population to these woodlands, which might otherwise be supposed the region of Dryads, of Naiads, and of Satyrs.\"\n\nThe most remarkable thing, however, in this island is a custom by which the women have here openly usurped those rights of sovereignty which in other countries\ncountries are supposed to belong essentially to the men.\n\n\"Contrary (says his lordship) to the usage of all other countries, the eldest daughter here inherits; and the sons, like daughters everywhere else, are portioned off with small dowers, or, which is still worse, turned out penniless to seek their fortune. If a man have two daughters, the eldest, at her marriage, is entitled to all her mother's possessions, which are by far the greater part of the family estate, as the mother, keeping up her prerogative, never parts with the power over any portion of what she has brought into the family, until she is forced into it by the marriage of her daughter; and the father also is compelled to ruin himself by adding whatever he may have scraped together by his industry. The second daughter inherits nothing, and is condemned to perpetual celibacy. She is styled a calogria, which signifies properly a religious woman or nun, and is in effect a menial servant to her sister, being employed by her in any office she may think fit to impose, frequently serving her as waitingmaid, as cook, and often in employments still more degrading. She wears a habit peculiar to her situation, which she can never change; a sort of monastic dress, coarse, and of a dark brown. One advantage, however, she enjoys over her sister, that whereas the elder, before marriage, is never allowed to go abroad, or to see any man, her nearest relations only excepted, the calogria, except when employed in domestic toil, is in this respect at perfect liberty. But when the sister is married, the situation of the poor calogria becomes desperate indeed, and is rendered still more humiliating by the comparison between her condition and that of her happy mistress. The married sister enjoys every sort of liberty; the whole family fortune is hers, and she spends it as she pleases; her husband is her obsequious servant, her father and mother are dependent upon her, she dresses in a most magnificent manner, covered all over, according to the fashion of the island, with pearls and with pieces of gold, which are commonly sequins; thus continually carrying about her the enviable marks of affluence and superiority, while the wretched calogria follows her as a servant, arrayed in simple homespun brown, and without the most distant hope of ever changing her condition. Such a disparity may seem intolerable, but what will not custom reconcile? Neither are the misfortunes of the family yet at an end. The father and mother, with what little is left them, contrive by their industry to accumulate a second little fortune; and this, if they should have a third daughter, they are obliged to give to her upon her marriage; and the fourth, if there should be one, becomes her calogria; and so on through all the daughters alternately. Whenever the daughter is marriageable, she can by custom compel the father to procure her a husband; and the mother, such is the power of habit, is foolish enough to join her in tempting him into an immediate compliance, though its consequences must be equally fatal and ruinous to both of them. From hence it happens, that nothing is more common than to see the old father and mother reduced to the utmost indigence, and even begging about the streets, while their unnatural daughters are in affluence; and we ourselves have frequently been shown the eldest daughter parading it through the town in the greatest splendour, while her mother and sister followed her as servants, and made a melancholy part of her attendant train.\n\n\"The sons, as soon as they are of an age to gain a livelihood, are turned out of the family, sometimes with a small present or portion, but more frequently without anything to support them; and thus reduced, they either endeavour to live by their labour, or, which is more usual, go on board some trading vessel as sailors or as servants, remaining abroad till they have got together some competency, and then return home to marry and to be hanged. Some few there are who, taking advantage of the Turkish law, break through this whimsical custom, who marry their calogrias, and retain to themselves a competent provision: but these are accounted men of a singular and even criminal disposition, and are hated and despised as conformists to Turkish manners, and deserters of their native customs; so that we may suppose they are few indeed who have the boldness to depart from the manners of their country, to adopt the customs of their detested masters, and to brave the contempt, the derision, and the hatred, of their neighbours and fellow-citizens.\n\n\"Of all these extraordinary particulars I was informed by the French consul, a man of sense and of indisputable veracity, who had resided in this island for several years, and who solemnly assured me that every circumstance was true: but indeed our own observation left us without the least room for doubt, and the singular appearance and deportment of the ladies fully evinced the truth of our friend's relation. In walking through the town, it is easy to perceive, from the whimsical manners of the female passengers, that the women, according to the vulgar phrase, wear the breeches. They frequently stopped us in the streets, examined our dress, interrogated us with a bold and manly air, laughed at our foreign garb and appearance; and showed so little attention to that decent modesty which is or ought to be the true characteristic of the sex, that there is every reason to suppose they would, in spite of their haughtiness, be the kindest ladies upon earth, if they were not strictly watched by the Turks, who are here very numerous, and would be ready to punish any transgression of their ungallant laws with arbitrary fines. But nature and native manners will often baffle the efforts even of tyranny. In all their customs these manly ladies seem to have changed sexes with the men. The woman rides astride, the man sits sideways upon the horse; nay, I have been assured that the husband's distinguishing appellation is his wife's family name. The women have town and country houses, in the management of which the husband never dares interfere. Their gardens, their servants, are all their own; and the husband, from every circumstance of his behaviour, appears to be no other than his wife's first domestic, perpetually bound to her service, and slave to her caprice. Hence it is that a tradition obtains in the country, that this island was formerly inhabited by Amazons; a tradition, however, founded upon no ancient history that I know of. Sappho indeed, the most renowned female that this island has ever produced, is said to have had manly inclinations; in which, as Lucian informs us, she did but conform with the singular manners of her countrywomen: but I do not find that the mode in which\nthe choice to show these inclinations is imitated by the present female inhabitants, who seem perfectly content with the dear prerogative of absolute sway, without endeavouring in any other particular to change the course of nature; yet will this circumstance serve to show, that the women of Lesbos had always something peculiar, and even peculiarly masculine, in their manners and propensities. But be this as it may, it is certain that no country whatsoever can afford a more perfect idea of an Amazonian commonwealth, or better serve to render probable those ancient relations which our manners would induce us to esteem incredible, than this island of Metelin. These lordly ladies are for the most part very handsome in spite of their dress, which is singular and disadvantageous. Down to the girdle, which as in the old Grecian garb is raised far above what we usually call the waist, they wear nothing but a shift of thin and transparent gauze, red, green, or brown, through which everything is visible, their breasts only excepted, which they cover with a sort of handkerchief; and this, as we were informed, the Turks have obliged them to wear, while they look upon it as an encumbrance, and as no inconsiderable portion of Turkish tyranny. Long sleeves of the same thin material perfectly show their arms even to the shoulder. Their principal ornaments are chains of pearl, to which they hang small pieces of gold coin. Their eyes are large and fine; and the nose, which we term Grecian, usually prevails among them, as it does indeed among the women of all these islands. Their complexions are naturally fine; but they spoil them by paint, of which they make abundant use; and they disfigure their pretty faces by shaving the hinder part of the eyebrow, and replacing it with a straight line of hair neatly applied with some sort of gum, the brow being thus continued in a straight and narrow line till it joins the hair on each side of their face. They are well made, of the middle size, and for the most part plump; but they are distinguished by nothing so much and so universally as by a haughty, disdainful, and supercilious air, with which they seem to look down upon all mankind as creatures of an inferior nature, born for their service, and doomed to be their slaves; neither does this peculiarity of countenance in any degree diminish their natural beauty, but rather adds to it that sort of bewitching attraction which the French call piquant.\"\n\nHis lordship has been at great pains to investigate the origin of such a singular custom; but is unable to find any other example in history than that of the Lycians, who called themselves by the names of their mothers, and not of their fathers. When asked by their neighbours who they were? they described themselves by their maternal genealogy. If a gentleman should marry a slave, the children by that marriage were accounted noble; but though the first man among them marry a foreign woman, the children would be accounted ignoble. This custom is mentioned by several ancient authors. A difficulty of no little magnitude occurs, however, in accounting for the derivation of the inhabitants of Lesbos from the Lycians. This is solved in the following manner: In times of the most remote antiquity, the island of Lesbos was peopled by the Pelasgi, who, under their leader Xanthus, the son of Triopas king of Argos, first inhabited Lesbos; previous to that time they had dwelt in a certain part of Metellus Lycia which they had conquered; and in this country we may suppose they had learned the custom in question.","sp":294,"ep":296},{"h":"METELLUS","t":"the surname of the family of the Caecilii at Rome, the most known of whom were \u2014A general who defeated the Achaeans, took Thebes, and invaded Macedonia, &c.\u2014Q.

If they had been vicious, they were imprisoned in the bodies of miserable beasts, there to do penance for several ages: at the expiration whereof, they returned refreshed to animate men. But, if they lived virtuously, some happier brute, or even a human creature, was to be their lot.\n\nWhat led Pythagoras into this opinion was, the persuasion\nMetempsychosis he had that the soul was not of a perishable nature; whence he concluded that it must remove into some other body upon its abandoning this. Lucan treats this doctrine as a kind of officious lie, contrived to mitigate the apprehension of death, by persuading men that they only changed their lodging, and only ceased to live to begin a new life.\n\nReuchlin denies this doctrine; and maintains that the metempsychosis of Pythagoras implied nothing more than a similitude of manners, desires, and studies, formerly existing in some person deceased, and now revived in another alive. Thus when it was said that Euphorbus was revived in Pythagoras, no more was meant than that the martial virtue which had shone in Euphorbus at the time of the Trojan war, was now, in some measure, revived in Pythagoras, by reason of the great respect he bore the athlete. For those people wondering how a philosopher should be so much taken with men of the sword, he palliated the matter, by saying, that the soul of Euphorbus, i.e., his genius, disposition, and inclinations, were revived in him. And this gave occasion to the report, that Euphorbus's soul, who perished in the Trojan war, had transmigrated into Pythagoras.\n\nFicinus affirms, that what Plato speaks of the migration of a human soul into a brute, is intended allegorically, and is to be understood only of the manners, affections, and habits, degenerated into a beastly nature by vice. Serranus, though he allows some force to this interpretation, yet inclines rather to understand the metempsychosis of a resurrection.\n\nPythagoras is said to have borrowed the notion of a metempsychosis from the Egyptians; others say, from the ancient Brahmins. It is still retained among the Banians and other idolaters of India and China; and makes the principal foundation of their religion. So extremely are they bigotted to it, that they not only forbear eating any thing that has life, but many of them even refuse to defend themselves from wild beasts. They burn no wood, lest some little animalcule should be in it; and are so very charitable, that they will redeem from the hands of strangers any animals that they find ready to be killed. See Pythagoreans.\n\n**METEMPSYCHOSIS** (from \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03b8\u03b7, and \u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1 \u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 \"I fail,\") a term in chronology, expressing the solar equation, necessary to prevent the new moon from happening a day too late. By which it stands contradistinguished from proempsyphos, which signifies the lunar equation, necessary to prevent the new moon from happening a day too soon.\n\nThe new moons running a little backwards, that is, coming a day too soon at the end of 312 years and a half; by the proempsyphos, a day is added every 300 years, and another every 2400 years: on the other hand, by the metempsyphos, a bifextile is suppressed each 134 years; that is, three times in 400 years. These alterations are never made but at the end of each century; that period being very remarkable, and rendering the practice of the calendar easy.\n\nThere are three rules for making this addition or suppression of the bifextile day, and, by consequence, for changing the index of the epacts. 1. When there is a metempsyphos without a proempsyphos, the next following, or lower index, must be taken. 2. When there is a proempsyphos without a metempsyphos, the next preceding or superior index is to be taken. 3. When there are both a metempsyphos and a proempsyphos, or when there is neither the one nor the other, the same index is preserved. Thus, in 1600, we had D: in 1700, by reason of the metempsyphos, C was taken: in 1800, there was both a proempsyphos and a metempsyphos; so the same index was retained. In 1900, there will be a metempsyphos again, when B will be taken; which will be preserved in 2000, because there will then be neither the one nor the other. This is as far as we need compute for it: But Clavius has calculated a cycle of 301,800 years; at the end of which period, the same indices return in the same order.\n\nSee **EPACT**.","sp":296,"ep":297},{"h":"METEOR","t":"(by the Greeks called \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03c9\u03be\u03b1, q.d. sublima or \"high raised;\" by the Latins impressiones as making signs or impressions in the air), commonly denotes any bodies in the air that are of a transitory nature. Hence it is extended to the phenomena of hail, rain, snow, thunder, &c.; but is most commonly confined to those unusual and fiery appearances named falling stars, ignes fulvi, aurora borealis, &c. See **METEOROLOGY**.\n\n**METEOROLITE.** This term is derived from the Greek \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03c9\u03be\u03b1, a meteor, and \u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2, a stone; and denotes a stony substance, exhibiting peculiar characters, and whose descent to the earth is usually accompanied by the appearance and explosion of a fire-ball.\n\nLuminous meteors have, in all ages, been observed in the atmosphere. It is also well known that their disappearance has frequently been attended with a loud noise; but that they should moreover terminate in the fall of one or more solid bodies to the earth's surface, is a position so repugnant to our ordinary conceptions of the tenor of physical events, that we cannot admit it as a fact on slight or scanty evidence. With due deference, however, to some philosophers of name, we are not prepared to assert, that it implies impossibility. For who has explored the higher regions of the atmosphere? or who knows what may take place beyond its precincts? If a solid result from the combination of two aeriform substances, as muriatic acid and ammonical gases; if oxygen, the properties of which are most familiar to us in the state of gas, can undergo fixation, and if fluids can pass into crystalline forms, is it too bold to presume, that the same, or similar processes, effected in the grand laboratory of the atmosphere, may be within the range of possible occurrences? At all events, the same Being who called into existence those sublime and countless masses of matter which revolve in space, may, to serve purposes unknown to us, create bodies of dimensions infinitely smaller, and destined to impinge on some planetary orb. The reasoning of an angel may not convince us, that a part is greater than the whole, or that the value of two and two is equivalent to five; but a very ordinary logician may prove to our satisfaction, that the contact of particles of matter in portions of space which lie beyond our globe, is no chimerical supposition. Every thing around us proclaims, that matter is subject to incessant change. New forms and new modifications are ever springing into being: and can we doubt, that the same particles, as they may happen to be affected or influenced by various circumstances, may exist in the state of gas, of aqueous vapour, or of a concrete mass?\n\nAgain,\nAgain, it surely will not be seriously maintained, that, from the rarity of a phenomenon, we are warranted to infer its nonexistence. The appearance of a comet is rare, but not a fictitious occurrence. Nay, we may safely advance a step farther, and assert, without fear of confutation, that the existence of a phenomenon, if otherwise well attested, cannot be disproved by our inability to explain it. How multiplied, in fact, are the subjects, even of our daily and hourly observation, which we cannot satisfactorily expound? We cannot say why a small seed should gradually unfold into a large tree, why flame should produce heat, why the hand should act in immediate subserviency to the will, or why a contusion of the brain should induce stupor, alienation of mind, or death. It is one thing to prove a fact, and it is another to account for it.\n\nFrom these premises it follows in course, that we are not entitled to reject the existence of meteoric stones, provided it be established by valid testimony. Should the historical evidence, on a fair and disinterested review, be deemed conclusive, we may afterwards examine the theories which have been propounded for the solution of the appearance.\n\nFrom the Scriptures of the Old Testament we are not aware that any passage can be cited in direct corroboration of the descent of stones from the atmosphere. The ingenious and fanciful Mr Edward King, indeed, in his \"Remarks concerning stones said to have fallen from the clouds, both in these days, and in ancient times,\" adverts to the 11th verse of the 18th Psalm.\u2014The Lord also thundered out of heaven, and the Highest gave his thunder: hail-stones and coals of fire.\" This last expression has, no doubt, been conjectured to denote real hard bodies, in a state of ignition; and the term \u1f00\u03b2\u03bf\u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2, employed by the cautious Seventy, rather favours such an interpretation. The same expression, however, occurs in the preceding verse, without admitting this interpretation; and the phrase seems to be only a figurative mode of describing lightning. In the sober latitudes of the north, and even in colloquial language, we talk of balls of fire and thunderbolts, without any reference to solid matter. Mr King likewise quotes the 11th verse of the 10th chapter of Joshua.\u2014\"And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Beth-horon, that the Lord cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hail-stones, than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.\" Here, the expression, great stones, is less equivocal than coals of fire; yet the context hardly allows us to doubt, that the great stones were really hail-stones, or rather, perhaps, lumps of ice, consolidated in the atmosphere, such as occasionally fall in hot countries, and such as alarmed the whole of Paris and its neighbourhood in 1788. At any rate, the slaughter of the Canaanites is represented as resulting from the special interposition of divine power; and the consideration of miracles is irrelevant to our present purpose.\n\nIf from sacred, we turn to the early period of profane history, we shall find the annals of public events very copiously interspersed with notices of strange appearances, many of which may be safely ascribed to the ascendancy which superstition long obtained over the human mind. The skepticism of the learned is, however, sometimes not less injudicious and indiscriminate than the credulity of the savage; and he who should resolve every extraordinary event, which is recorded by the writers of Greece and Rome, into a \"cunningly devised fable,\" would not be less reprehensible for want of candour, than the untutored rustic, who yields his assent to every alleged miracle, is to be taxed with want of discernment.\n\nAlthough these general positions can scarcely admit of dispute, it becomes extremely difficult, after a lapse of many ages, and in the collation of marvellous records, to separate truth from falsehood. In our attempts to prosecute this analytical process, we may sometimes advance a certain length with perfect security, without being able to trace uniformly the precise lines of demarcation. Thus, in regard to the topic of our present discussion, we know, that in various periods of the world the vulgar have ascribed a celestial origin to stones of a peculiar configuration, as to certain modifications of pyrites, to belemnites, orthoceratites, &c., which the subsequent observations of naturalists have proved to be of mineral formation, and to the heads of arrows and sharpened flints, which have been fashioned by the hand of man, and which, accordingly, we are authorized to exclude from the extra-terrestrial catalogue. But when substances dissimilar from these, and coinciding in any one character or circumstance with modern specimens of atmospheric stone, are reported by the ancients to have fallen from the clouds, the distance of ages and the lameness of the documents may powerfully affect our appreciation of the reputed evidence.\n\nWhen, therefore, we shortly touch on a few of the many instances which might be quoted from the annals of antiquity, we mean not to vouch for the truth even of these particular instances; but merely to admit their probability, and the weight which the mention of them may be considered to add to that of subsequent and recent narrations.\n\nThrough the mist of fable which envelopes the history of the b\u00e6tuli, we discern some characters which correspond with those of meteorites. Thus, in the \u039b\u03cd\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, a poem falsely ascribed to Orpheus, the \u03b5\u1f30\u03b4\u03c9\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2, which M. Falconet properly classes with the b\u00e6tuli, is said to be rough, heavy, and black. Damascius, in an extract of his life of Ibdorus, preserved by Photius, relates that the b\u00e6tuli fell on Mount Libanus, in a globe of fire. A fragment of Sanchoniathon, preserved in Eusebius, (Pr\u00e6par. Evangel. i. 10.), moreover informs us, that these stones were fabricated by the god Uranus (or Heaven), one of whose four sons was named B\u00e6tulus. May not this mythological genealogy be regarded as merely emblematical of their descent from the upper regions of the atmosphere? In the same chapter we are told that Attarne found a star which had fallen from heaven, and honoured it with consecration in the city of Tyre. The stone denominated \"the mother of the gods,\" if we can believe Appian, Herodian, and Marcellinus, fell from heaven. Aristodemus, cited by the Greek scholiast on Pindar, affirms that it fell encircled by fire, on a hill, at the feet of the Theban bard. It is said to have been of a black colour, and of an irregular shape. Herodian (lib. v.) expressly declares, that the Phoenicians had no statue of the sun, polished by the hand; but only a certain stone, circular below, and terminated.\nterminated acutely above, in the form of a cone, of a black colour, and that, according to report, it fell from heaven, and was regarded as the image of the sun.\n\nAmong various instances which might be selected from Livy, is that of a shower of stones on Mount Alba, in the reign of Tullus Hostilius, or about six hundred and fifty-two years before the birth of Christ. When the senate were told, that it had rained stones, they doubted the fact, and deputed commissioners to inquire into the particulars. They were then assured, that stones had really fallen, haud alter quam quem grandinem venti glomeratam in terras agunt. On this occasion, the historian mentions, that similar events were celebrated by a festival of nine days. Manjit follemne, ut quando cumque idem prodigium nuntiarent, feriae per novem dies agerentur.\n\nBut one of the most remarkable cases which occurs in the records of antiquity, is that which is mentioned in the 58th chapter of the second book of Pliny's Natural History, of a large stone which fell near Egepolotamos, in Thrace, in the second year of the seventy-eighth Olympiad, or, according to our chronology, about four hundred and sixty-seven years before the Christian era. Pliny affirms us, that this extraordinary mass was still shewn in his day; and that it was as large as a cart, and of a burnt colour. The Greeks pretended that it had fallen from the sun, and that Anaxagoras had predicted the day of its arrival on the earth's surface. According to Plutarch, in the life of Lycurgus, the inhabitants of the Chersonesus held the Thracian stone in great veneration, and exhibited it as a public show. His account of its first appearance is chiefly extracted from the relation of Daimachus of Platea, and may be thus translated. \"During seventy-five successive days before the stone fell, a large fiery body, like a cloud of flame, was observed in the heavens, not fixed to one point, but wandering about with a broken, irregular motion. By its violent agitation, several fiery fragments were forced from it, impelled in various directions, and darted with the velocity and brightness of so many shooting stars. After this body had fallen on the Chersonesus, and the people had assembled to examine it, they could find no inflammable matter, nor the slightest trace of combustion, but a real stone, which, though large, by no means corresponded to the dimensions of the flaming globe which they had seen in the sky, but seemed to be only a piece detached from it.\" Daimachus, it is true, may, on this occasion, have given way to his reputed love of the marvellous; and we can easily believe that the seventy-five continuous days are either an error of the copyist, or an original exaggeration; yet, from the marked coincidence of some of the circumstances with those more fully detailed in the sequel, there arises the presumption that a meteorite really fell at the place and period above assigned.\n\nFrom this period, till near the close of the fifteenth century, any historical notices which we have been enabled to collect, are so vague and scanty, that, in this abridged view of the subject, we may pass them over in silence.\n\nProfessor Bantenschoen, of the central school of Colmar, first directed the attention of naturalists to some of the old chronicles, which commemorate with much na\u00efvet\u00e9, and in the true spirit of the times, the fall of the celebrated stone of Ensisheim. The following account accompanied this very singular mass, when it was suspended in the church.\n\n\"In the year of the Lord 1492, on Wednesday, which was Martinmas eve, the 7th of November, there happened a singular miracle: for, between eleven o'clock and noon, there was a loud peal of thunder, and a prolonged confused noise, which was heard to a great distance, and a stone fell from the air, in the jurisdiction of Ensisheim, which weighed 260 pounds, and the confused noise was, moreover, much louder than here. There a child saw it strike on a field, situated in the upper jurisdiction, towards the Rhine and Inn, near the district of Giffard, which was sown with wheat, and did it no harm, except that it made a hole there; and then they conveyed it from that spot; and many pieces were broken from it, which the landvogt forbade. They, therefore, caused it to be placed in the church, with the intention of suspending it as a miracle; and many people came hither to see this stone. So there were remarkable conversations about this stone; but the learned said, that they knew not what it was; for it was beyond the ordinary course of nature, that such a large mass should unite the earth from the height of the air; but that it was really a miracle of God; for, before that time, never anything was heard like it, nor seen, nor described. When the people found that stone, it had entered into the earth, to the depth of a man's stature, which every body explained to be the will of God, that it should be found, and the noise of it was heard at Lucerne, at Villing, and in many other places, so loud, that it was believed that houses had been overturned: And as the king (Maximilian) was here, the Monday after St Catherine's day, of the same year, his royal excellence ordered the stone which had fallen to be brought to the castle, and after having conferred a long time about it with the noblemen, he said the people of Ensisheim should take it, and order it to be hung up in the church, and not allow any body to take anything from it. However, his excellency took two pieces of it, of which he kept one, and sent the other to the duke Sigismund of Austria; and they spoke a great deal about this stone, which they suspended in the choir, where it still is; and a great many people came to see it.\"\n\nTrithemius, in his Hirsauigenian Annals, employs language to this effect.\u2014\"In the same year, on the 7th day of November, in the village of Suntgaw, near the townlet of Ensisheim, not far from Basle, a city of Germany, a stone, called a thunder-stone, of a prodigious size, for we know from eye-witnesses that it weighed 255 pounds, fell from the heavens. Its fall was so violent, that it broke into two pieces. The most considerable is still exhibited at the door of the church of Ensisheim, suspended by an iron chain, as a proof of the fact which we have mentioned, and to preserve it in the public recollection.\"\u2014We learn also from Paul Lang that there arose a furious storm on the 7th of November 1492, and that while the thunder roared, and the heavens appeared all on fire, a stone of enormous size fell near Ensisheim. \"Its form was that of the Greek delta, with a triangular point. They still show it at Ensisheim as an astonishing phenomenon.\"\n\nIt is worthy of observation, that these chroniclers lived at the period which they assign to the descent of\nthe stone; and that, though their names are hastening to oblivion, Tritheimius yielded to few of his contemporaries in labour and learning; while Lang, a German Benedictine as he was, travelled in search of historical monuments, arraigned the licence of the catholic clergy, and applauded the independence of Luther and Melanchthon.\n\nOf the Ensisheim stone, which has been transported to the national library at Colmar, and which, notwithstanding various dilapidations, still weighs 150 pounds, some interesting specimens may now be seen in the cabinets of the curious. Robert Ferguson, Esq., younger of Raith, has, in the most polite and obliging manner, gratified us with the sight of a small fragment, which belongs to his valuable collection of minerals at Raith house in Fifehire, Scotland.\n\nWe are fully aware, that M. Barthold has laboured to convince his readers (Journal de Physique, Ventofe, year 8.) that the far-famed mass of Ensisheim is merely argillo-ferruginous, of secondary formation, detached from an adjacent mountain, and conveyed to the spot on which it was found by some torrent or land-flood. In this opinion, we might partially acquiesce; did not the artificers of contemporary and concurring records militate against it, and had not the more accurate analysis of Vauquelin detected the same constituent parts as in the other stony and metallic substances denominated meteoric. \"It is certainly composed of silica,\" observes this celebrated chemist, \"of magnesia, of iron, of nickel, of sulphur, and of a small quantity of lime.\u2014Particular trials have convinced me of the presence of sulphur and nickel in the grains of malleable iron, and in the pyrites, though in different proportions. This stone, then, in every respect, resembles others which have fallen from the atmosphere.\"\n\nIn the Commentary of Surius, a Carthusian monk of Cologne, mention is made of a shower of large stones in Lombardy, in 1510. These stones were harder than flint, and smelled of sulphur. The heaviest weighed 120 pounds.\u2014The same event is more particularly related by Cardan, in his work intitled de Rerum Varietate (lib. xiv. c. 72.) According to this author, near the river Adda, not far from Milan, and at five o'clock in the evening, about 1120 stones fell from the air, one of them weighing 120 pounds and another 60 pounds. Many were presented to the French governor, and his deputy. At three o'clock P.M. the sky appeared as if in a general blaze; and the passage, though somewhat ambiguous, would lead us to infer, that the meteor was visible for two hours. Like many of the learned and unlearned of his day, Cardan instantly connects the extraordinary appearance with the political transactions of his district.\n\nWe next pass to an interesting extract from the memoirs of the emperor Jehangire, written in Persian, by himself, and translated by Colonel Kirkpatrick,\n\n\"A.H. 1030, or 16th year of the reign.\u2014The following is among the extraordinary occurrences of this period.\n\n\"Early on the 30th of Furverdeen of the present year (1629), and in the eastern quarter of the heavens, there arose in one of the villages of the purgannah of Jalindher, such a great and tremendous noise, as had nearly, by its dreadful nature, deprived the inhabitants of the place of their senses. During this noise, a luminous body was observed to fall from above, on the earth, suggesting to the beholders the idea that the firmament was raining fire. In a short time, the noise having subsided, and the inhabitants having recovered from their alarm, a courier was dispatched to Mahomed Syeed, the amil of the aforefaid purgannah, to advertise him of this event. The amil, instantly mounting his horse, proceeded to the spot. Here he perceived the earth, to the extent of a dozen yards in length and breadth, to be burned to such a degree, that not the least trace of verdure, or a blade of grass remained; nor had the heat yet subsided entirely.\n\n\"Mahammed Syeed hereupon directed the aforefaid space of ground to be dug up; when the deeper it was dug, the greater was the heat of it found to be. At length a lump of iron made its appearance, the heat of which was so violent, that one might have supposed it to have been taken from a furnace. After some time it became cold: when the amil conveyed it to his own habitation, from whence he afterwards dispatched it in a sealed bag to court.\n\n\"Here I had this substance weighed in my presence. Its weight was 160 tolahs (A). I committed it to a skilful artisan, with orders to make of it a sabre, a knife, and a dagger. The workman reported, that the substance was not malleable, but shattered into pieces under the hammer.\n\n\"Upon this I ordered it to be mixed with other iron. Conformably to my orders, three parts of the iron of lightning (B) were mixed with one part of common iron; and from the mixture were made two sabres, one knife, and one dagger.\"\n\nOur limits will not permit us to give the whole of the extract, nor the remarks of the Right Hon. Charles Greville and Colonel Kirkpatrick, which were read before the Royal Society of London, on the 27th January, 1803. We feel, however, no hesitation in attaching to this document something very nearly approaching to direct evidence of the fact in question.\n\nThe celebrated Gassendi relates, that, on the 27th of November, 1627, about 10 o'clock A.M., during a very clear sky, he saw a flaming stone, of the apparent diameter of four feet, fall on Mount Vaison, an eminence situated between the small towns of Perne and Guillaumes, in Provence. This stone was surrounded by a luminous circle of different colours, nearly resembling the rainbow, and its fall was accompanied with a noise like the discharge of artillery. It weighed 59 pounds; and its specific gravity was to that of common marble as 14 to 11. It was of a dark metallic colour, and extremely hard. Though it was not subjected to chemical analysis, and is not now to be found, the circumstances which have been stated by the philosopher are sufficiently\n\n(A) A tolah is about 180 grains, Troy weight.\n(B) This expression is equivalent to our term thunder-bolt.\nsufficiently minute to operate on the conviction of those who are willing to be convinced.\n\nFrom a curious book printed at Paris in 1672, and now become very scarce, entitled Conversations tir\u00e9es de l'Acad\u00e9mie de M. l'Abb\u00e9 Bourdelot, contenant diverses recherches et observations physiques, par le Sieur Legallais, we make the ensuing extract.\n\n\"A member presents a fragment of two stones which fell near Verona, one of which weighed 300, and the other 200 pounds. These stones,\" says he, \"fell during the night, when the weather was perfectly mild and serene. They seemed to be all on fire, and came from above, but in a slanting direction, and with a tremendous noise. This prodigy terribly alarmed 300 or 400 eyewitnesses, who were at a loss what to think of it. These stones fell with such rapidity, that they formed a ditch, in which after the noise had ceased, the spectators ventured to approach them, and examine them more closely. They then sent them to Verona, where they were deposited in the Academy, and that learned body sent fragments of them to different places.\"\n\nThat which accompanied the above intimation was of a yellowish hue, very easily pulverized, and smelled of sulphur.\u2014In the course of examining one of these stones, M. Laugier, professor of pharmacy at Paris, has recently detected the presence of chrome, by means of the caustic alkali.\u2014The date of the Verona phenomena, if we have been correctly informed, is 1663.\n\nIn the Bornian collection there is a substance which is designated Ferrum retractorium, granulis nitentibus, matrice virescenti immixtis (Ferrum vires Lin.), cujus fragmenta ab unius ad viginti usque librarum pondus, cortice nigro scoriaco circumdata, ad Plann, prope Tabor, circuli Bechinchens Bohemiae, palum reperturunt.\n\nThe following note is subjoined. (Quae fragmenta 3. Iulii anni 1753, inter tonitrura, e celo pluteo creduliores quidam affluerunt.) The expression creduliores quidam, it may be alleged, at once destroys the evidence of this memorandum. It deserves, however, to be noted, that, in regard to our present subject, what was formerly accounted the credulity of the vulgar, may now, on several occasions, be confirmed into probability, if not into matter of fact; and that Mr Greville has found the identical fragment to have the same composition with other meteoric stones. Hence, we are compelled either to admit its extra-terrestrial origin, or the existence of a substance, originally belonging to the earth, and yet agreeing in character with those deemed atmospheric. The former part of the alternative is perfectly consonant with well-authenticated facts; whereas of the latter, we are not warranted to pronounce, that a single case has hitherto been established, to the satisfaction of any chemist or mineralogist.\n\nBut we have now to turn our attention to a report of M. de la Lande, inserted in the Historical Almanack of Breffle, for 1756.\n\nIn the month of September, 1753, about one o'clock P.M. when the weather was very hot, and very serene, without the least appearance of a cloud, a very loud noise, like the discharge of two or three cannons, was heard within the circumference of six leagues, but was of very short duration. This noise was loudest in the neighbourhood of Pont-de-Velle; and at Liponas, a village three leagues from the last-mentioned place, it was even accompanied with a hissing, like that of a cracker. On the same evening there were found at Liponas and at Pin, two blackish masses, of a form nearly circular, but very uneven, which had fallen on ploughed ground, and sunk, by their own weight, to half a foot below the surface. One of them weighed about twenty pounds; and a fragment of one of them weighing 114 lb. was preferred in the cabinet of M. Varenne de Beoff, at Dijon. The basis of these masses resembled a grayish whinstone, and was very refractory; and some ferruginous particles were disseminated in grains, filaments, or minute masses, through the substance of the stone, especially in its fissures. This iron, when subjected to a red heat, became obedient to the magnet. The black coating on the surface, M. de la Lande attributes to fusion, induced by violent heat. This gentleman's acknowledged respectability and accuracy of observation, combined with the circumstances which he has adduced, circumstances, too, which, if mistated, lay so open to public investigation, powerfully plead in favour of his testimony.\n\nOn the 15th of September 1760, according to the abb\u00e9 Bachelay, about half past four o'clock P.M. there appeared near the chateau de Chevabrie, in the neighbourhood of Luc\u00e9, a small town of the province of Maine, a stormy cloud, from which proceeded a loud peal of thunder, like the discharge of cannon, and followed by a noise which was mistaken by several people for the lowing of oxen. This sound was heard over a space of about two leagues and a half, but unaccompanied by any perceptible flame. The reapers in the parish of Perigu\u00e9, about three leagues from Luc\u00e9, on hearing the same noise, looked up, and saw an opaque body, which described a curve, and fell on soft turf, on the high road from Mons, near which they were at work. They all quickly ran up to it, and found a sort of stone, nearly half of which was buried in the earth, and the whole so hot that it could not be touched. At first they ran away in a panic; but on returning to the spot some time after, they found the stone precisely in the same situation, and sufficiently cooled to admit of being handled, and narrowly examined. It weighed seven ounces and a half, and was of a triangular form, presenting, as it were, three rounded horns, one of which, at the moment of the fall had entered into the ground, and was of a gray or ash colour, while the rest, which was exposed to the air, was very black. When the abb\u00e9 presented this stone to the academy, that body appointed three of its number, namely, Messieurs Lavoisier, Fougeroux, and Cadet, to examine and analyse it. This task they performed with more care and accuracy than M. de la Lande had done on the preceding occasion; but their trial was confined to an integral part of the whole, considered as a homogeneous substance, in place of being repeated on each of the constituent parts. The substance was of a pale cinereous hue, speckled with an infinite number of small and shining metallic points, visible through a magnifying glass. That part of the outer surface which remained above ground was incrusted with a thin black coating, which seemed to have undergone fusion, and which gave a few sparks when struck with steel. The specific gravity of the mass was 3.335.\n\n\u2014Two other stones, nearly of the same characters, the one reported to have fallen at Ajre, in Artois, and\nthe other in the Cotentin, in Normandy, were presented to the academy in the course of the same year by M. Gurlon de Boyaval, honorary lieutenant-general of the bailiwick of Aire, and the younger M. Morand. According to the academical report, these three stones, when compared, presented no difference to the eye, were of the same colour, and nearly of the same grain, exhibiting metallic and pyritous particles, and covered with a black and ferruginous incrustation. Although the coincidence of facts and circumstances, in three places so remote from one another, did not convince the academy that these stones had been conveyed to the earth by lightning, yet it induced them to invite naturalists to prosecute the examination of the subject.\n\nOn the 20th of November 1768, a stone fell at Mauerkirchen near the Inn, in Bavaria, that weighed 38lb. was of a triangular form, and only eight inches in thickness. Its fall was accompanied by a hissing noise, and great darkness in the atmosphere. This meteorite penetrated two feet and a half into the soil. Part of it is now in the museum of the right honourable Charles Greville, and a fragment may be seen in Mr Ferguson's collection quoted above.\n\nThe next remarkable case on record occurred on the 20th of August 1789, at Barbaton, near Roquefort, in the Landes of Bordeaux, and is thus related by Citizen Lomet, who was known to several members of the institute, and happened to be at Agen when the meteor appeared.\n\n\"It was a very bright fire-ball, luminous as the sun, of the size of an ordinary balloon, and, after inspiring the inhabitants with consternation, burst and disappeared. A few days after, some peasants brought stones, which they said fell from the meteor; but the philosophers to whom they offered them laughed at their assertions as fabulous. The peasants would have now more reason to laugh at the philosophers.\"\u2014One of these stones broke through the roof of a cottage, and killed a herdman and some cattle. Vaquelin, who received a process-verbal of the circumstances, also examined one of the specimens. The fragment procured by Mr Ferguson has visibly all the characters of a genuine meteorite.\n\nA much more remarkable phenomenon, however, of the same description, occurred near Agen, on the 24th of July 1790. An inhabitant of St Severe communicates the following particulars to M. Darcey the chemist, who was then resident at Paris.\n\n\"Our towns-people were yesterday very much alarmed. About a quarter past nine o'clock, in the evening, there suddenly appeared in the air a fire-ball, dragging a long train, which diffused a very vivid light over the horizon. This meteor soon disappeared, and seemed to fall at one hundred paces from us. It was quickly followed by an explosion louder than that of cannon or of thunder. Every body dreaded being buried under the ruins of his house, which seemed to give way from the concussion. The same phenomenon was seen, and the report heard, in the neighbouring towns, as Mont de Marfan, Tartas, and Dax. The weather in other respects was very calm, without a breath of wind or a cloud, and the moon shone in all her brightness.\"\n\nM. Darcey's brother, a clergyman in that part of the country, sent him a small stone, which was picked up on the morning after the explosion, and the history of which he was scrupulously anxious to investigate. Being satisfied with respect to all the particulars, he at length dispatched it to Paris, accompanied with some curious remarks. \"When these stones fell,\" says he, \"they had not their present degree of hardness. Some of them fell on straw, bits of which stuck to the stones, and incorporated with them. I have seen one in this predicament. It is at present at la Battele; but I cannot persuade the owner to part with it.\" Thole which fell on the houses produced a noise, not like that of stones, but rather of a substance which had not yet acquired compactness.\"\n\nWe subjoin the process-verbal\u2014a simple but authentic document.\n\n\"In the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety, and the 30th day of the month of August, we, the Sieur Jean Duby, mayor, and Louis Maulion, procurator of the commune of the municipality of La Grange de Juillac, and Jean Darmite, resident in the parish of La Grange de Juillac, certify in truth and verity, that, on Saturday the 24th of July last, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, there passed a great fire, and after it we heard in the air a very loud and extraordinary noise; and, about two minutes after, there fell stones from heaven, but fortunately there fell only a very few, and they fell about ten paces from one another in some places, and in others nearer, and finally, in some other places, farther, and falling, most of them, of the weight of about half a quarter of a pound each; some of about half a pound, like that found in our parish of La Grange; and on the borders of the parish of Creon, they were found of a pound weight; and in falling they seemed not to be inflamed, but very hard and black without, and within of the colour of steel; and, thank God, they occasioned no harm to the people, nor the trees, but only to some trees which were broken on the houses; and most of them fell gently, and others fell quickly, with a hissing noise; and some were found which had entered into the earth, but very few. In witness whereof we have written and signed these presents.\n\n(Signed) Duby, Mayor\u2014Darmite.\"\n\nMonseigneur Baudin mentions, that, as M. Carris of Barbotan and he were walking in the court of the castle of Mormes about half past nine o'clock, in the evening of the 24th of July 1790, when the air was perfectly calm, and the sky cloudless, they found themselves suddenly surrounded by a pale clear light, which obscured that of the moon, though the latter was nearly full. On looking up, they observed, almost in their zenith, a fireball of a larger apparent diameter than that of the moon, dragging a tail, which seemed to be five or six times longer than the diameter of its body, and which gradually tapered to a point, the latter approaching to blood-red, though the rest of the meteor was of a pale white. This luminous body proceeded with great velocity from south to north, and in two seconds split into portions of considerable size, like the fragment of a bursting bomb. These fragments became extinguished in the air, and some of them, as they fell, assumed that deep red colour, which had been observed at the point of the tail. Two or three minutes after M. Baudin and his friend heard a dreadful explosion, like the simultaneous firing of several pieces of ordnance; but they were not sensible of any tremulous motion under their feet, though the concus-\nMeteorite.\n\nThe phenomenon of the atmosphere shook the windows in their frames, and threw down kitchen utensils from their shelves. When these gentlemen removed to the garden, the noise still continued, and seemed to be directly over their heads. Some time after it had ceased, they heard a hollow sound rolling in echoes, for fifty miles, along the chain of the Pyrenees, and at the end of about four minutes gradually dying away in distance. At the same time, a strong sulphurous odour was diffused in the atmosphere. The interval which occurred between the disruption of the meteor, and the loud report, induced M. Baudin to conjecture, that this fireball must have been at least eight miles from the earth's surface, and that it fell about four miles from Mormes. \"The latter part of my conjecture, lays he, was soon confirmed by an account which we received of a great many stones having fallen from the atmosphere at Juillac and in the neighbourhood of Barbotan.\" It appears, indeed, from the concurring testimony of intelligent persons worthy of credit, that the meteor really exploded at a little distance from Juillac, and that its fragments were found lying in an almost circular space, of nearly two miles in diameter. Some of them weighed eighteen or twenty, and a few, it is alleged, even fifty pounds. M. de Carris procured one of 18 lbs. which he transmitted to the Parisian Academy of Sciences. That examined by M. Baudin was small, but heavy in proportion to its size, black on the outside, grayish within, and intermixed with many minute, thinning, metallic particles. These last circumstances perfectly accord with the fragment of a Barbotan stone preserved in Mr Ferguson's collection.\n\nIn one of his letters to Professor St Amand, M. Goyon d'Arzaz remarks, that these stones, though generally smooth on the outside, presented some longitudinal cracks, or fissures, while their interior parts exhibited symptoms of metallic veins, especially of a ferruginous-complexion. When yet red-hot, and scattered in various directions, they formed that magnificent firework, that shower of flame, which enlightened the horizon over a large tract of country; for this extraordinary meteor was seen at Bayonne, Auch, Pau, Tarbes, and even at Bordeaux and Toulouse. At the last mentioned place it excited little attention, on account of its great distance, and its appearing only a little brighter than a shooting star. It, moreover, deserves to be noted, that the meteorites in question were found on a bare moor, of an extremely thin soil, on which no such stones, or indeed stones of any description, had been observed in the memory of man. They who are solicitous of additional information on this part of our subject, may consult Nos. 23 and 24 of the Journal des Sciences Utiles of Montpellier, for 1790, and the Decade Philosophique for February 1796.\n\nWhen all the circumstances of the case are duly considered, we need not be surprised, that they should produce conviction on the minds of many men of science, who, till then, persisted \"an evil heart of unbelief.\" M. de St Amand ingenuously confessed to M. Pi\u00e9let of Geneva, that he had treated this novel topic with unmerited contempt, and that the evidence deduced from the similar characters of the stones should not be rashly rejected. The learned and the unlearned of the district in which the phenomenon is stated to have occurred, attest its existence; the professor of natural history in the central school of Agen renounces his former scepticism; Vauquelin analyses a specimen, and finds it to contain the same chemical substances as other meteorites, and in nearly the same proportions; and shall we be so unreasonable as to withhold our assent, merely because we have not ocular demonstration of the alleged particulars?\n\nOur chronological series of cases has now brought us to the fall of several meteorites near Sienna, the particulars of which, as reported by the late earl of Bristol and Sir William Hamilton, are recorded in the first part of the Philosophical Transactions for 1795 (page 103). Mr King, likewise in the tract which we have already quoted, communicates some interesting circumstances relative to this phenomenon, chiefly extracted from an account of it published by Professor Soldani. While we refer our readers to these details, we cannot omit mentioning that, in regard to aspect and composition, the Sienna stones are perfectly analogous to others already noticed, and very different from any that occur in Tuscany. As the meteor from which they were discharged appeared on the morning after a violent eruption of Vesuvius, they were at first supposed to be volcanic, till cool reflection and examination betrayed the extravagance of such a hypothesis. The precise number of stones which were collected on this occasion is not specified, but many of them were small, weighing from a quarter of an ounce to two ounces. A pretty entire specimen occurs in Mr Ferguson's collection.\u2014The date of the Sienna meteor is the 16th of June, 1794.\n\nOn the 13th of December of the following year, about three o'clock in the afternoon, another of these singular stones, weighing 56 pounds, fell near the country house of Captain Topham, in Yorkshire. The captain's report, which is inserted in the Gentleman's Magazine for 1796, is distinct and satisfactory; while the chemical examination of the mass, detailed in Mr Howard's paper, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1802, affords a still more decisive proof of its atmospheric origin. M. de Dr\u00e9e, also, found it to correspond exactly in aspect and character, with fragments of meteor stones from Benares and Ville-franche. The original mass is in the possession of Mr Sowerby author of English Botany, &c. It is larger than a man's head.\n\nMr Southey, in his letters from Spain and Portugal, transcribes the authenticated relation of another instance of the descent of a stone from the clouds on the 19th of February 1796. But we pass to some of the most important details relative to the stone which is affirmed to have fallen near Ville-franche, in the department of the Rhone, on the 12th of March, 1798. When it was transmitted to Professor Sage, member of the National Institute, he considered it at first, as only a pyritous and magnetic ore of iron, although it bore no resemblance to any known species of ore of that metal, since it contained nickel, silica, magnesia, and native iron, which shone like steel when polished. \"It is of an ash gray colour,\" says M. Sage, granulated and speckled with gray, thinning, and pyritous metallic points. One of its surfaces is covered with a dingy-black enamel, about the third of a line in thickness. This stone acts very powerfully on the magnetic needle. When the senator Chaffet transmitted it to me, it...\nwas accompanied by an historical notice of similar import with that which M. Delivre, of Ville-franche, who saw and described the phenomenon on the spot.\n\nAt six o'clock in the evening, a round body, which diffused the most vivid light, was observed in the vicinity of Ville-franche, moving westward, and producing a hissing, like that of a bomb which traverses the air. This luminous body, which was seen at the same time at Lyons and on Mont-Cenis, marked its path by a red track of fire, and exploded, about 200 toises from the earth, with a tremendous report and concussion. One of the flaming fragments fell on the vineyard of Peter Crepier, an inhabitant of Sales. On the spot where this portion of the meteor was seen to fall, and in a fresh opening of about 20 inches in depth, and 18 in width, was found a black mass, 15 inches in diameter, and rounded on one side.\n\nAn account of the same meteor was published in the Journal de Physique, for Floreal, year 11, by M. de Dr\u00e9e. From his minute and deliberate investigation, it appears that the fire-ball had scarcely fixed the attention of the inhabitants of the Sales and of the adjacent villages, when its rapid approach, accompanied by a terrible whizzing noise, like that of an irregular hollow body, traversing the air with unusual velocity, inspired the whole commune with alarm, especially when they observed it passing over their heads, at an inconsiderable elevation. It left behind a long train of light, and emitted, with an almost unceasing crackling, small vivid flames, like little stars. Its fall was remarked, at the distance of only 50 paces, by three labourers, one of whom, named Montillard, let fall his coat and bundle of sticks that he might run the faster, while the other two, Chardon and Lapoec, fled with equal precipitation to Sales, where the alarm had become general.\u2014These three witnesses attest the astonishing rapidity of the meteor's motion, and the hissing which proceeded from the spot where it fell. So terrified was Crepier at the explosion, that he locked himself up with his family, first in his cellar, and then in his private apartment, not venturing abroad till next morning, when, in the company of M. Blandel, Chardon, Lapoec, and many others, he repaired to the opening which had been made by the fire-ball. At the bottom of this opening, which was 18 inches deep, including the entire thickness of the mould, they found a large black mass, of an irregularly oval form, having a fanciful resemblance to a calf's head. Though no longer hot, it smelled of gun-powder and was cracked in several places. When the observers broke it, and discovered nothing but stone, indifference succeeded to curiosity, and they coolly ascribed its appearance to causes more or less whimsical and supernatural.\n\nThe original weight of this stone was about twenty pounds. Its black vitrified surface gave fire with steel. Its interior was hard, earthy, ash-coloured, of a granular texture, presenting different substances scattered through it, namely, iron in grains, from the smallest size to a line or even more in diameter, somewhat malleable, but harder and whiter than forged iron; white pyrites, both lamellated and granular, and in colour approaching to nickel; some gray globules, which seemed to present the characters of trapp, and a very few and small particles of steatite, inclining to an olive hue. On account of its heterogeneous composition, its specific gravity could not be easily ascertained. One hundred parts of the mass gave, according to Vauquelin, 46 of silica, 38 oxide of iron, 15 magnesia, 2 nickel, and 2 lime. The excess of this result was ascribed to the absorption of oxygen by the native iron during the process. A small specimen of this mass belongs to Mr Fergulon's collection.\n\nOn the 19th of December 1798, about eight o'clock in the evening, the inhabitants of Benares and its neighbourhood observed in the heavens a very luminous meteor, in the form of a large ball of fire, which exploded with a loud noise, and from which a number of stones were precipitated near Krakhtu, a village about fourteen miles from the city of Benares. Mr Davis, the judge and magistrate of the district, affirmed that its brilliancy equalled the brightest moonlight. Both he and Mr Enskine, the assistant collector, were induced to send persons in whom they could confide to the spot where this shower of stones was asserted to have taken place, and thus obtained additional evidence of the phenomenon, and several of the stones, which had penetrated about six inches into fields recently watered. Mr Maclean, a gentleman who resided near Krakhtu, presented Mr Howard with part of a stone, which had been brought to him the morning after its descent, by the watchman who was on duty at his house, and through the roof of whose hut it had passed, and buried itself several inches in the floor, which was of consolidated earth. Before it was broken, it must have weighed upwards of two pounds.\n\nAt the time that this meteor appeared, the sky was perfectly serene; not the slightest vestige of a cloud had been seen since the 11th of the month, nor was any observed for many days after.\n\n\"Of these stones (says Mr Howard,) I have seen eight nearly perfect, besides parts of several others, which had been broken by the possessors, to distribute among their friends. The form of the more perfect ones appeared to be that of an irregular cube, rounded off at the edges; but the angles were to be observed on most of them. They were of various sizes, from about three to upwards of four inches in their largest diameter; one of them, measuring four inches and a quarter, weighed two pounds twelve ounces. In appearance they were exactly similar; externally they were covered with a hard black coat, or incrustation, which in some parts had the appearance of varnish or bitumen; and on most of them were fractures, which, from their being covered with a matter similar to that of the coat, seemed to have been made in the fall, by the stones striking against each other, and to have passed through some medium, probably an intense heat, previous to their reaching the earth. Internally they consisted of a number of small spherical bodies, of a slate colour, imbedded in a whitish gritty substance, interspersed with bright shining speckles, of a metallic or pyritical nature. The spherical bodies were much harder than the rest of the stone: the white gritty part readily crumbled, on being rubbed with a hard body; and, on being broken, a quantity attached itself to the magnet, but more particularly the outside coat or crust, which appeared almost wholly attachable by it.\"\n\nHere we are furnished with another circumstantial and authenticated narrative, by individuals above the rank\nrank of suspicion, and who were prompted solely by motives of curiosity, to examine with due deliberation the particulars which they have reported.\n\nThe history of the extraordinary shower of stones which fell near l'Aigle, in Normandy, on the 26th of April 1803, first appeared in the ensuing letters letter, addressed by M. Marais, an inhabitant of the place, to his friend in Paris.\n\n\"At l'Aigle, the 13th Flor\u00e9al, year II.\n\n\"An astonishing miracle has just occurred in our district. Here it is, without alteration, addition, or diminution. It is certain, that it is the truth itself.\n\n\"On Friday last, 6th Flor\u00e9al (26th April), between one and two o'clock in the afternoon, we were roused by a murmuring noise like thunder. On going out we were surprised to see the sky pretty clear, with the exception of some small clouds. We took it for the noise of a carriage, or of fire in the neighbourhood. We were then in the meadow, to examine whence the noise proceeded, when we observed all the inhabitants of the Pont de Pierre at their windows, and in gardens, inquiring concerning a cloud, which passed in the direction of from south to north, and from which the noise issued, although that cloud presented nothing extraordinary in its appearance. But great was our astonishment when we learned, that many and large stones had fallen from it, some of them weighing ten, eleven, and even seventeen pounds, in the space between the house of the Buat family (half a league to the north-north-east of l'Aigle) and Glos, passing by St Nicolas, St Pierre, &c., which struck us at first as a fable, but which was afterwards found to be true.\n\n\"The following is the explanation given of this extraordinary event by all who witnessed it.\n\n\"They heard a noise like that of a cannon, then a double report still louder than the preceding, followed by a rumbling noise, which lasted about ten minutes, the same which we also heard, accompanied with hiftings, caused by these stones, which were counteracted in their fall by the different currents of air, which is very natural in the case of such a sudden expansion. Nothing more was heard; but it is remarkable, that previously to the explosion, the domestic fowls were alarmed, and the cows bellowed in an unusual manner.\n\nAll the country-folks were much dismayed, especially the women, who believed that the end of the world was at hand. A labourer at la Sapee fell prostrate on the ground, exclaiming, 'Good God! is it possible that thou canst make me perish thus? Pardon, I beseech thee, all the faults I have committed,' &c. The most trifling objects, in fact, might create alarm, for it is not improbable, that history offers no example of such a shower of stones as this. The piece which I find was detached from a large one, weighing eleven pounds, which was found between the house of the Buaus and le Fertey. It is said, that a collector of curiosities purchased one of seventeen pounds weight, that he might send it to Paris. Every body in this part of the country is deafened of possessing a whole stone, or a fragment of one, as an object of curiosity. The largest were darted with such violence that they entered at least a foot into the earth. They are black on the outside, and grayish, as you see, within, seeming to contain some species of metal and nitre. If you know before us of what ingredients they are composed, you will inform us. One fell near M. Bois de la Ville, who lives near Glos. He was much afraid, and took shelter under a tree. He has found a great number of them of different sizes, in his court-yard, his wheat fields, &c., without reckoning all those which the peasants have found elsewhere. Numberless stories, more or less absurd, have been circulated among the people. You know that our country is fertile in such tales. Cousin Moutardier sends one of these stones to Mademoiselle H\u00e9bert; and he is not less eager than we are, to know how these substances can be compressed and petrified in the air. Do try to explain the process.\n\n\"The person who gave me the largest stone which I send to you, went to take it at the moment that it fell, but it was so hot that it burned him. Several of his neighbours shared the same fate in attempting to lift it.\n\n\"The elder Buat has just arrived, and desires us to add, that a fire-ball was observed to hover over the meadow. Perhaps it was wild-fire.\"\n\nAt the sitting of the institute, on the 9th of May, Fourcroy read a letter, addressed from l'Aigle to Vauquelin, and which sufficiently corroborates the preceding statements. But we pass to the substance of M. Biot's letter, addressed to the minister of the interior, and published in the Journal des D\u00e9bats, (14th Thermidor, year II.). The writer, who is advantageously known for his scientific attainments, was deputed by government to repair to the spot, and collect all the authentic facts. The contents of his letter have been since expanded into the form of a memoir, which manifests the caution and good sense which guided his inquiries, and which, we are surprised to learn, has not appeared in an English translation.\n\nM. Biot left Paris on the 25th of June, and in place of proceeding directly to l'Aigle, went first to Alen\u00e7on, which lies fifteen leagues to the west-south-west of it. He was informed on his way, that a globe of fire had been observed moving towards the north, and that its appearance was followed by a violent explosion. From Alen\u00e7on he journeyed through various villages to l'Aigle, being directed in his progress by the accounts of the inhabitants, who had all heard the explosion on the day and at the hour specified. Almost all the inhabitants of twenty hamlets, scattered over an extent of upwards of two leagues square affirmed that they were eye-witnesses of a dreadful shower of stones which was darted from the meteor. The following is his summary of the whole evidence.\n\n\"On Tuesday, 6th Flor\u00e9al, year II., about one o'clock, P.M. the weather being serene, there was observed from Caen, Pont d'Audemer, and the environs of Alen\u00e7on, Falaise, and Verneuil, a fiery globe, of a very brilliant splendor, and which moved in the atmosphere with great rapidity. Some moments after, there was heard at l'Aigle, and in the environs of that town, in the extent of more than thirty leagues in every direction, a violent explosion, which lasted five or six minutes. At first there were three or four reports, like those of cannon, followed by a kind of discharge which resembled the firing of musketry; after which there was heard a dreadful rumbling like\nthe beating of a drum. The air was calm, and the sky serene, except a few clouds, such as are frequently observed.\n\n\"This noise proceeded from a small cloud which had a rectangular form, the largest side being in a direction from east to west. It appeared motionless all the time that the phenomenon lasted; but the vapors of which it was composed, were projected momentarily from different sides, by the effect of the successive explosions. This cloud was about half a league to the north-north-west of the town of l'Aigle. It was at a great elevation in the atmosphere, for the inhabitants of two hamlets, a league distant from each other, saw it at the same time above their heads. In the whole canton over which this cloud was suspended, there was heard a hissing noise like that of a stone discharged from a sling, and a great many mineral masses exactly similar to those distinguished by the name of meteorites were seen to fall.\n\n\"The district in which these masses were projected, forms an elliptical extent of about two leagues and a half in length, and nearly one in breadth, the greatest dimension being in a direction from south-east to north-west, forming a declination of about 22 degrees. This direction, which the meteor must have followed, is exactly that of the magnetic meridian, which is a remarkable result. The greatest of these stones fell at the south-eastern extremity of the large axis of the ellipse, the middle-sized in the centre, and the smaller at the other extremity. Hence it appears that the largest fell first, as might naturally be supposed. The largest of all those that fell weighs seventeen pounds and a half. The smallest which I have seen weighs about two gros (a thousandth part of the last). The number of all those which fell is certainly above two or three thousand.\"\n\nAs we cannot make room for an analysis of M. Biot's more extended communication, we shall be contented to select only two facts.\n\nThe cur\u00e9 of St Michael declared, that he observed one of the stones fall, with a hissing noise, at the feet of his niece, in the court yard of his parsonage, and that it rebounded upwards of a foot from the pavement. He instantly requested his niece to fetch it to him; but as she was too much alarmed, a woman who happened also to be on the spot, took it up; and it was found in every respect to resemble the others.\n\nAs one Piche, a wire manufacturer belonging to the village of Arm\u00e9es, was working with his men in the open air, a stone grazed his arm, and fell at his feet; but it was so hot, that, on attempting to take it up, he instantly let it fall again.\n\nHe who compares the various accounts of the l'Aigle meteor, with a critical eye, may detect some apparent contradictions, which, however, on reflection, are found to be strictly conformable to truth. Thus, according to some, the meteor had a rapid motion, others believed it stationary; some saw a very luminous ball of fire, others only an ordinary cloud. Spectators, in fact, viewed it in different positions with respect to its direction. They who happened to be in its line of march, would see it stationary, for the same reason, that we fancy a ship under full sail to be motionless, when we are placed in its wake, or when we view it from the harbour to which it is approaching in a straight line.\n\nThey, on the other hand, who had a side view of the meteor, would reckon its progress the more rapid, in proportion as their position approached to a right angle with its line of passage. They, again, who saw it from behind, as the inhabitants of l'Aigle, would perceive only the cloud of vapour, which it left in its train, and which, in the dark, would figure like a blazing tail, in the same manner as the smoke of a volcano appears black during the day and red at night. Lastly, they who were placed in front of the meteor, would reckon it stationary, but brilliant and cloudless.\n\nIt deserves to be remarked, that the l'Aigle stones were very friable for some days after their descent, that they gradually acquired hardness, and that after they had lost the sulphurous odour on their surface, they still retained it in their substances, as was found by breaking them. Professor Sage submitted them to several comparative trials with those of Ville-franche; and, though the l'Aigle specimens present some globules of the size of a small coriander seed, of a darker gray than the mats, and not attractable by the magnet, yet, in respect of granular texture and general aspect, the coincidence was so striking as to lead one to suppose that they were all parts of the same mats.\n\nThe l'Aigle stones, according to Fourcroy, are generally irregular, polygonal, often cuboid, sometimes subcuneiform, and exceedingly various in their diameter and weight. All are covered with a black gravelly crust, consisting of a fused matter, and filled with small agglutinated grains of iron. The greater part of them are broken at the corners, either by their shock against each other, or by falling on hard bodies. The internal parts resemble those of all the stones analyzed by Messrs. Howard and Vauquelin, being gray, a little varied in their shades, granulated, and as it were fleshy, split in many parts, and filled with brilliant metallic points, exactly of the same aspect as those of other stones of a like description. The proportions of their constituent materials are stated as nearly, 54 siliceous, 36 oxidated iron, 9 magnesia, 3 nickel, 2 sulphur, and 1 lime, the five per cent. of increase arising from the oxidation of the metals produced by the analysis.\n\nOf the two specimens which M. Biot presented to the celebrated Patrin, one was less compact, and of a lighter gray than the other, and likewise presented small patches of a rusty colour. When immersed in water, it gave a hissing sound, like the humming of a fly, which is held by one wing. As it began to dry, it was observed to be marked by curvilinear and parallel layers. The more compact specimens, when moistened, presented no such appearances, but assumed the aspect of a gray porphyry, with a base of trap, mottled with small white spots, and speckled with metallic points.\n\nTwo fine specimens of the l'Aigle stone, one of them nearly entire, may be seen in Mr. Ferguson's collection, which we have already repeatedly quoted.\n\nPreviously to the explosion of the 26th of April 1803, no meteorites had been found by the inhabitants of the l'Aigle district, nor in the mineralogical collections of the department; nor the slightest mention of them made in the geological documents of this portion of Normandy: the mines, foundries, and forges, had produced nothing similar, in the form of dross or ore, nor had the country exhibited any trace of volcanoes.\nThe meteor at once appears, and a multitude of stones of the peculiar character noted above are seen scattered on a determined space of ground, in a manner, and accompanied with circumstances, which could not formerly have escaped observation. Let us likewise reflect, that the young and the old, simple peasants dwelling at a distance from one another, sagacious and rational workmen, respectable ecclesiastics, young soldiers devoid of timidity, individuals, in short, of various manners, professions, and opinions, united by no common ties, all agree in attesting a fact, which contributed neither directly nor indirectly to promote their own interest, and they all assign the manifestation of this fact to the same day and hour. They, moreover, point to existing vestiges of the descent of solid substances, and they declare, in terms unsusceptible of misconception or ambiguity, that they saw the masses in question roll down on roofs, break branches of trees, rebound from the pavement, and produce smoke where they fell. These recitals, and these vestiges, are limited to a tract of territory which has been accurately defined; while beyond the precincts of this tract, not a single particle of a meteorite has been found, nor a single individual who pretends that he saw stone fall.\n\nHaving now, we presume, advanced ample and satisfactory evidence of the existence of meteorites, we shall forbear to enlarge this article by dwelling on instances of inferior notoriety to those which we have recounted, and shall merely note the dates of subsequent examples.\n\nOn the 4th of July 1803, a fire-ball struck the White Bull Inn at East-Norton, and left behind it several meteoric fragments.\u2014On the 13th of December of the same year, a similar phenomenon occurred at the village of St Nicholas, in Bavaria.\u2014At Poffil, near Glasgow in Scotland, a meteor-stone fell, with a loud and hissing noise, on the 5th April 1804.\u2014The next instance which we have to mention occurred near Apt, in the department of Vaucluse, on the 6th of October of the same year; and the last which has come to our knowledge happened at half past five o'clock, in the evening of the 15th March 1806, near Aigues in Languedoc.\n\nIt seems reasonable, however, to suppose, that the fall of meteoric substances takes place more frequently than is commonly supposed, since several foreign collections of fossils contain specimens of reputed celestial origin, and exhibiting the genuine atmospheric physiognomy. It is likewise worthy of remark, that many relations of the phenomenon may have sunk into oblivion, from the contempt with which they were heard by the learned, and that, on a fair computation of chances, meteors may have sometimes exploded on desert tracts of land, and still more frequently over the pathless expanse of the waters.\n\nThat some of the relations to which we have alluded are vague and unsatisfactory, cannot be denied, but the circumstantial testimony conveyed by others is more pointed and positive; and the whole mass of historical proof, especially when combined with the argument deduced from the identity of the physical and chemical constitution of the stones, appears to us to be altogether irresistible.\n\nIn the course of our inquiry into this novel and interesting subject, we have ascertained a variety of circumstances which render it highly probable, if not indubitable, that those detached masses of native iron, whose history has so often staggered and perplexed the geologist, are only modifications of meteoric depositions. The Tartars, for example, ascribe the descent of the Siberian mass described by Chladni, Pallas, Patrin, &c., to a period that is lost in the remoteness of antiquity; and while tradition thus favours our hypothesis, the analogy which is obviously observable in point of texture and chemical characters with those of other solid bodies, whose fall is no longer questioned, strengthens tradition. According to the discoveries of Proult and Klaproth, native iron, reputed meteoric, differs from that which occurs in a fossil state by the presence of nickel. The former of these celebrated analysts obtained 50 grains of sulphate of nickel from 100 of the South American mass, and his results are corroborated by Mr Howard and the Count de Bournon.\n\nOf the two pieces of Siberian iron possessed by Mr Greville, one, which was transmitted by Dr Pallas, weighs several pounds; and another presents a cellular and ramified texture, analogous to that of some very light and porous volcanic scoriae. When attentively examined, there may be perceived in it not only empty cells, but also impressions or cavities of greater or less depth, and in some of which there remains a transparent substance, of a yellowish green colour. The iron itself is very malleable; and may be easily cut with a knife, or flattened under the hammer. The specific gravity is 6.487, which is obviously inferior to that of unforged iron that has undergone fusion, and may be partly owing to the oxidization of the surface of the iron, and partly to the many minute cavities in its substance, which are often rendered visible by fracture, and which have their surface also oxidized. The fracture is shining and silvery, like that of white cast iron; but its grain is much smoother and finer; and it is much more malleable when cold. The heavier specimen is more solid and compact, exhibiting no cavities or pores, though its surface is ramified and cellular. So blended and incorporated is its compact part with the yellowish-green substance mentioned above, that if the whole of the latter could be subtracted, the remainder would consist of iron in the metallic state, and would display the same cellular appearance as the preceding specimen, or as the superficial portion of that now described. This stony part of the composition usually assumes the appearance of small nodules, generally of an irregular shape, but sometimes nearly globular, with a smooth, shining, and glassy surface. This substance, which is always more or less transparent, is hard enough to cut glass, but makes no impression on quartz. It becomes electric by friction, is very refractory, and varies in specific gravity from 3.263 to 3.300. Of all substances hitherto known, it approaches most to the peridot, or Wernerian chrysoelite, which yielded to Klaproth nearly the same results which this substance did to Howard. In the mass of iron, it is liable to decomposition, changing to an opaque white, and crumbling into a gritty dry powder, when lightly pressed or squeezed between the fingers.\u2014\"I cannot help observing (says the count de Bournon), that there appears to exist a very interesting analogy between these transparent nodules and the globules I described as making part of the stones said...\"\nto have fallen on the earth. This analogy, though not a very strong one, may lead us to suppose, that the two substances are similar in their nature, but that the globules are less pure, and contain a greater quantity of iron.\"\n\nThe native iron from Bohemia is compact, like the large specimen from Siberia, in Mr Greville's collection, and like it contains nodules, but not so numerous. They are besides quite opake, and very much resemble the globules in atmospheric stones. This iron contains nearly five per cent. of nickel. Between five and six per cent. of the same metal seems to exist in a piece of native iron brought from Senegal.\n\nThough our limits will not permit us to dwell with minuteness on the physical and chemical characters of meteorites, we shall shortly state those which the count de Bourmont found to appertain to the specimens from Benares, and which may serve as no unfair standard of the aspect and composition of the others.\n\nLike all of the same origin which were subjected to the count's examination, the Benares stones are covered over the whole extent of their surface, with a thin crust, of a deep black colour, sprinkled over with small apertures, which make it feel somewhat like flaxseed or silt skin. Their fracture exhibits a grayish ash colour, and a granulated texture, like that of coarse grit-stone. By help of a lens, they are perceived to be composed of four different substances. One of these occurs in great abundance, in the form of small bodies, some of which are perfectly globular, others rather elongated or elliptical, and all of various sizes, from that of a small pin's head to that of a pea, or nearly so. These small globules are usually gray, sometimes inclining much to brown, and always opake; they are easily broken in any direction, have a conchoidal fracture, and a fine, smooth, compact grain, with a slight degree of lustre, approaching to enamel; lastly, they can destroy the polish of glass without being able to cut it, and sparkle faintly when struck with steel. Another of these substances is martial pyrites, of an indeterminate form, and reddish yellow colour, slightly verging to the nickel tint, or to that of artificial pyrites; of a somewhat loosely granulated texture, and irregularly distinguished in the mass, being black when reduced to powder, and not attractible by the magnet. The third of these substances consists of small particles of iron, in a perfectly metallic state, so that they may be easily flattened or extended under the hammer. Though in a much smaller proportion than the pyrites just mentioned, they impart the magnetic attraction to the stone. When a piece of the latter was pulverized, and the particles of iron separated from it as accurately as possible, by means of a magnet, they appeared to compose about 200 parts of the weight of the stone. These three substances are united by means of a fourth, which is nearly of an earthly consistency, and of a whitish gray colour.\u2014The black crust, or outward coating, though of very inconsiderable thickness, emits bright sparks when struck with steel, may be broken by the hammer, and seems to possess the same properties with the black oxide of iron, though, like the substance of the stone, it is occasionally intermixed with small particles of iron in the metallic state. These are easily distinguished, by passing a file over the crust, which reveals their lustre. The specific gravity of the Benares stones is 3.52.\n\nNone of them, when breathed on, emit the argillaceous meteorite odour.\n\nIn consequence of various experiments, M. Sage infers that meteorites are composed of native iron, sulphuret of nickel, quartz or silica, alumina, and magnesia; that the proportions of iron and nickel vary; that the quartz seems to form at least the half of the stone, the alumina and magnesia the fifth, and the sulphur the 30th part. These general results pretty nearly accord with the more special reports of Howard and Vauquelin, except that the latter makes no mention of alumina, the existence of which in atmospheric stones is by no means distinctly ascertained.\n\nWe shall only beg leave to add, on this part of our subject, that Laugier, an ingenious chemist, by employing the caustic alkali, has detected a small portion of chrome. The results of his experiments, which are stated in the 58th volume of the Annales de Chimie, are:\n\n1st. That the five stones from Verona, Barbotan, Ensillicium, l'Aigle, and the neighbourhood of Apt, besides the principles already recognized, contain about one per cent. of chrome.\n\n2dly. That it is very probable, that all meteorites contain this principle, since they all resemble one another in their physical and chemical properties, and have all, apparently, the same origin;\n\nand, 3dly. That in many cases, the perfection of chemical analysis requires, that the same substance should be treated both by acids and alkalies, since experience has shown, that a principle which eluded the former method, has been revealed by the latter.\n\nHaving now, as we apprehend, sufficiently established the existence and nature of meteorites, we hope our readers will excuse us from enlarging on the various causes which have been assigned for their origin, as these seem to lie beyond the reach of our present state of knowledge. After a candid and patient review of the principal theories, we conceive that they are at best gratuitous, and that most of them are open to many and formidable objections.\n\nThe terrestrial hypotheses, we believe, begin already to be generally abandoned, as untenable. Until the phenomenon of exploding meteors had been distinctly observed and recorded, Lenoir and others could maintain, with some degree of plausibility, that lightning might tear up the ground, and convert soil into a compact mass. But the appearances of a thunder storm and of a fire-ball are now ascertained to differ in various important respects. Spectators worthy of credit have seen the latter terminate in the fall of solid bodies; and the composition of these solid bodies has been found to differ from that of all the known fossil substances on the surface of the globe. It is in vain, then, to allege, that they are formed on the ground by common lightning, which has often produced very extraordinary effects, but which never generated thousands of stones in fine calm weather. The supposition, that such stones have been projected from some of our volcanoes, is hardly less conceivable. The ashes which accompany a violent eruption of Etna or Vesuvius have, from their levity, been carried to a very considerable distance; but we are totally unacquainted with any projectile force which could dart solid masses many hundred miles, through such a dense medium as the atmosphere. The compact lavas of burning mountains are never found\nfound remote from the scene of their formation, and none of them present the characters and aspect of the stones which we have described. M. Bory de St Vincent, indeed, in his *Voyage dans les quatre Principales \u00celes des Mers d'Afrique*, very pompously expounds a doctrine, which, in our opinion, carries its confusion along with it. According to this writer, meteorites were projected from immense depths, in an early stage of the earth's existence, when igneous mountains were ended with propelling forces sufficient to drive masses of matter into the regions of space, where they were constrained to obey, for ages, the combined laws of impulse and gravitation, until, in the progress of time, their spiral revolutions at length terminated on the surface of their native earth. Before we can adopt such an extravagant hypothesis, we must be convinced, that at one period of the history of our globe, the agency of subterranean fire was adequate to communicate planetary motion to splinters of rock, without heaving up the rocks themselves, and that the rotatory movement, though once established, must gradually diminish and cease. The demonstration of these positions is surely not less arduous than the explanation of the phenomenon which they are intended to solve.\n\nOf those who contend for the *atmospherical* formation of meteorites, scarcely any two agree in regard to the manner by which such formation is effected. Patrin, who is solicitous to extend and illustrate his darling theory of volcanoes, labours at great length to maintain the existence of a regular circulation of gaseous fluids between the primitive schistose strata of the globe, and its surrounding atmosphere, and, from this fancied circulation, which he flatters himself he has demonstrated, he deduces, quite at his ease, the occasional ignition and concretion of portions of these fluids in the higher regions of the air. This ingenious mineralogist and geologist is so extremely tenacious of these ideas that we shall not attempt to disturb his self complacency; but he will excuse us if we refuse our assent to results which rest on imaginary foundations. The celebrated Mulchenbroeck, in one part of his writings, attributes the descent of stones from the air to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, an opinion which later observations have disproved. In other passages, however, he seems to incline to a modification of the atmospherical hypotheses, and endeavours to trace the origin of shooting stars to an accumulation of the volatile matters which are suspended in the air. It is extremely probable, that shooting stars and fiery meteors have an intimate relation to one another, if they are not identical appearances; but it is certain that the former move at a much greater distance from our earth than fireballs, and only occasion a transient luminous appearance in their passage through the upper regions of the atmosphere. Perhaps they are analogous to those telegraphic sparks of light which were observed by M. Schr\u00f6ter. Mulchenbroeck, however, adopts the vulgar notion of their falling to the earth, and seems to confound their residue with *tremella nufloc*. M. Salverte has given extension to the theory of formation from vapours, by having recourse to the agency of hydrogen gas. According to him, in consequence of the decomposition of water, which is constantly going on at the surface of the earth, immense quantities of hydrogen gas are continually rising into the atmosphere, and ascending to its higher regions. As this gas is capable of dissolving metals, it carries along with it a portion of iron and nickel. During thunder storms this gas is kindled by electricity; the metals are depoited, reduced, melted, and vitrified; in other words, meteors are produced and stones formed. This hypothesis is scarcely more satisfactory than the others. It does not account for the presence of magnesia and silica, nor does it explain why the stones are always composed of the same materials. Besides, the existence of hydrogen gas in the atmosphere has not been proved, far less that it forms a separate atmosphere, which is contrary to all experience; and it is well known, that a little hydrogen, mixed with a large portion of atmospheric air, cannot be fired by electricity. In general, we may observe, that if the origin of meteorites be really atmospherical, the matters of which they are composed must have existed in one of two states, namely, in very attenuated particles or concretions of the matters themselves volatilized and held in solution in the air, or only in the elements of these matters. In the first case, when abandoned by their menstruum to their reciprocal tendencies, they would unite by aggregation only; in the second by chemical combination. Now, we can hardly suppose that disengagement of light and violent detonation should result from the mere affinity of aggregation, whereas they are strictly symptomatic of the affinity of composition. This, and various other considerations which might be stated, if we could make room for them, induce us to regard the doctrine of combination as the most plausible. M. Izarn, who has published a treatise on *Atmospheric Lithology*, has entered into a tedious and somewhat obscure exposition of his own theory, founded on this principle. We shall give the summary, as nearly as we can, in his own words.\n\n\"Gaseous substances, arranged in spherical masses in the upper regions of the air, being admitted, the various agitations of the atmosphere should naturally waft some of these masses from their inflating medium into one capable of combining with them. If the combination begins, the disengagement of light is explained. In proportion as the combination advances, the specific gravities are changed; and, consequently, a change of place will commence, and that in the quarter which presents least resistance, or where the medium is most rarefied, in course rather towards the south than the north. Hence, most fire-balls are observed to move from north to south, or from north-east to south-west. Motion being once impressed, the mass traverses other media, capable of supplying new principles, which still increasing the weight, determine the curve; and when at length the principles which are at work, and which issue in all directions, have attained the requisite proportion for extinguishing the elements in the birth of the compound, the grand operation is announced by the explosion, and the product takes its place among the solids.\"\u2014That the stones in question are produced by chemical combination in the higher regions of the atmosphere, and that they are thus formed from their own elements, are suppositions fully as probable as any that have been advanced on the subject; but whether the union of their parts be effected in the manner detailed by M. Izarn, we are unable to determine, both because we are uncertain if we perfectly comprehend\nhis meaning, and because our range of data is as yet too circumscribed, to warrant any specific or decisive conclusions.\n\nA much bolder theory has been suggested, and its possibility demonstrated by the celebrated French astronomer, La Place, who shews, that meteorites may be the products of lunar volcanoes. As this romantic view of the subject has obtained the suffrages of some men of science, and has excited the ridicule of others, we shall present the reasoning on which it is founded in the popular and perspicuous language of Dr Hutton of Woolwich.\n\n\"As the attraction of gravitation extends through the whole planetary system, a body placed at the surface of the moon is affected chiefly by two forces, one drawing it toward the centre of the earth, and another drawing it toward that of the moon. The latter of these forces, however, near the moon's surface, is incomparably the greater. But, as we recede from the moon, and approach toward the earth, this force decreases, while the other augments; till at last a point of attraction is found between the two planets, where these forces are exactly equal, so that a body placed there must remain at rest; but if it be removed still nearer to the earth, then this planet would have the superior attraction, and the body must fall towards it. If a body then be projected from the moon towards the earth, with a force sufficient to carry it beyond the point of equal attraction, it must necessarily fall on the earth. Such then is the idea of the manner in which the bodies must be made to pass from the moon to the earth, if that can be done, the possibility of which is now necessary to be considered.\n\n\"Now supposing a mass to be projected from the moon, in a direct line towards the earth, by a volcano, or by the production of steam by subterranean heat; and supposing for the present these two planets to remain at rest; then it has been demonstrated, on the Newtonian estimation of the moon's mass, that a force projecting the body with a velocity of 12,000 feet in a second, would be sufficient to carry it beyond the point of equal attraction. But this estimate of the moon's mass is now allowed to be much above the truth; and on M. la Place's calculation, it appears that a force of little more than half the above power would be sufficient to produce the effect, that is, a force capable of projecting a body with a velocity of less than a mile and a half per second. But we have known cannon balls projected by the force of gunpowder, with a velocity of 2500 feet per second or upwards, that is, about half a mile. It follows, therefore, that a projectile force, communicating a velocity about three times that of a cannon ball, would be sufficient to throw the body from the moon beyond the point of equal attraction, and cause it to reach the earth. Now there can be little doubt that a force equal to that is exerted by volcanoes on the earth, as well as by the production of steam by subterranean heat, when we consider the huge masses of rock, so many times larger than cannon balls, thrown on such occasions to heights also so much greater. We may easily imagine, too, such cause of motion to exist in the moon as well as in the earth, and that in a superior degree, if we may judge from the supposed symptoms of volcanoes recently observed in the moon by the powerful tubes of Dr Herschel; and still more, if we consider that all projections from the earth suffer an enormous resistance and diminution, by the dense atmosphere of this planet; while it has been rendered probable, from optical considerations, that the moon has little or no atmosphere at all, to give any such resistance to projectiles.\n\n\"Thus then we are fully authorized in concluding, that the case of possibility is completely made out; that a known power exists in nature, capable of producing the foregoing effect, of detaching a mass of matter from the moon, and transferring it to the earth in the form of a flaming meteor, or burning stone; at the same time we are utterly ignorant of any other process in nature by which the same phenomenon can be produced. Having thus discovered a way in which it is possible to produce those appearances, we shall now endeavour to show, from all the concomitant circumstances, that these accord exceedingly well with the natural effects of the supposed cause, and thence give it a very high degree of probability.\n\n\"This important desideratum will perhaps be best attained, by examining the consequences of a substance supposed to be projected by a volcano from the moon into the sphere of the earth's superior attraction; and then comparing those with the known and visible phenomena of the blazing meteors or burning stones that fall through the air on the earth. And if in this comparison a striking coincidence or resemblance shall always or mostly be found, it will be difficult for the human mind to resist the persuasion that the assumed cause involves a degree of probability but little short of certainty itself. Now the chief phenomena attending these blazing meteors or burning stones, are these:\n\n1. That they appear or blaze out suddenly.\n2. That they move with a surprising rapid motion, nearly horizontal, but a little inclined downwards.\n3. That they move in several different directions with respect to the points of the compass.\n4. That in their flight they yield a loud whizzing sound.\n5. That they commonly burst with a violent explosion and report.\n6. That they fall on the earth with great force in a sloping direction.\n7. That they are very hot at first, remain hot a considerable time, and exhibit visible tokens of fusion on their surface.\n8. That the fallen stony masses have all the same external appearance and contexture, as well as internally the same nature and composition.\n9. That they are totally different from all our terrestrial bodies, both natural and artificial.\n\n\"Now these phenomena will naturally compare with the circumstances of a substance projected by a lunar volcano, and in the order in which they are here enumerated. And first, with respect to the leading circumstance, that of a sudden blazing meteoric appearance, which is not that of a small bright spark, first seen at an immense distance, and then gradually increasing with the diminution of its distance. And this circumstance appears very naturally to result from the assumed cause. For, the body being projected from a lunar volcano, may well be supposed in an ignited state, like inflamed matter thrown up by our terrestrial volcanoes, which passing through the comparatively vacuum, in the space between the moon and the earth's sensible atmosphere, it will probably enter the superior parts of this atmosphere with but little diminution of its original...\"\nnal heat; from which circumstance, united with that of its violent motion, this being 10 or 12 times that of a cannon ball, and through a part of the atmosphere probably consisting chiefly of the inflammable gas rising from the earth to the top of the atmosphere, the body may well be supposed to be suddenly inflamed, as the natural effect of these circumstances; indeed it would be surprising if it did not. From whence it appears that the sudden inflammation of the body, on entering the earth's atmosphere, is exactly what might be expected to happen.\n\n\"2. To trace the body through the earth's atmosphere; we are to observe that it enters the top of it with the great velocity acquired by descending from the point of equal attraction, which is such as would carry the body to the earth's surface in a very few additional seconds of time if it met with no obstruction. But as it enters deeper in the atmosphere, it meets with still more and more resistance from the increasing density of the air, by which the great velocity of six miles per second must soon be greatly reduced to one that will be uniform, and only a small part of its former great velocity. This remaining part of its motion will be various in different bodies, being more or less as the body is larger or smaller, and as it is more or less specifically heavy; but, for a particular instance, if the body were a globe of 12 inches diameter, and of the same gravity as the atmospheric stones, the motion would decrease so as to be little more than a quarter of a mile per second of perpendicular descent. Now while the body is thus descending, the earth itself is affected by a twofold motion, both the diurnal and the annual one, with both of which the descent of the body is to be compounded. The earth's motion of rotation at the equator is about 17 miles in a minute, or two-sevenths of a mile in a second; but in the middle latitudes of Europe little more than half of that, or little above half a quarter of a mile in a second; and if we compound this motion with that of the descending body, as in mechanics, this may cause the body to appear to descend obliquely, though but a little, the motion being nearer the perpendicular than the horizontal direction. But the other motion of the earth, or that in its annual course, is about 20 miles in a second, which is 80 times greater than the perpendicular descent in the instance above-mentioned; so that, if this motion be compounded with the descending one of the body, it must necessarily give it the appearance of a very rapid motion, in a direction nearly parallel to the horizon, but a little declining downwards. A circumstance which exactly agrees with the appearances of these meteoric bodies, as stated in the second article of the enumerated phenomena.\n\n\"3. Again, with regard to the apparent direction of the body; this will evidently be various, being that compounded of the body's descent and the direction of the earth's annual motion at the time of the fall, which is itself various in the different seasons of the year, according to the direction of the several points of the ecliptic to the earth's meridian or axis. Usually, however, from the great excess of the earth's motion above that of the falling body, the direction of this must appear to be nearly opposite to that of the former. And in fact this exactly agrees with a remark made by Dr Halley, in his account of the meteors in his paper above given, where he says that the direction of the meteor's motion was exactly opposite to that of the earth in her orbit. And if this shall generally be found to be the case, it will prove a powerful confirmation of this theory of the lunar substances. Unfortunately, however, the observations on this point are very few, and mostly inaccurate; the angle or direction of the fallen stones has not been recorded; and that of the flying meteor commonly mistaken, all the various observers giving it a different course, some even directly the reverse of others. In future, it will be very advisable that the observers of fallen stones, observe and record the direction or bearing of the perforation made by the body in the earth, which will give us perhaps the course of the path nearer than any other observation.\n\n\"4. In the flight of these meteoric stones, it is commonly observed, that they yield a loud whizzing sound. Indeed it would be surprising if they did not. For if the like sound be given by the smooth and regularly formed cannon ball, and heard at a considerable distance, how exceedingly great must be that of a body so much larger, which is of an irregular form and surface too, and striking the air with 50 or 100 times the velocity.\n\n\"5. That they commonly burst and fly in pieces in their rapid flight, is a circumstance exceedingly likely to happen, both from the violent state of fusion on their surface, and from the extreme rapidity of their motion through the air. If a grinding stone, from its quick rotation, be sometimes burst and fly in pieces, and if the same thing happen to cannon balls when made of stone and discharged with considerable velocity, merely by the friction and resistance of the air; how much more is the same to be expected to happen to the atmospheric stones, moving with more than 50 times the velocity, and when their surface may well be supposed to be partly loosened or dissolved by the extremity of the heat there.\n\n\"6. That the stones strike the ground with a great force, and penetrate to a considerable depth, as is usually observed, is a circumstance only to be expected from the extreme rapidity of their motion, and their great weight, when we consider that a cannon ball, or a mortar shell, will often bury itself many inches, or even some feet in the earth.\n\n\"7. That these stones, when soon sought after and found, are hot, and exhibit the marks of recent fusion, are also the natural consequences of the extreme degree of inflammation in which their surface had been put during their flight through the air.\n\n\"8. That these stony masses have all the same external appearance and contexture, as well as internally the same nature and composition, are circumstances that strongly point out an identity of origin, whatever may be the cause to which they owe so generally uniform a conformation. And when it is considered,\n\n\"9. That in those respects they differ totally from all terrestrial compositions hitherto known or discovered, they lead the mind strongly to ascribe them to some other origin than the earth we inhabit; and none so likely as coming from our neighbouring planet.\n\n\"Upon the whole then (continues Dr Hutton), it appears...\"\nappears highly probable, that the flaming meteors, and the burning stones, that fall on the earth, are one and the same thing. It also appears impossible, or in the extreme degree improbable, to ascribe these either to a formation in the superior parts of the atmosphere, or to the eruptions of terrestrial volcanoes, or to the generation by lightning striking the earth. But, on the other hand, that it is possible for such masses to be projected from the moon so as to reach the earth; and that all the phenomena of these meteors or falling stones, having a surprising conformity with the circumstances of masses that may be expelled from the moon by natural causes, unite in forming a body of strong evidence, that this is in all probability and actually the case.\n\nM. Poisson, an ingenious French mathematician, has shown by an algebraical calculation, the possibility of a projectile reaching our planet from the moon. His calculation, however, which may be found in the work of Izarn, quoted above, (p. 238. et seq.) proceeds on the supposition that our satellite has no atmosphere, or next to none. There are, no doubt, appearances which seem to favour this supposition, but they do not amount to positive proof of the fact. Even could the latter be established, the combustion of a volcano, without the presence of atmospheric air, would remain to be explained. But, granting this difficulty too to be surmounted, there are other circumstances which we cannot easily reconcile to the lunar hypothesis. The occasional arrival of fragments of lava on the earth's surface, would argue, on a fair computation of chances, such a copious discharge of volcanic matters, that the moon, by this time, would consist of hardly any thing else. Again, if we may be allowed to reason from analogy, the volcanic productions of the moon should exhibit varieties of aspect and composition like those with which we are acquainted, and not a definite and precise number of the same ingredients. We may also remark, that the soft and incoherent state of several of the recent specimens of meteorites can ill accord with their supposed pallage through any considerable portion of space; and that the l'Aigle phenomenon, which is so distinctly recorded, evidently suggests the notion of instantaneous formation in the atmosphere. And, though this view of the subject may be regarded by some as inexplicable, we cannot conceive that it is more so than the doctrine of crystallization, or than many of the results of chemical combination, whose existence it is impossible to deny. These and other arguments may, we apprehend, be fairly urged against any theory which attempts to explain the history of meteors by the agency of lunar volcanoes.\n\nThe hypothesis of Dr Chladni, which likewise boasts of its advocates, though still more extravagant than the preceding, deserves to be stated. As earthy, metallic, and other particles form the principal component parts of our planet, among which iron is the prevailing part, other planetary bodies, he affirms, may consist of similar, or, perhaps, the same component parts, though combined and modified in a very different manner. There may also be dense matters accumulated in smaller masses, without being in immediate connexion with the larger planetary bodies, dispersed throughout infinite space, and which, being impelled either by some projecting power or attraction, continue to move until they approach the earth, or some other body; when, being overcome by attractive force, they immediately fall down. By their exceeding great velocity, still increased by the attraction of the earth and the violent friction in the atmosphere, a strong electricity and heat must necessarily be excited, by which means they are reduced to a flaming and melted condition, and great quantities of vapour and different kinds of gases are thus disengaged, which distend the liquid mass to a monstrous size, till, by a still farther expansion of these elastic fluids, they must at length explode. That portions of comical matter are allowed to revolve in space, and to terminate their career on the surface of a planet, is a position too gratuitous and vague, to be readily admitted, but the belief of which involves no principle of atheism or impiety, as some of Dr Chladni's antagonists have very unhandsomely infamated. If worlds disappear and others spring into existence, a sportive imagination may be permitted to indulge in the innocent supposition, that fragments of their materials are detached from their fractured masses, and obey those laws of attraction which seem to extend their influence to the remotest corners of the universe.\n\nSuch of our readers as are solicitous of obtaining more ample information on the subject of this article, may consult Izarn's Lithologie Atmospherique; Biot's Relation d'un Voyage fait dans le departement de l'Orne, pour constater la realite d'un Meteor observe a l'Aigle; Boettiger's Observations on the Accounts given by ancient authors of Stones said to have fallen, from the Clouds; Fulda's Memoir on Fire-balls; Cavallo's Elements of Natural Philosophy; Klaproth on Meteoric Stones; Solandt's Account of the Tufcan Meteor; Chladni's Treatise on the Siberian Masses of Iron; Mr Edward King's Remarks concerning Stones said to have fallen, from the Clouds; and several of the more recent transactions of learned societies and periodical scientific communications, as those of the Royal Society of London, of the Institute at Paris, the Journal de Physique, Annales de Chimie, Bibliotheque Britannique, Decade Philosophique, Journal des Mines, Philosophical Magazine, Nicholson's Journal, &c. &c.","sp":297,"ep":312},{"h":"METEOROLOGICAL","t":"something belonging to meteors.\n\nMeteorological Journal, is a table recording the daily state of the air, exhibited by the barometer, thermometer, hygrometer, anemometer, and other meteorological instruments.

In as far as it describes the phenomena produced by such changes, meteorology is a department of natural history; but in its attempts to account for the appearances, it is almost entirely dependent on Natural Philosophy and Chemistry.\n\nThe connection of Meteorology with Chemistry is sufficiently evident to those who take only a superficial view of the subject, though it has only of late attracted the notice of philosophers. That the air is sometimes hotter and sometimes colder than usual; that it is at one time much rarefied, and at another greatly condensed; now uncommonly dry, and now furnished with moisture\u2014are circumstances that daily meet the senses of the most casual observer, as they are circumstances that powerfully, and often unpleasantly, arrest his attention. That these changes are the result of decompositions and combinations that are continually going on in the atmosphere, and of new modifications of its component principles, is manifest to him who is acquainted merely with the first elements of modern chemistry.\n\nIndeed to modern chemistry this science is indebted for the progress it has made within the last 50 years; a period which may be considered as the second epoch of meteorology. In fact, this science is still in its infancy; but from the ardour with which it is now cultivated, from the abilities of the philosophers who are engaged in the study, and from the progress that is daily making in the kindred sciences, we may reasonably look forward to a period, at no great distance, when it shall please the great Author of nature to unveil many of those wonders which are now involved in darkness and obscurity, and permit us to control the jarring elements, as he has allowed us to exercise dominion over the beasts of the earth, the fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea.\n\nA late ingenious writer on the climate of Britain has suggested some useful hints for the improvement of meteorology, which we shall here extract. \"With this view, our first step must be that recommended by Mr Kirwan and others, to establish corresponding societies in different parts of the world; these societies must be furnished with similar apparatus, equally adjusted, and graduated in their construction, for making observations on the weather. In our own island it will be necessary to procure registers, carefully kept, from the different parts of the sea coast, and from those parts of the country situated in the interior. The various states of the barometer, thermometer, hygrometer, and electroscope, should be carefully noted; with the variations and the degrees of wind, as well as the diurnal and nocturnal aspect of the heavens discriminately marked; the appearance of the sky; and in familiar language, such as might be understood by the respective and distant observers; for instance, whether the sun is totally or partially obscured by vapour;\u2014whether the clouds are mottled, or fleaky;\u2014whether they assume the appearance of horizontal streaks, or appear in radii apparently from a centre\u2014or in masses of dense vapour\u2014or loose and fleecy\u2014or those familiarly known by the name of mare-tail clouds\u2014with any other new or accustomed phenomena. The common terms fair, cloudy, or wet, are insufficient for forming a judgement of the weather; as the term fair is generally at present expressed only in opposition to rain, without distinguishing whether the atmosphere is obscure, dull, or bright. The appearance of the stratum of air on the earth's surface, that is, the space between the clouds and the earth, should be always accurately described. Is there a blue haze, white mist, and dense fog? or is the air transparent? which is the case when distant objects appear more than commonly distinct and near to the eye of the observer: the temperature of the ocean at full tide should be frequently ascertained, as it will be found to have considerable influence in these respects on an insular country. By the remarks of observers, stationed in various parts of our coasts, we should soon be enabled to discover when vapour is wafted in from the sea, or generated by the aqueous and vegetable surface of our island. During a north-west wind, which is frequently attended with storms of hail and rain, and usually experienced in the spring, an observer stationed on the coast of Sligo in Ireland, or Denbighshire in Wales, might ascertain whether the disposition of the atmosphere to storm and cloud came in with the air from the Atlantic ocean, or was generated by the vapours of our own island. It would be desirable also again, that the temperature and blue hazy appearance of the atmosphere during the north-east winds, so common in May and June, should be noticed by observers on the north-east coast, in the counties of York, Lincoln, Essex and Kent; and by others, on the opposite western coasts of Pembroke, Devon, and Cornwall, so as to determine what changes in temperature this wind undergoes in its passage over the island; and whether or not the degree of haze increases or diminishes by its progress from either quarter; and whether the vapour is more or less disposed to produce storms?\n\nBy such comparative observations on the coast, conjoined with those made by others in the central parts of the kingdom, we might rapidly proceed in meteorological science, or, as it is commonly called, a knowledge of the weather. The observations made in the interior of the country would enable us at all times to trace the origin and progress of storms; in situations where tillage or pasturage is most attended to, the effects of spring frosts and blights should be particularly noticed, as well as the first appearance of the aphid and coccus, the caterpillar and larvae of other insects, on fruit trees, and particularly those peculiar to the hop plantations. The first opening of the vernal foliage on trees...\ntrees and hedges in the spring, should likewise be remarked, and compared with the starting up grass on the highly manured pastures in the neighbourhood of towns, and on those also affixed with manure, as well as the natural herbage on the commons and wastes. Some attention should be paid to the effects of thunder storms, in destroying the aphis and other destructive insects, the peat of fruit and hop plantations; and the first appearance of the mildew or rust on wheat should be particularly observed, and remarks made to ascertain, whether or not the moisture, which occasions the disease in its commencement was attended with wind and rain, or a clove damp state of the air. The different kinds of soil, where the crops, from the disease, suffered most, should be noticed, and the situation of the land for ventilation, with the height of the fences, size of inclosures, and vicinity to coppices, trees, or hedge-rows.\n\nThe importance of the study of meteorology requires little elucidation. In climates where the succession of seasons is nearly stated and regular, where the periods of parching drought or deluging torrents, of the tempestuous hurricane or the refreshing breeze, are fixed and ascertained, mankind has little to do, but expect the dreaded changes, and provide against their devastations; but in countries like our own, where all the vicissitudes of seasons may take place in the course of a few hours, it is of the highest consequence to investigate the nature of the change, and the circumstances that precede or accompany it. To the farmer, the mariner, the traveller, the physician, meteorology is in some measure a study of necessity; to the philosopher it is a study of interest and delight; and to the observer of nature it affords objects of grandeur and sublimity not to be found in any other department of his favourite science. Surely nothing can contribute more to elevate the mind of man, to raise it \"from nature up to nature's God,\" than the contemplation of the sweeping whirlwind, the dazzling lightning, or the awful thunder.\n\nOur limits will not admit of our entering into a historical detail of the progress of meteorology; but it may be proper in this place to enumerate the principal writers on this science both in our own country and on the continent.\n\nIn this country, we may reckon Dr Kirwan, (in his \"Estimate of the Temperature of different Climates,\"\n\nhis \"Essay on the Variations of the Atmosphere,\" and Introduction in the \"Irish Transactions\"), Mr John Dalton (chiefly in the \"Manchester Memoirs\"), Col. Capper (in his \"Observations on the Winds and Monsoons\"), Mr Writers on Williams (in his \"Climate of Great Britain\"), and meteorologist Luke Howard (in the Philosophical Magazine), as the principal cultivators of meteorological knowledge; and on the continent, the names of Cotte (\"Traite de Meteorologie,\" and Journal de Physique), Saussure (\"Essai sur l'Hygrometrie,\" and Voyage aux Alpes\"), De Luc (a) (\"Recherches sur les Modifications de l'Atmosphere,\" Idees sur la Meteorologie,\" and other works), and Lamarck (See Journ. de Phys. pafifim) stand most conspicuous in this branch of natural science.\n\nIn considering the subject of meteorology, we may properly divide it into seven general heads: 1. of the changes which take place in the gravity of the air; 2. of the changes of the temperature of the air; 3. of the changes produced by evaporation and rain; 4. of the changes produced by winds; 5. of atmospherical electricity; 6. of meteors or those visible phenomena accompanied with light, which take place in the atmosphere or near the surface of the earth; and 7. the application of the principles of meteorology to the useful purposes of life. Of these heads, the fifth has been already fully considered under Electricity, and much of the sixth has been exhausted under Meteorolite. The remaining circumstances will form the subjects of the following chapters.\n\nCHAP. I. Of the Changes which take place in the Gravity of the Air.\n\nMany of the facts relating to this part of our subject have been already anticipated under the article Barometer, and several circumstances fall to be considered more properly under Pneumatics than in this place. We shall here confine ourselves to a general view of the changes in the gravity of the atmosphere, as indicated by the barometer, in various situations on or near the surface of the earth, and briefly examine the conclusions that may be drawn from them.\n\nThe most general fact indicated by the barometer is, that this instrument shows us the weight of a column of air high at the level of the sea,\n\n(A) In again mentioning the name of a philosopher so respectable as M. de Luc, we embrace the first opportunity of doing him justice, and of vindicating his character against an unfortunate misconception of the late Professor Robison, a mistake which we have inadvertently contributed to disseminate, by quoting Dr Robison's statement in our account of Dr Black, where M. de Luc is accused of having arrogated to himself Dr Black's discovery of latent heat.\n\nM. de Luc's vindication of himself (as printed in the 12th number of the Edinburgh Review) is before the public. We owe it to candour and justice to acknowledge our conviction that Dr Robison was too hasty in his assertion, and that M. de Luc, so far from arrogating to himself the doctrine of latent heat, has, in various parts of his numerous writings, expressly mentioned Dr Black as the author of that doctrine. This will appear from the following citations. In his \"Introduction \u00e0 la Physique terrestre,\" p. 102, M. de Luc thus expresses himself.\n\n\"Ne connoissant point le feu latent, dans la vapeur \u00e0 toute temp\u00e9rature, dont la premi\u00e8re d\u00e9couverte est due au Dr Black, &c. Again, p. 232 of the same work. \"Ce qui d\u00e9veloppe l'id\u00e9e de chaleur latente par laquelle le Dr Black avoue d\u00e9gager ce ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne,\"\u2014and at p. 385, \"Le Dr Black ayant d\u00e9couvert qu'une certaine quantit\u00e9 de chaleur dispara\u00eet quand la vapeur de l'eau bouillante se forme, nomma ce ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne chaleur latente dans la vapeur.\"\n\nWe trust that these quotations, with M. de Luc's own justification of himself above referred to, will be sufficient to exculpate him from the charge of literary felony so warmly brought against him by Professor Robison; and we have no doubt the Professor himself, were he still alive, would under such evidence retract his accusation.\nGravity of air whose base is equal to the diameter of the mercury in the tube, and whose height is equal to the extent of the atmosphere above the place of observation. As the height of this column must vary in different situations, and must, ceteris paribus, be greatest, at the level of the sea, the mercury in the tube will, under the same circumstances, stand highest in such a situation.\n\nThe medium height of the barometer at the level of the sea is 30 inches, as has been found by observations in the British channel, and in the Mediterranean sea, at the temperatures of 54\u00b0 and 60\u00b0; on the coast of Peru at the temperature of 84\u00b0, and in latitude 89\u00b0.\n\nAs we ascend above the surface of the earth, the medium height of the mercury diminishes; and some late observations made in balloons at a considerable distance above the tops of the highest mountains, have shewn that in the higher regions of the air, the column of mercury is very considerably shortened. This fact, as we have seen (see Barometer), has been usefully applied to the measuring of heights and depths that cannot be ascertained by the usual geometrical methods.\n\nAs the absolute gravity of the atmosphere is constantly varying, even in the same place, the column of air pressing on the surface of the mercury without the tube, must press with more or less force, in proportion as these changes are greater; and hence the barometer points out these variations, falling when the atmosphere is lighter, and rising when it is heavier than usual.\n\nFor an account of the observations that were made on the rise and fall of the barometer by the earlier philosophers, and the attempts which were made by them to explain these phenomena, see Barometer.\n\nIt will be of advantage here to consider the variations of the barometer, as they take place in different situations, in order, if possible, to point out the cause by which these variations are produced, as this cause must have considerable influence on the changes of the weather.\n\nIt is found, that between the tropics the variations of the barometer are exceedingly small, and it is remarkable, that in that part of the world it does not descend above half as much for every 200 feet of elevation as it does beyond the tropics*. In the torrid zone, too, the barometer is elevated about \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of a line twice every day; and this elevation happens at the same time with the tides of the sea\u2020.\n\nAs the latitude advances towards the poles, the range of the barometer gradually increases, till at last it amounts to two or three inches. This gradual increase will appear from the following table.\n\n| Latitude | Places     | Range of the Barometer |\n|----------|------------|------------------------|\n| 6\u00b0       | Peru       | Greatest: 0.20         |\n| 22\u00b0      | Calcutta   | 0.77                   |\n| 40\u00b0      | Naples     | 1.00                   |\n| 51\u00b0      | Dover      | 2.47                   |\n| 53\u00b0      | Middlewick | 3.00                   |\n| 53\u00b0      | Liverpool  | 2.89                   |\n| 59\u00b0      | Pittsburgh | 3.43                   |\n\nThere is, however, some exception to this general rule, as in North America the range of the barometer is much less than in the corresponding European latitudes.\n\nThe range of the barometer is greater at the level of the sea than on mountains, and in the same degree of latitude the extent of the range is in the inverse ratio of the height of the place above the level of the sea.\n\nIt appears probable that the barometer has a tendency to rise during the day from morning to evening, and that this tendency is greatest between 2 and 9 P.M., the greatest elevation being at this last period. The elevation at 2 differs from that at 9 by \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), while that at 2 differs from the morning elevation only by \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\); and that in certain climates the greatest elevation takes place at 2 o'clock*.\n\nThe range of the barometer is greater in winter than in summer, as appears from some observations made at Kendal during five years; the mean range from October to March being 7.982, and that from April to September being only 5.447\u2020.\n\nWhen the atmosphere is serene and settled the mercury is generally high; and in calm weather, when it is inclined to rain, the mercury is low. On the approach of high winds it sinks, as it does with a southerly wind, but rises very high on the approach of easterly and northerly winds. It is found, however, that at Calcutta the mercury is highest with north-westerly and northerly, and lowest with south-easterly winds.\n\nThe mercury suddenly falls on the approach of tempests, and during their continuance undergoes great oscillations.\n\nTo these general facts that have been observed on the rise and fall of the barometer, we shall annex the following axioms by M. Cotte:\n\n1. The greatest changes of the barometer commonly take place during clear weather, with a north wind, and the small risings during cloudy, rainy, or windy weather, with a south, or nearly south wind.\n\n2. The state of the mercury changes more in the winter than in the summer months; so that its greatest rising and falling takes place in winter; but its mean elevation is greater in summer than in winter.\n\n3. The changes of the state of the barometer are nearly null at the equator, and become greater the more one removes from it towards the poles.\n\n4. They are more considerable in valleys than on mountains.\n\n5. The more variable the wind, the more changeable the state of the barometer.\n\n6. It is lower at midnight and noon than at other periods of the day; its greatest daily height is towards evening.\n\n7. Between 10 at night and 2 in the morning, and also in the day, the rising and falling of the mercury are less; the contrary is the case between 6 and 10 in the morning and evening.\n\n8. Between 2 and 6 in the morning and evening it rises as often as it falls; but in such a manner that it oftener rises about that time in the winter months, and falls oftener in the summer months.\n\n9. The oscillations are less in summer, greater in winter, and very great at the equinoxes.\n\n10. They\nThey are greater also in the daytime than during the night.\n\n11. The higher the sun rises above the horizon, the less are the oscillations; they increase as he approaches the western side of the horizon, and are exceedingly great when he comes opposite to the eastern part of the horizon.\n\n12. They are, to a certain degree, independent of the changes of temperature.\n\n13. The mercury generally rises between the new and the full moon, and falls between the latter and the new moon.\n\n14. It rises more in the apogee than the perigee; it usually rises between the northern lunifice and the southern, and falls between the southern lunifice and the northern.\n\n15. In general, a comparison of the variations of the mercury with the positions of the moon gives nothing certain; the results of No. 13. and 14. are the most constant.\n\n16. In the neighbourhood of Paris the barometer never continues 24 hours without changing.\n\n17. The barometers in the western districts rise and fall sooner than those in the more eastern.\n\n18. When the sun passes the meridian, the mercury, if falling, continues to fall, and its fall is often hastened.\n\n19. When the mercury at the same period is rising, it falls, remains stationary, or rises more slowly.\n\n20. When the mercury, under the same circumstances, is stationary, it falls, unless before or after it becomes stationary, it has been in the act of rising.\n\n21. The above changes commonly take place between 11 in the morning and 1 in the afternoon, but oftener before than after noon.\n\n22. Before high tides there is almost always a great fall of the mercury; this takes place oftener at the full than the new moon.\n\nSuch is a general view of the variations in the gravity of the air, as far as they have been observed by the barometer; and we shall now endeavour to give some plausible theory of them.\n\nIt is evident that the density of the atmosphere is least at the equator, and greatest at the poles; for at the equator the centrifugal force, the distance from the centre of the earth, and the heat (all of which tend to diminish the density of the air), are at their maximum, while at the poles they are at their minimum.\n\nThe mean height of the barometer at the level of the sea, all over the globe, is 30 inches; the weight of the atmosphere, therefore, is the same all over the globe. This weight depends on the density and height of the air; where the density is greatest, its height must be least; and on the contrary, where its density is least, its height must be greatest. The height of the atmosphere, therefore, must be greatest at the equator, and least at the poles; and it must decrease gradually between the equator and the poles, so that its upper surface will resemble two inclined planes, meeting above the equator their highest part.*\n\nDuring summer, when the sun is in our hemisphere, the mean heat between the equator and the pole does not differ so much as in winter. Hence the rarity of the atmosphere at the pole, and consequently its height, will be increased. The upper surface of the atmosphere, therefore, in the northern hemisphere, will be less inclined; while that of the southern hemisphere, from contrary causes, will be much more inclined. The reverse will take place during our winter.\n\nThe density of the atmosphere depends in a great measure on the pressure of the superincumbent column, and therefore decreases according to the height, as the pressure of the superincumbent column constantly decreases. But the density of the atmosphere in the torrid zone will not decrease so fast as in the temperate and frigid zones, because its column is larger, and because there is a greater proportion of air in the higher part of this column. This accounts for the observation of Mr. Caffon, that the barometer sinks only half as much for every 200 feet of elevation in the torrid as in the temperate zones. The density of the atmosphere at the equator, therefore, though at the surface of the earth it is least, must at a certain height equal, and at a still greater must exceed, the density of the atmosphere in the temperate zones and at the poles.\n\nWe shall presently endeavour to prove, that a quantity of air is constantly ascending at the equator, and mercury is that part of it at least reaches and continues in the highest in er parts of the atmosphere. From the fluidity of air, northern it is evident that it cannot accumulate above the equa-titudes, but must roll down the inclined plane which the upper surface of the atmosphere assumes towards the poles. As the surface of the atmosphere of the northern hemisphere is more inclined during our winter than that of the southern hemisphere, a greater quantity of the equatorial current of air must flow over upon the northern than upon the southern hemisphere; so that the quantity of our atmosphere will be greater during winter than that of the southern hemisphere; but during summer the reverse will take place. Hence the greatest mercurial heights take place during winter, and the range of the barometer is less in summer than in winter.\n\nThe density of the atmosphere is in a great measure regulated by the heat of the place; wherever the cold is greatest, there the density of the atmosphere will be greatest, and its column thickest. High countries, and ranges of lofty mountains, the tops of which are covered with snow the greatest part of the year, must be much colder than other places situated in the same degree of latitude, and consequently the column of air over them much shorter. The current of superior air will linger and accumulate over these places in its passage towards the poles, and thus occasion an irregularity in its motion, which will produce a similar irregularity in the barometer. Such accumulations will be formed over the north-western parts of Asia, and over North America; hence the barometer usually stands higher, and varies less there, than in Europe. Accumulations also are formed upon the Pyrenees, the Alps, the mountains of Africa, Turkey in Europe, Tartary, and Tibet. When these accumulations have gone on for some time, the density of the air becomes too great to be balanced by the surrounding atmosphere; it rushes down on the neighbouring countries, and produces cold winds which raise the barometer. Hence the rise of the barometer which generally attends north-east winds in Europe, as they proceed from accumulations in the north-west of Asia, or about the pole; hence, too, the north-west wind from the mountains of Tibet raises the barometer at Calcutta.\n\n* Irisf. Trans. vol. ii. p. 43; &c.\nWe shall presently endeavour to show, that considerable quantities of air are occasionally destroyed in the north polar regions. When this happens, the atmosphere to the south rushes in to supply the deficiency. Hence south-west winds take place, and the barometer falls.\n\nAs the mean heat of our hemisphere differs in different years, the density of the atmosphere, and consequently the quantity of equatorial air which flows towards the poles, must also be variable. Does this range correspond to the mean annual heat; that is to say, is the range greatest when the heat is least, and least when the heat is greatest? In some years greater accumulations than usual take place in the mountainous parts of the south of Europe and Asia, owing, perhaps, to earlier falls of snow, or to the rays of the sun having been excluded by long-continued fogs. When this takes place, the atmosphere in the polar regions will be proportionally lighter. Hence the prevalence of southerly winds during some winters more than others.\n\nAs the heat in the torrid zone never differs much, the density, and consequently the height, of the atmosphere, will not vary much. Hence the range of the barometer within the tropics is comparatively small; and it increases gradually as we approach the poles, because the difference of the temperature, and consequently of the density, of the atmosphere, increases with the latitude.\n\nThe diurnal elevation of the barometer in the torrid zone corresponding to the tides, observed by Mr Caffon and others, must be owing to the influence of the moon on the atmosphere. This influence, notwithstanding the ingenious attempts of D'Alembert and several other philosophers, seems altogether inadequate to account for the various phenomena of the winds. It is not so easy to account for the tendency which the barometer has to rise as the day advances. Perhaps it may be accounted for by the additional quantity of vapour added to the atmosphere, which, by increasing the quantity of the atmosphere, may possibly be adequate to produce the effect.\n\nThe falls of the barometer which precede, and the oscillations which accompany, violent storms and hurricanes, show us that these phenomena are produced by very great rarefactions, or perhaps deflections of air, in particular parts of the atmosphere. The falls of the barometer, too, that accompany winds proceed from the same cause. The observation made by Mr Copeland, that a high barometer is accompanied by a temperature above the mean, will be easily accounted for by every one acquainted with Dr Black's theory of latent heat. The higher the mercury stands, the denser the atmosphere must be; and the denser it becomes, the more latent heat it must give out. It is well known that air evolves heat when condensed artificially. The falling of the barometer, which generally precedes rain, remains still to be accounted for; but we know too little about the causes by which rain is produced, to be able to account for it in a satisfactory manner.\n\nIt has been for some time suspected that the variation of the barometer is affected by the changes of the moon. The theory of lunar influence has been discussed on the continent chiefly by Lamarck and Cotte, (see Journal de Physique, p. 179); and in this country by Mr Luke Howard. Mr Howard's suspicions of this influence on the barometer were first conceived, in consequence of the printed charts, of which he made use in keeping a register of the barometer, having the phases of the moon marked on them, and of his observing a remarkable coincidence between these and certain states of the mercury. This coincidence consists in the depression of the barometrical line on the approach of the new and full moon, and its elevation on that of the quarters. In above 30 out of the 50 lunar weeks in the year 1798, the barometer was found to have changed its general direction once in each week, in such a manner as to be either rising or at its maximum, for the week preceding and following, about the time of each quarter; and to be either falling or at its minimum, for the two weeks, about the new and full. It is remarkable, that the point of greatest depression during the year, viz. to 28.67, was found about 12 hours after the new moon on the 8th of November; and that at its greatest and extraordinary elevation to 30.89, on the 7th of February, at the time of the last quarter. Moreover, this coincidence appeared to take place most regularly in fair and moderate weather; and, in general, when the barometer fell, during the interval between the new or full moon and the quarters, an evident perturbation in the atmosphere accompanied it; which may be inferred February 15 to 23, when the barometer, after an uncommon rise, continued to fall rapidly after the new moon, with severe cold, which ended suddenly in stormy and wet weather; again, June 14 to 20, when two weeks of fair weather ended in a thunderstorm. In the greater part of December the usual coincidence disappeared, and the converse took place; the barometer being low at the quarter and high at the full, amidst continual alternations of rain, frost, and snow, and, for part of the time, high winds. On the two days preceding the last quarter, the barometer rose rapidly, and rain followed.\n\nOn the whole, Mr Howard thought there appeared sufficient ground, on the evidence of the year 1798, to suppose that the gravity of our atmosphere, as indicated by the barometer, may be subject to certain periodical changes, effected by a cause more steady and regular than either change of temperature, currents, or solution and precipitation of water, to which he believes the whole variation has been heretofore attributed.\n\nThe mean of the register at large appeared to be 29.89, whence it appears that the depression at the new and full moon either amounted to more, on the whole, than the elevations at the quarters, or that they fell out nearer to the time. He was quite satisfied, in passing through this register, that if he had allowed himself to choose the higher rotations about the quarters, and the lower about the new and full, with a latitude of 24 or 36 hours, it would have made the results as much more favourable to his conclusions as in her former case.\n\nNow, to omit the consideration of other proofs for the present, it appeared to him evident, that the atmosphere is subject to a periodical change of gravity, whereby the barometer, on a mean of ten years, is depressed at least one-tenth of an inch while the moon is passing from the quarters to the full and new; and elevated, in the same proportion, during the return to the quarter. To what causes shall we attribute this periodical change, other than the attraction of the sun and moon for the matter composing the atmosphere?\n\nThe atmosphere is a gravitating fluid, differing, in a physical\nThough there is a considerable difference in every part of the world between the temperature of the atmosphere in summer and in winter; though in the same season the temperature of almost every day, and even every hour, differs from that which precedes and follows it; though the heat varies continually in the most irregular and seemingly capricious manner\u2014still there is a certain mean temperature in every climate, which the atmosphere has always a tendency to observe, and which it neither exceeds nor comes short of beyond a certain number of degrees. What this temperature is, may be known by taking the mean of tables of observations kept for a number of years; and our knowledge of it must be the more accurate the greater the number of observations is.\n\nThe mean annual temperature is greatest at the equator (or at least a degree or two on the north side of it), and it diminishes gradually towards the poles, where it is least. This diminution takes place in arithmetical progression, or, to speak more properly, the annual temperatures of all the latitudes are arithmetical means between the mean annual temperature of the equator and that of the pole. This was first ascertained by Mr Meyer; and Dr Kirwan improving on Meyer's hint, has calculated in the following table the mean annual temperature of every latitude between the equator and the pole. It must be remarked, however, that this table is calculated only for a particular part of the earth's surface, viz. that part of the Atlantic ocean which lies between the 80\u00b0 of northern, and the 45\u00b0 of southern latitude, extending westward as far as the Gulf stream, and to within a few leagues of the coast of America, and for all that part of the Pacific ocean that reaches from 45\u00b0 of north latitude to 45\u00b0 of south latitude, and extending between the 20th and 275th degree of longitude east from London. This part of the ocean is called by Dr Kirwan the standard, and was best suited to his purpose, as the rest of the ocean is subject to irregularities, which will be noticed presently (d).\n\n| Lat. | Temper. | Lat. | Temper. | Lat. | Temper. | Lat. | Temper. | Lat. | Temper. | Lat. | Temper. |\n|------|---------|------|---------|------|---------|------|---------|------|---------|------|---------|\n| 90   | 31      | 77   | 33.7    | 64   | 41.2    | 51   | 52.4    | 38   | 63.9    | 25   | 74.5    |\n| 89   | 31.24   | 76   | 34.1    | 63   | 41.9    | 50   | 52.9    | 37   | 64.8    | 24   | 75.4    |\n| 88   | 31.10   | 75   | 34.5    | 62   | 42.7    | 49   | 53.8    | 36   | 65.7    | 23   | 75.9    |\n| 87   | 31.14   | 74   | 35.0    | 61   | 43.5    | 48   | 54.7    | 35   | 66.6    | 22   | 76.5    |\n| 86   | 31.2    | 73   | 35.5    | 60   | 44.3    | 47   | 55.6    | 34   | 67.4    | 21   | 77.2    |\n| 85   | 31.4    | 72   | 36.0    | 59   | 45.9    | 46   | 56.4    | 33   | 68.3    | 20   | 77.8    |\n| 84   | 31.5    | 71   | 36.6    | 58   | 45.8    | 45   | 57.5    | 32   | 69.1    | 19   | 78.3    |\n| 83   | 31.7    | 70   | 37.2    | 57   | 46.7    | 44   | 58.4    | 31   | 69.9    | 18   | 78.9    |\n| 82   | 32.0    | 69   | 37.8    | 56   | 47.5    | 43   | 59.4    | 30   | 70.7    | 17   | 79.4    |\n| 81   | 32.2    | 68   | 38.4    | 55   | 48.4    | 42   | 60.3    | 29   | 71.5    | 16   | 80.4    |\n| 80   | 32.6    | 67   | 39.1    | 54   | 49.2    | 41   | 61.2    | 28   | 72.3    | 15   | 80.8    |\n| 79   | 32.9    | 66   | 39.7    | 53   | 50.2    | 40   | 62.0    | 27   | 72.8    | 14   | 81.3    |\n| 78   | 33.2    | 65   | 40.4    | 52   | 51.1    | 39   | 63.0    | 26   | 73.8    | 13   | 81.7    |\n\n(d) In calculating this table, Dr Kirwan proceeded on the following principle. Let the mean annual heat at the equator be $m$ and at the pole $m-n$; put $\\phi$ for any other latitude; the mean annual temperature of that latitude will be $m-n\\times\\sin.\\phi$. If, therefore, the temperature of any two latitudes be known, the value of $m$ and $n$ may be found. Now, the temperature of north latitude 45\u00b0 has been found by the best observations to be 62.1\u00b0, and\nDr Kirwan has also calculated in the following table the mean monthly temperature of the same standard (K).\n\n| Latitude | 80\u00b0 | 79\u00b0 | 78\u00b0 | 77\u00b0 | 76\u00b0 | 75\u00b0 | 74\u00b0 | 73\u00b0 | 72\u00b0 | 71\u00b0 | 70\u00b0 | 69\u00b0 | 68\u00b0 | 67\u00b0 | 66\u00b0 | 65\u00b0 | 64\u00b0 | 63\u00b0 | 62\u00b0 |\n|----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| Jan.     | 22.5| 23. | 23.5| 24. | 24.5| 25. | 25.5| 26. | 26.5| 27. | 27.5| 28. | 28. | 28. | 29. | 30. | 31. |\n| Feb.     | 23. | 23.5| 24. | 24.5| 25. | 25.5| 26. | 26.5| 27. | 27.5| 28. | 28.5| 29. | 30. | 31. | 32. | 33. |\n| March    | 27. | 27.5| 28. | 28.5| 29. | 29.5| 30. | 30.5| 31. | 31.5| 32. | 32.5| 33. | 33.5| 34. | 35. | 36. | 37. |\n| April    | 32.6| 32.9| 33.7| 34.1| 34.5| 35. | 35.5| 36. | 36.5| 37.2| 37.8| 38.4| 39.1| 39.7| 40.4| 41.2| 41.9| 42.7|\n| May      | 36.5| 36.5| 37. | 37.5| 38. | 38.5| 39. | 39.5| 40. | 40.5| 41. | 41.5| 42. | 42.5| 43. | 44. | 45. | 46. |\n| June     | 51. | 51.5| 52. | 52. | 52.5| 53. | 53.5| 54. | 54. | 54.5| 54.5| 55. | 55.5| 55.5| 55.5| 55.5| 56. |\n| July     | 50. | 50.5| 51. | 51. | 51.5| 52. | 52.5| 53. | 53.5| 54. | 54.5| 54.5| 55. | 55.5| 55.5| 55.5| 55.5| 56. |\n| Aug.     | 39.5| 40. | 41. | 41.5| 42. | 42.5| 43. | 43.5| 44. | 44.5| 45. | 45.5| 46. | 46. | 47. | 48. | 48.5| 49. |\n| Sept.    | 33.5| 34. | 34.5| 35. | 35.5| 36. | 36.5| 37. | 38. | 38.5| 39. | 39.5| 40. | 40. | 41. | 42. | 43. | 44. |\n| Oct.     | 28.5| 29. | 29.5| 30. | 30.5| 31. | 31.5| 32. | 32.5| 33. | 33.5| 34. | 34. | 35. | 36. | 37. | 37.5| 38. |\n| Nov.     | 23. | 23.5| 24. | 24.5| 25. | 25.5| 26. | 26.5| 27. | 27.5| 28. | 28.5| 29. | 30. | 31. | 32. | 32.5| 33. |\n| Dec.     | 22.5| 23. | 23.5| 24. | 24.5| 25. | 25.5| 26. | 26.5| 27. | 27.5| 28. | 28. | 29. | 30. | 30.5| 31. | 32. |\n\nand that of latitude 50\u00b0, 52.9\u00b0.

From this last equation the value of \\( n \\) is found to be nearly 53; and \\( m \\) is nearly equal to 84. The mean temperature of the equator, therefore, is 84\u00b0, and that of the pole 31\u00b0. To find the mean temperature for every other latitude we have only to find 88 arithmetical means between 84 and 31.\n\n(E.) In calculating the table of mean monthly temperature, Dr Kirwan proceeded on the following principles. The mean temperature of April seems to approach very nearly to the mean temperature of the whole year, and as far as heat depends on the action of the solar rays, the mean heat of each month may be considered as proportional...\nIt appears from the above table that January is the coldest month in every latitude; that July is the warmest month in all latitudes above 48\u00b0; that in lower latitudes August is generally the warmest month; that the difference between the hottest and coldest months increases according to the distance of the place from the equator. All habitable latitudes are found to enjoy a medium heat of 60\u00b0 for at least 2 months, which is a very favourable circumstance, as probably no corn could be produced under a lower medium temperature. The temperatures within 10\u00b0 of the poles differ very little, nor do they differ much within 10\u00b0 of the equator. Hence it was unnecessary to note these latitudes in the table. The temperatures of different years vary but little near the equator, but this difference increases more and more as the latitudes approach the poles.\n\nIt is well known that the temperature of the atmosphere gradually diminishes according to the height of the place above the level of the sea. It was found by Dr Hutton of Edinburgh, that a thermometer kept on the top of Arthur's seat, a height of about 800 feet, usually stood 3\u00b0 lower than one kept at the foot of this hill; and Bouguer observed that on the top of Pinchincha, a height of about 15,564 feet, a thermometer stood 54\u00b0 lower than it did at the level of the sea in the same latitude.\n\nWe are indebted to Dr Kirwan for a very ingenious method of determining the rate of the diminution in the temperature in particular cases, having the temperature of the surface of the earth given. The temperature of the atmosphere constantly diminishing as we rise above the level of the sea, we must at a certain height arrive at a point where a perpetual congelation takes place. This point must vary in height according to the latitude, being highest at the equator, and coming gradually nearer the earth as we approach the poles; it must vary also with the season, being highest in summer, and lowest in winter. The cold on the top of Pinchincha was found by M. Bouguer to extend from 7\u00b0 below the freezing point every morning just before sunrise; hence he concluded that between the tropics the medium height of the term of congelation (where it freezes at some part of the day all the year round) should be fixed at 15,577 feet above the level of the sea; but in latitude 28\u00b0, and during the summer, at 13,440 feet. If we take the difference between the temperature at the equator, and the freezing point, this difference will bear the same proportion to the term of congelation at the equator, that the difference between the medium temperature at any other latitude and the freezing point bears to the term of congelation at that latitude. Suppose the medium heat at the equator to be 84\u00b0, the difference between which and 32\u00b0 is 52\u00b0; and suppose the medium heat of latitude 28\u00b0 to be 72\u00b0, the difference between which and 32\u00b0 is 40\u00b0. Then by the following proportion, \\( \\frac{52}{15577} = \\frac{40}{13440} : \\frac{12}{72} \\), gives us the term of congelation at 28\u00b0. In this way Dr Kirwan proceeded in calculating the following table.\n\n| Lat. | 23\u00b0 | 22\u00b0 | 21\u00b0 | 20\u00b0 | 19\u00b0 | 18\u00b0 | 17\u00b0 | 16\u00b0 | 15\u00b0 | 14\u00b0 | 13\u00b0 | 12\u00b0 | 11\u00b0 | 10\u00b0 |\n|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| Jan. | 68  | 69  | 71  | 72  | 72.5| 73  | 73.5| 74  | 74.5| 75  | 76  | 76.5| 77  | 77.5|\n| Feb. | 72  | 72.5| 74  | 75  | 76  | 76.5| 77  | 77.5| 78  | 78.5| 79  | 79.5| 79.5| 79.5|\n| March| 75  | 75.5| 76  | 77  | 77.5| 78  | 78.5| 79  | 79.5| 80  | 80.5| 81  | 81.5| 81.8|\n| April| 78.5| 79  | 79.5| 80  | 80.5| 81  | 81.5| 82  | 82.5| 83  | 83.5| 84  | 84.5| 84.8|\n| May  | 78.5| 79  | 79.5| 80  | 80.5| 81  | 81.5| 82  | 82.5| 83  | 83.5| 84  | 84.5| 84.8|\n| June | 79  | 79.5| 80  | 80.5| 81  | 81.5| 82  | 82.5| 83  | 83.5| 84  | 84.5| 84.8| 84.8|\n| July | 79  | 79.5| 80  | 80.5| 81  | 81.5| 82  | 82.5| 83  | 83.5| 84  | 84.5| 84.8| 84.8|\n| Aug. | 79  | 79.5| 80  | 80.5| 81  | 81.5| 82  | 82.5| 83  | 83.5| 84  | 84.5| 84.8| 84.8|\n| Sept.| 78.5| 79  | 79.5| 80  | 81  | 81.5| 82  | 82.5| 83  | 83.5| 84  | 84.5| 84.8| 84.8|\n| Oct. | 75  | 75.5| 77  | 78  | 79  | 80  | 81  | 81.5| 82  | 82.5| 83  | 83.5| 84  | 84.8|\n| Nov. | 74  | 74.5| 75  | 75.5| 76  | 77  | 78  | 78.5| 79  | 79.5| 80  | 80.5| 80.8| 81  |\n| Dec. | 71  | 71.5| 72  | 72.5| 73  | 74  | 75  | 75.5| 76  | 76.5| 77  | 77.5| 78  | 78.5|\n\nAs the fine of the sun\u2019s mean altitude in April : the mean heat of April = the fine of the sun\u2019s mean altitude in May : mean heat of May.\n\nIn the same manner the mean heat of June, July, and August may be found; but for the temperature of the succeeding months we must take into consideration another circumstance, since the above rule would make the temperature of these months too low, as it does not take in the heat derived from the earth, which is nearly equal to the mean annual temperature. The real mean heats of these months must be considered as an arithmetical mean between the astronomical and terrestrial heats. Thus, for latitude 51\u00b0, the astronomical heat of September being 44.6\u00b0, and the mean annual heat 52.4\u00b0, the real heat of September ought to be \\( \\frac{44.6 + 52.4}{2} = 48.5 \\). Dr Kirwan, however, after going through a tedious calculation, found the results to correspond so little with actual observation, that he drew up the table partly from calculating from principles, and partly from an examination of several sea journals.\nThis last height of 120 feet M. Bouguer called the lower term of congelation. He also distinguished another term of congelation above which no visible vapour rises, and this he called the upper term of congelation. This line is considered by Kirwan as much less variable during the summer months than the lower line, and it has therefore been adopted by him to determine the rate of diminution in the temperature as we ascend into the atmosphere. He has calculated its height for every degree of north latitude in the following table.\n\n| N. Lat. | Feet | N. Lat. | Feet | N. Lat. | Feet | N.

Part II.\n\n(f) Dr Kirwan has given us the following rule for ascertaining the temperature at any required height, supposing we know the temperature of the surface of the earth.\n\nFor the temperature observed at the surface of the earth, put \\( m \\); for the given height \\( h \\), and \\( t \\) for the height of the upper term of congelation at the given latitude; then\n\n\\[\n\\frac{m - 32}{t} = \\text{the diminution of temperature for every 100 feet of elevation; or it is the common difference of the terms of the progression required.}\n\\]\n\nLet this common difference thus found be denoted by \\( c \\); then \\( c \\times \\frac{h}{100} \\) gives us the whole diminution of temperature from the surface of the earth to the given height. Let this diminution be denoted by \\( d \\), then \\( m - d \\) is obviously the\nM E T E O R O L O G Y.\n\n7. Moisture has a peculiar influence on it, if followed by a wind which disperses it.\n\n8. The greatest heat, and the greatest cold, take place about six weeks after the northern or southern solstice.\n\n9. The thermometer changes more in summer than in winter.\n\n10. The coldest period of the day is before sunrise.\n\n11. The greatest heat in the sun and the shade seldom takes place on the same day.\n\n12. The heat decreases with far more rapidity from September and October, than it increased from July to September.\n\n13. It is not true, that a very cold winter is the prognostic of a very hot summer.\n\nCHAP. III. Of the Changes which take place in the Air with respect to Evaporation and Rain.\n\nThere seems no reason to doubt that water exists in Qualities of the atmosphere in an intermediate state between that of vapour, a fluid and that of absolute steam. This is the state of vapour, of the qualities of which it is proper that we should here take a general view.\n\nWe are indebted to the experiments of Saussure and de Luc for much of our knowledge of the qualities of vapour. It is an elastic invisible fluid like common air, but lighter; being to common air, according to Saussure, as 10 to 14, or, according to Kirwan, as 10 to 12; it cannot pass beyond a certain maximum of density, otherwise the particles of water which compose it unite together, and form small, hollow, visible vehicles, called vesicular vapour; which is of the same specific gravity with atmospheric air. It is of this vapour that clouds and fogs are composed. This maximum increases with the temperature; and at the heat of boiling water is so great, that steam can resist the whole pressure of the air, and exist in the atmosphere in any quantity.\n\nAfter what has been stated under Chemistry with respect to the nature and properties of vapour, we have nothing here to add on that subject, except to give the result of observations that have been made on the state of vapour in the atmosphere.\n\nIt is found that the evaporation of water into the air Evaporation is confined entirely to the surface, and hence it is always proportional to the surface exposed to the action of the air. Accordingly, observation shows that in maritime countries, and in marshy situations, in the neighbourhood of lakes, rivers, &c., the evaporation is much greater than in inland countries, and dry situations.\n\nIt is found that evaporation is greatest in hot weather; Proportionally to the temperature of the air, whence it must depend, in some degree, on the temperature of the air.\n\nthe temperature required. An example will make this rule sufficiently obvious. In latitude 56\u00b0 the heat below being 54\u00b0; required the temperature of the air at the height of 803 feet?\n\nHere \\( m = 54, t = 5533, \\frac{m - 32}{t} = \\frac{22}{54.33} = 0.404 = c \\), and \\( c \\times \\frac{h}{100} = 0.404 \\times 8.03 = 3.24 = d \\), and \\( m - d = 54 - 3.24 = 50.75 \\). Hence we see that the temperature of the air at the height of 803 feet above the surface is 50\u00b0.75.\nEvaporation and Rain.\n\nThis was ascertained by Mr Dalton from actual experiments, the result of which was, that the quantity evaporated per minute from a given surface of water at a given temperature, is to the quantity evaporated from the surface at $212^\\circ$, as the force of vapour at the given temperature is to the force of vapour at $212^\\circ$. By means of the table expressing the force of vapour at various temperatures given under Chemistry, p. 468, we may discover by the above rule the quantity of water at a given temperature lost by evaporation.\n\nThere are several circumstances that affect the quantity of vapour rising from water, even at the same temperature. Thus, we find that evaporation is least in calm weather, increases when there is wind, and is greater in proportion as the wind is stronger. This evidently arises from the agitation of the water, by which a new surface is perpetually exposed to the action of the air.\n\nWe shall here insert a table by Mr Dalton, expressing the quantity of vapour raised in various atmospheric temperatures, from a circular surface six inches in diameter.\n\n| Temperature | Force of vapour in inches | Evaporating force in grains |\n|-------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|\n| $212^\\circ$ |                          |                            |\n| 30          | .129                     | .52                        |\n| 120         | .67                      | .82                        |\n| 154         | .85                      |                            |\n| 189         | .54                      |                            |\n| 20          | .134                     | .56                        |\n| 21          | .71                      | .88                        |\n| 22          | .91                      |                            |\n| 23          | .73                      |                            |\n| 24          | .94                      |                            |\n| 25          | .79                      |                            |\n| 26          | .97                      |                            |\n| 27          | .82                      |                            |\n| 28          | .86                      |                            |\n| 29          | .90                      |                            |\n| 30          | .93                      |                            |\n| 31          | .99                      |                            |\n| 32          | .93                      |                            |\n| 33          | .97                      |                            |\n| 34          | .91                      |                            |\n| 35          | .95                      |                            |\n| 36          | .98                      |                            |\n| 37          | .92                      |                            |\n| 38          | .95                      |                            |\n| 39          | .98                      |                            |\n| 40          | .92                      |                            |\n| 41          | .95                      |                            |\n| 42          | .98                      |                            |\n| 43          | .92                      |                            |\n| 44          | .95                      |                            |\n| 45          | .98                      |                            |\n| 46          | .92                      |                            |\n| 47          | .95                      |                            |\n| 48          | .98                      |                            |\n| 49          | .92                      |                            |\n| 50          | .95                      |                            |\n| 51          | .98                      |                            |\n| 52          | .92                      |                            |\n\nThe first column of the above table expresses the temperature; the second, the corresponding force of vapour; the other three columns give the number of grains of water that would be evaporated from a surface of six inches in diameter in the respective temperatures, on the supposition of there being previously no aqueous vapour in the atmosphere. These columns present the extremes and the mean of evaporation likely to be noticed, or nearly such; for the first is calculated upon the supposition of 35 grains lost per minute from the vessel of three inches and a quarter in diameter; the second 45, and the third 55 grains per minute.\n\nAs yet we have stated only the degree of evaporation that would take place under various circumstances, provided that the atmosphere were, at the time, entirely free from moisture; but as this can scarcely happen, it becomes necessary to ascertain the rate of evaporation when qualified by the vapour already existing in the atmosphere. This is readily done by first finding the force of the vapour already in the atmosphere, as above directed, and subtracting it from the force of vapour at the given temperature. The remainder is the actual force of evaporation, from which, by the last table, we find the required rate of evaporation.\nEvaporation and Rain.\n\nSuppose, for instance, it be required to know the rate of evaporation at the temperature of 59\u00b0. From the last table we see that the force of vapour at 59\u00b0 is about 0.5 or \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) its force at 212\u00b0. Now, suppose that by trials we find the force of the vapour which already exists in the atmosphere to be 0.25 or \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\). Subtracting the latter from the former, we have for a remainder 0.25\u2014the force of evaporation required, which is therefore just the half of what it would be if the atmosphere were entirely free from vapour.\n\nThe force of vapour existing in the atmosphere is scarcely ever equal to the force of vapour of the temperature of the atmosphere. Hence evaporation may, with a few exceptions, be considered as going on without intermission. Attempts have been made to ascertain the quantity of evaporation that takes place in the course of a year; but the investigation of this problem is so difficult, that these attempts have succeeded only in obtaining approximations towards the truth. Mr Dobson of Liverpool, from a course of experiments made in 1772, 1773, 1774, and 1775, concludes that the mean annual evaporation from the surface of water, amounted to 36.78 inches. The proportions for each month are as follows:\n\n| Month   | Inches |\n|---------|--------|\n| January | 1.50   |\n| February| 1.77   |\n| March   | 2.04   |\n| April   | 3.30   |\n| May     | 4.34   |\n| June    | 4.41   |\n| July    | 5.11   |\n| August  | 5.01   |\n| September| 3.18 |\n| October | 2.51   |\n| November| 1.51   |\n| December| 1.49   |\n\nThe experiments of Mr Dalton shew that the evaporation from the surface of water in a very dry and hot summer day, was rather more than two tenths of an inch.\n\nSeveral experiments have been made on the quantity of evaporation from land, especially by Mr Williams in America, and Dr Watson, Mr Dalton and Mr Hoyle in Britain.\n\nMr Williams's experiments appear to show that the evaporation from the surface of such land as is covered with trees and other vegetables is about one third greater than the evaporation from the surface of water, though much reliance is not laid on these experiments.\n\nFrom an experiment made by Dr Watson during the summer, when the earth had been parched by a month's drought, it appeared that 1600 gallons of water were evaporated from a single acre in 12 hours. Dr Watson's experiment, however, was of a nature that did not admit of great precision.\n\nThe experiments made by Mr Dalton and Mr Hoyle in the years 1796, 1797, and 1798, are the most exact that have been made on this subject, and we shall therefore consider them more at large. They were made with the following apparatus. Having procured a cylindrical vessel made of tin plate, three feet deep and ten inches in diameter, they inserted into it two pipes directed downwards, so that water might pass through them into two bottles. One pipe was fixed near the bottom of the vessel, and the other about an inch from the top. The vessel was filled up for a few inches with gravel and sand, and all the rest with good fresh soil. It was then put into a hole in the ground, and the space around filled up with earth except on one side, for the convenience of putting bottles to the two pipes; then some water was poured on the earth to saturate it, and all that would drain off was suffered to escape. Hence the earth may be considered as saturated with moisture. The soil was kept for some weeks above the level of the upper pipe, but after that it was constantly allowed to be a little below it, thus preventing any water from running off through that pipe. The top of the soil for the first year was bare; but for the two last years it was covered with grass like other turf. The apparatus being thus prepared, a correct register was kept of the quantity of rain water which ran off from the surface of the earth by the upper pipe, as long as that was below the earth, and also of the quantity of water which passed through the three feet of earth, and ran off by the lower pipe; and a rain gauge of an equal diameter with the cylinder was kept near it, for the purpose of measuring the quantity of rain which fell in any corresponding time. Then, by subtracting the quantity of water which passed through the pipes from that in the rain gauge, the remainder was considered as equal to the quantity evaporated from the surface of the earth in the cylinder. The mean annual result of these experiments is shown in the following table.\n\n| Water through the two pipes. | Mean. | Mean Rain. | Mean Evap. |\n|-----------------------------|-------|------------|------------|\n| 1796.

On the whole, we may perhaps estimate the mean annual evaporation from the whole surface of the globe at 35 inches from every square inch of surface, making the whole water annually evaporated over the whole globe equal to 94,450 cubic miles.\n\nWere this prodigious mass of water all to subside in the atmosphere at once, it would increase its mass by about \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), and raise the barometer nearly 3 inches. But this never happens, no day passes without rain in some part of the earth; so that part of the evaporated water is continually precipitated again. Indeed it would be impossible for the whole of the evaporated water to subside in the atmosphere at once, at least in the state of vapour.\n\nThe higher regions of the atmosphere contain less vapour than the strata near the surface of the earth. This was observed both by M. de Saussure and M. de Luc.\n\nAt some height above the tops of mountains the atmosphere is probably still drier, for it was observed by Saussure, that on the tops of mountains the moisture of the air was rather less during the night than the day. And there can be little doubt that every stratum of air descends a little lower during the night than it was during the day, owing to the cooling and condensing of the stratum nearest the earth. Vapours, however, must ascend very high, for we see clouds forming far above the tops of the highest mountains.\n\nRain never begins to fall while the air is transparent; the invisible vapours first pass their maximum, and are changed into vesicular vapours; clouds are formed, and these clouds gradually dissolve in rain. Clouds, however, are not formed in all parts of the horizon at once; the formation begins in one particular spot, while the rest of the air remains clear as before; this cloud rapidly increases till it overpreads the whole horizon, and then the rain begins.\n\nIt is remarkable, that though the greatest quantity of vapour exists in the lower strata of the atmosphere, clouds never begin to form there, but always at some considerable height. It is remarkable too, that the part of the atmosphere at which they form has not arrived at the point of extreme moisture, nor near that point, even a moment before their formation. They are not formed then because a greater quantity of vapour had got into the atmosphere than could remain there without passing its maximum. It is still more remarkable, that when clouds are formed, the temperature of the spot in which they are formed is not always lowered, though this may sometimes be the case. On the contrary, the heat of the clouds themselves is sometimes greater than that of the surrounding air*. Nor is the formation of clouds owing to the capacity of air for combining with moisture being lessened by cold; so far from that, we often see clouds which had remained in the atmosphere during the heat of the day, disappear in the night, after the heat of the air was diminished.\n\nThe formation of clouds and rain cannot be accounted for by a single principle with which we are acquainted. It is neither owing to the saturation of the atmosphere, nor the diminution of the heat; nor the mixture of airs of different temperatures, as Dr Hutton supposes; for clouds are often formed without any wind at all either above or below them; and even if this mixture constantly took place, the precipitation, instead of accounting for rain, would be almost imperceptible.\n\nIt is a very remarkable fact, that evaporation often goes on for a month together in hot weather without any rain. This sometimes happens in this country; it happens every year in the torrid zone. Thus at Calcutta, during January 1785, it never rained at all; the mean of the thermometer for the whole month was 66\u00b0; there was no high wind, and indeed during great part of the month little wind at all.\n\nThe quantity of water evaporated during such a drought must be very great; yet the moisture of the air, instead of being increased, is constantly diminishing, and at last disappears almost entirely. For the dew, which is at first copious, diminishes every night; and if Dr Watson's experiment formerly mentioned be attended to, it will not be objected that the quantity of evaporation is also very much diminished. Of the very dry state to which the atmosphere is reduced during long droughts, the violent thunderstorms with which they often conclude is a very decisive proof. Now what becomes of all this moisture? It is not accumulated in the atmosphere above the country from which it was evaporated, otherwise the whole atmosphere would in a much less period than a month be perfectly saturated with moisture. If it be carried up daily through the different strata of the atmosphere, and wafted to other regions by superior currents of air, how is it possible to account for the different electrical state of the clouds situated between different strata, which often produces the most violent thunderstorms? They could not have remained in the lower strata of the atmosphere, and been daily carried off by winds to other countries; for there are often no winds at all during several days to perform this office; nor in that case would the dews diminish, nor could their presence fail to be indicated by the hygrometer.\n\nIt is impossible for us to account for this remarkable fact upon any principle with which we are acquainted. The water can neither remain in the atmosphere, nor pass through it in the state of vapour. It must therefore assume some other form; but what that form is, or how it assumes it, we know not. There are, therefore, two steps of the process which takes place between evaporation and rain, with which we are entirely unacquainted; first, the state of the vapour after it enters into the atmosphere, and second, the cause by which it is made to lay aside the new form which it assumed, return to its state of vapour, and descend in form of rain. Several theories have been contrived to account for this phenomenon, but they are all untenable on the present known laws of chemical action.\n\nThe mean annual quantity of rain is greatest at the equator, and decreases gradually as we approach the poles. Thus at Granada, Antilles, 12\u00b0 N. Lat. it is 126 inches.\n\n| Location          | Latitude | Rainfall |\n|-------------------|----------|----------|\n| Cape Fran\u00e7ois     | 19\u00b0      | 46\"     |\n| St Domingo        | 19\u00b0      | 46\"     |\n| Calcutta          | 22\u00b0      | 23\"     |\n| Rome              | 41\u00b0      | 54\"     |\n| England           | 33\u00b0      | 0\"      |\n| Peterburgh        | 59\u00b0      | 16\"     |\n\n* De Luc la Meteorol. vol. ii. 100.\nOn the contrary, the number of rainy days is smallest at the equator, and increases in proportion to the distance from it. From N. Lat. 12\u00b0 to 43\u00b0 the mean number of rainy days is 78; from 43\u00b0 to 46\u00b0 the mean number is 102; from 46\u00b0 to 50\u00b0 it is 134; from 50\u00b0 to 60\u00b0, 161 days.\n\nThe number of rainy days is often greater in winter than in summer; but the quantity of rain is greater in summer than in winter. At Peterburgh, the number of rainy or snowy days during winter is 84, and the quantity which falls is only about 5 inches; during summer the number of rainy days is nearly the same, but the quantity which falls is about 11 inches.\n\nMore rain falls in mountainous countries than in plains. Among the Andes it is said to rain almost perpetually, while in Egypt it scarcely ever rains at all. If a rain-gauge be placed on the ground, and another at some height perpendicularly above it, more rain will be collected into the lower than into the higher; a proof that the quantity of rain increases as it descends, owing perhaps to the drops attracting vapour during their passage through the lower strata of the atmosphere where the greatest quantity resides. This, however, is not always the case, as Mr Copland of Dumfries discovered in the course of his experiments. He observed also, that when the quantity of rain collected in the lower gage was greatest, the rain commonly continued for some time; and that the greatest quantity was collected in the higher gage only either at the end of great rains, or during rains which did not last long. These observations are important, and may, if followed out, give us new knowledge of the causes of rain. They seem to show, that during rain the atmosphere is somehow or other brought into a state which induces it to part with its moisture; and that the rain continues as long as this state continues. Were a sufficient number of observations made on this subject in different places, and were the atmosphere carefully analysed during dry weather, during rain, and immediately after rain, we might soon perhaps discover the true theory of rain.\n\nRain falls in all seasons of the year, at all times of the day, and during the night as well as the day; though, according to M. Toaldo, a greater quantity falls during the day than the night. The cause of rain, then, whatever it may be, must be something which operates at all times and seasons. Rain falls also during the continuance of every wind, but oftener when the wind blows from the south. Falls of rain often happen likewise during perfect calms.\n\nIt appears from a paper published by M. Cotte in the Journal de Physique for October 1791, containing the mean quantity of rain falling at 147 places, situated between N. Lat. 11\u00b0 and 65\u00b0, deduced from tables kept at these places, that the mean annual quantity of rain falling in all these places is 34.7 inches. Let us suppose then (which cannot be very far from the truth), that the mean annual quantity of rain for the whole is 34 inches. The superficies of the globe consists of $170,081,012$ square miles, or $686,401,498,471,475,200$ square inches. The quantity of rain therefore falling annually will amount to $23,337,650,812,030,156,800$ cubic inches, or somewhat more than $91,751$ cubic miles of water. This is $16,191$ cubic miles of water less than the quantity of water evaporated. It seems probable therefore, if the imperfection of our data warrant any conclusion, that some of the vapour is actually decomposed in the atmosphere, and converted into oxygen and hydrogen gas.\n\nThe dry land amounts to $52,745,253$ square miles; the quantity of rain falling on it annually will amount to $30,960$ cubic miles. The quantity of water running annually into the sea is $13,140$ cubic miles; a quantity of water equal to which must be supplied by evaporation from the sea, otherwise the land would soon be completely drained of its moisture.\n\nThe quantity of rain falling annually in Great Britain may be seen from the following table.\n\n| Years of observation | Places                  | Rain in Inches |\n|----------------------|-------------------------|----------------|\n| 3                    | Dover                   | 37.52          |\n| 5                    | Ware, Hertfordshire     | 23.6           |\n| 8                    | London                  | 17.5           |\n| 8                    | Kimbolton               | 25.9           |\n| 45                   | Lyndon                  | 22.21          |\n| 5                    | Chatsworth, Derbyshire  | 27.865         |\n| 8                    | Manchester              | 43.1           |\n| 18                   | Liverpool               | 34.41          |\n| 7                    | Lancaster               | 40.3           |\n| 5                    | Kendal                  | 61.225         |\n| 14                   | Dumfries                | 36.127         |\n| 10                   | Berwick                 | 31.26          |\n| 5                    | Langholm                | 36.73          |\n| 5                    | Dalkeith                | 25.124         |\n| 20                   | Glasgow                 | 31             |\n| 8                    | Hawkhill                | 28.966         |\n|                      | Mean                    | 32.532         |\n\nMr Dalton has estimated the quantity of rain that falls in England at 21 inches; but as no account is taken of what falls in Wales and Scotland, this estimate probably falls much short of the real annual quantity. In this country it generally rains less in March than in November, in the proportion at a medium of 7 to 12. It generally rains less in April than October, in the proportion of 1 to 2 nearly at a medium. It generally rains less in May than September; the chances that it does so are at least at 4 to 3; but when it rains plentifully in May, it generally rains but little in September; and when it rains one inch, or less in May, it rains plentifully in September.\n\nThe degree of moisture that is present in the atmosphere at any given time, is measured by the hygrometer. Under the article Hygrometer we have amply described several of the most important instruments of that kind; but there is one hygrometer, viz. that of Mr Leslie, which remains to be described in this place. Figures of the instrument are given in Plate CCLXXVI. fig. 13, 14.\n\nThe principal part of the instrument is composed of Leslie's hygrostats, two glass tubes terminated by hollow balls, one transparent and the other opaque. The tubes are selected, as regular as possible, from 4 to 8 inches long, and about $\\frac{1}{2}$ of an inch thick, or as slender as those employed for\nfor thermometers, but with a much wider bore. This, in one tube, must be from $\\frac{1}{8}$ to the $\\frac{3}{8}$ of an inch in diameter, and an exact calibre, at least not differing by $\\frac{1}{50}$ between both its extremities. To the end of it a small piece of black enamel is attached, and blown into an opaque ball, from $\\frac{4}{7}$ to $\\frac{1}{2}$ of an inch diameter. The corresponding tube may have its bore of the same, or rather a greater width, but its uniformity is not at all essential. Near the extremity it is swelled out into a thin cylinder, almost $\\frac{1}{8}$ of an inch wide, and from $\\frac{1}{8}$ to $\\frac{6}{8}$ long; the inner cavity only being enlarged, without altering the exterior regularity of the tube. The short bit of glass where this cylinder terminates, is now blown into a thin pellucid ball, as nearly of the size of the former as the eye can judge. The exact equality of the balls would be unattainable, and fortunately the theory of the instrument does not require it. When a dark and a bright object are viewed together, the latter, from an optical deception, appears always larger than the reality; and for this reason, says Mr Leflie, I prefer making the clear ball a slight degree smaller than the black one. In the mean time a coloured liquor is prepared by dissolving carmine in concentrated sulphuric acid, in a phial with a ground stopper, taking care to avoid heat, as by this the colouring-matter would be charred, and the beauty of the liquor destroyed.\n\nThe tubes are now cut to nearly equal lengths, and the end of each swelled cut a little, to facilitate their junction. Close to the black ball, the tube is bent by the flame of a candle into a shoulder, such, that the root of the ball shall come into a line with the inner edge of the tube. This ball, being then warmed, the end of the tube is dipped into the acid liquor, and as much of it allowed to rise and flow into the cavity, as may be guessed sufficient to fill both tubes, excepting the cylinder. The two tubes are then, by the help of a blow-pipe, solidly joined together in one straight piece, without having any knot or protuberance. About half an inch from the joining, and nearer the cylinder, it is gently bent round by the flame of a candle, till the clear ball is brought to touch the tube $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch directly below the black one. The instrument is now to be graduated; and the scale chosen by Mr Leflie is that which corresponds to the centigrade thermometer. Mr Leflie thus describes the mode of graduating the instrument.\u2014The instrument is held in an oblique position, that the coloured liquor may collect at the bottom of the black ball, into which a few minute portions of air may, from time to time, be forced over, by heating the opposite ball with the hand. In this way, the interposed liquid will gradually be made to descend into the tube, and assume its proper place; and it should remain for a week or two in an inclined position, to let every particle drain out of the black ball. If any trace of fluid collects in rings within the bore, they are easily dispelled with a little dexterity and manipulation, which, though it would be difficult to describe, is most readily learnt and practised. The small cavity at the joining facilitates the rectification, by affording the means of sending a globule of air in either direction. In fixing the zero of the scale, Mr Leflie set the instrument in a remote corner of the room, or partly closed the window-shutters. When completely adjusted, the top of the coloured liquor, if held upright, should stand nearly opposite to the middle of the cylindrical reservoir.\n\nIn this state of preparation, the instrument is ready for being graduated. The clear ball and the contiguous part of the parallel tube are therefore covered with two or three folds of thin bibulous paper, moistened with pure water, to make it act as a hygrometer; and there is attached to the same tube a temporary scale, by means of a soft cement composed of bees-wax and rosin. A flat round piece of wood being provided with four or five pillars that screw into it, the instrument is fixed to one of them in an erect position, and on each side is disposed a fine corresponding thermometer, inverted, and at the same height, the one having its bulb covered with wet bibulous paper. Then half a yard of flannel is dried as much as possible without fingering, before a good fire, and rolling it up like a sleeve, it is lapped loosely round the lower part of the pillars, and the whole is inclosed under a large bell-glass. The flannel powerfully absorbs moisture from the confined air, and creates an artificial dryness of 80 or 100 degrees. In the space of a quarter or half an hour, the full effect is produced, and the quantities being noted at two or three separate times, the mean results are adopted. The deficient, measured by the temporary scale, being then augmented in the proportion of ten to the difference of the two thermometers, will give the length that corresponds to 100\u00b0. After the standard instrument is constructed, others are thence graduated with the utmost care; the first being planted in the centre, and the rest, with their temporary scales, stuck to the encircling pillars. For greater accuracy, the observation should be made in a room without a fire, or a screen ought to be interposed between the fire and the apparatus.\n\nThe slips of ivory intended for the scales are divided into equal parts, and should contain from 100\u00b0 to 150\u00b0. The edges are filed down and chamfered, to fit easily between the parallel tubes; and they are secured in their place by a strong solution of sizingglass. The lower ball and its annexed cylinder, are covered with thin silk of the same colour as the upper ball, and a few threads are likewise lapped about that part of the tube which it touches. The instrument is lastly cemented into a piece of wood, either end of which admits a cylindrical case that serves equally to protect or to hold it. On other occasions, the hygrometer is inserted into the socket of a round bottom-piece where it stands vertical.\n\nThe above description refers particularly to fig. 14. Fig. 13 differs from this, only in having the balls of an equal height, and bended in opposite directions, which Mr Leflie considers as more convenient for some purposes to which the instrument is applied, to be mentioned hereafter, but which renders the instrument less portable.\n\nThe action of this hygrometer depends on the following principle; That the cold produced by evaporation in the instrument will accurately denote the degree of dryness of the air, or its distance from the point of saturation. To discover the dryness or humidity of the air, therefore, we have only to find the change of temperature induced in a body of water inflated, or exposed on all sides to evaporation. The steps which led Mr Leflie from these simple\nsimple principles to the construction of the present ingenious instrument, are detailed by him in a paper published in Nicholson's Journal for January 1800, to which we must refer our readers for the particulars, contenting ourselves with the following summary view.\n\nIf two thermometers be filled with any expandible fluid, and having the bulb of the one wet and the other dry, they will, by their difference, denote the state of the air in respect to humidity. Mr Leflie's object was to combine two such instruments, so that they should indicate merely their difference of temperature; and this object he has completely attained by the present instrument. In ordinary cases, the intermediate liquor would continue stationary; for the air in both balls having the same temperature, and consequently the same elasticity, the opposite pressures would precisely counteract each other; but if, from the action of the external air on the moistened surface, one ball became colder, it is manifest the liquor would be pushed towards it by the superior elasticity of the air included in the other ball, so as to mark, by the space of its approach, the depression of temperature induced by evaporation.\n\nThis instrument does not merely point out the dryness of the air; it enables us to determine the absolute quantity of moisture which it is capable of imbibing; for the conversion of water into steam is found to consume 524\u00b0 of the centigrade division; and evaporation, analogous in its effects, may be presumed to occasion the same waste of heat. If, therefore, air had the same capacity as water, for each degree of the hygrometer it would deposit as much heat as it would abstract by dissolving the $\\frac{1}{3}$ part of its weight of humidity. But the capacity of air is to that of water as 11 to 5, and consequently it would require in that proportion a greater evaporation to produce the same effect. We may hence conclude, that, for each hygrometric degree, the air would require $\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{7}{3} = \\frac{7}{9}$ part by weight of water to effect saturation.\n\nStrictly speaking, the degrees marked by this hygrometer do not measure the dryness of the air at its actual temperature, but only its state of dryness when cooled down to the standard of the wet ball. The law, however, being known of the dissolving power of air as affected by heat, it is easy, from the dissipation of the air with respect to humidity at one temperature to derive that at any other. It will suffice to mention the result of a number of careful experiments:\u2014Supposing air at the freezing point to be capable of holding 50 parts of moisture; at 10\u00b0 centigrade, it will hold 100; at 20\u00b0, 200; at 30\u00b0, 400; thus doubling at each increase of 10\u00b0. Hence a table may be constructed by which these conversions will be easily made.\n\nTo omit nothing that tends to elucidate the theory of the instrument, we must observe that the air in its contact with the humid surface is not absolutely cooled to the same temperature; the air and water really meet each other at an intermediate point determined by their compounded density and capacity. Consequently the indications of the hygrometer ought to be augmented by the $\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{7}{3} = \\frac{7}{9}$ part, or $\\frac{7}{9}$. But this quantity is too small in any case to be regarded.\n\nIn considering the subject of winds, we shall first briefly detail their natural history, so far as it has not been already anticipated, and shall then endeavour to trace the laws by which they are regulated, or explain the manner in which their varieties are produced. As the direction of the winds is of the greatest consequence, especially in a commercial view, we shall first point out the direction of the most prevalent winds in various quarters of the world.\n\nBetween the tropics the winds are the most regular. Trade-winds lie near the equator, there is a regular wind during the whole year called the trade-wind. On the north side of the equator it blows from the north east, varying frequently a point or two towards the north or east; and on the south side of it, from the south-east, changing sometimes in the same manner towards the south or east. The space included between the second and fifth degrees of north latitude is the internal limit of these two winds. There the winds can neither be said to blow from the north nor the south; calms and violent storms are frequent. This space varies a little in latitude as the sun approaches either of the tropics. In the Atlantic ocean the trade winds extend farther north on the American than on the African coast; and as we advance westward, they become gradually more easterly, and decrease in strength. Their force diminishes likewise as we approach their utmost boundaries. It has been remarked also, that as the sun approaches the tropic of cancer, the south-east winds become gradually more southerly, and the north-east winds more easterly; exactly the contrary takes place when the sun is approaching the tropic of capricorn.\n\nThe trade-wind blows constantly in the Indian ocean from 10\u00b0 south latitude to near 30\u00b0; but to the northward of this the winds change every six months, and blow directly opposite to their former course. These regular winds are called monsoons, from the Malay word moolin, which signifies a season. When they shift their direction, variable winds and violent storms succeed, which last for a month, and frequently longer; and during that time it is dangerous for vessels to continue at sea.\n\nThe monsoons in the Indian ocean may be reduced to two; one on the north and another on the south side of the equator; which extend from Africa to the longitude of New Holland and the east coast of China, and which suffer partial changes in particular places from the situation and influence of the neighbouring countries.\n\nBetween 3\u00b0 and 10\u00b0 of south latitude the south-east trade-wind continues from April to October; but during the rest of the year the wind blows from the north-west. Between Sumatra and New Holland this monsoon blows from the south during our summer months, approaching gradually to the south-east as we advance towards the coast of New Holland; it changes about the end of September, and continues in the opposite direction till April. Between Africa and Madagascar its direction is influenced by the coast; for it blows\nWinds blow from the north-east from October to April, and during the rest of the year from the south-west.\n\nOver all the Indian ocean to the northward of the third degree of south latitude, the north-east trade-wind blows from October to April, and a south-west wind from April to October. From Borneo, along the coast of Malacca, and as far as China, this monsoon in summer blows nearly from the south, and in winter from the north by east. Near the coast of Africa, between Mozambique and Cape Guardafui, the winds are irregular during the whole year, owing to the different monsoons which surround that particular place. Monsoons are likewise regular in the Red sea; between April and October they blow from the north-west, and during the other months from the south-east, keeping constantly parallel to the coast of Arabia.\n\nMonsoons are not altogether confined to the Indian ocean; on the coast of Brazil, between Cape St Augustine and the island of St Catharine, the wind blows between September and April from the east or north-east, and between April and September from the south-west. The bay of Panama is the only place on the west side of a great continent where the wind shifts regularly at different seasons; there it is easterly between September and March; but between March and September it blows chiefly from the south and south-west.\n\nSuch in general is the direction of the winds in the torrid zone all over the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans; but they are subject to particular exceptions, which we shall now endeavour to enumerate. On the coast of Africa, from Cape Bayador to Cape Verde, the winds are generally north-west; from thence to the island of St Thomas near the equator they blow almost perpendicular to the shore, bending gradually as we advance southwards, first to the west and then to the south-west. On the coast of New Spain likewise, from California to the bay of Panama, the winds blow almost constantly from the west or south-west, except during May, June, and July, when land-winds prevail, called by the Spaniards Popogayos. On the coast of Chili and Peru, from 20\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 south latitude, to the equator, and on the parallel coast of Africa, the wind blows during the whole year from the south, varying according to the direction of the land towards which it inclines, and extending much farther out to sea on the American than the African coast. The trade-winds are also interrupted sometimes by westerly winds in the bay of Campeachy and the bay of Honduras.\n\nAs to the countries between the tropics, we are too little acquainted with them to be able to give a satisfactory history of their winds.\n\nIn all maritime countries between the tropics, of any extent, the wind blows during a certain number of hours every day from the sea, and during a certain number towards the sea from the land; these winds are called the sea and land breezes. The sea breeze generally sets in about 10 in the forenoon, and blows till six in the evening; at seven the land breeze begins and continues till eight in the morning, when it dies away. During summer the sea breeze is very perceptible on all the coasts of the Mediterranean sea, and even sometimes as far north as Norway.\n\nVol. XIII. Part II.\n\nIn the island of St Lewis on the coast of Africa, in 16\u00b0 north latitude, and 16\u00b0 west longitude, the wind during the rainy season, which lasts from the middle of July to the middle of October, is generally between the south and the east; during the rest of the year it is for the most part east or north-east in the morning; but as the sun rises, the wind approaches gradually towards the north, till about noon it gets to the west of north, and is called a sea breeze. Sometimes it shifts to the east as the sun declines, and continues there during the whole night. In February, March, April, May and June, it blows almost constantly between the north and west. In the island of Bulama, which likewise lies on the west coast of Africa, in 11\u00b0 north latitude, the wind during nine months of the year blows from the south-west; but in November and December, a very cold wind blows from the north-east.\n\nIn the kingdom of Bornou, which lies between 16\u00b0 and 20\u00b0 north latitude, the warm season is introduced about the middle of April by sultry winds from the south-east, which bring along with them a deluge of rain. In Fezzan, in 25\u00b0 north latitude, and 35\u00b0 east longitude, the wind from May to August blows from the east south-east, or south-west, and is intensely hot.\n\nIn Abyssinia the winds generally blow from the north-west, north, and north-east. During the Abyssinian months of June, July, August, September and October, the north and north-east winds blow almost constantly, especially in the morning and evening; and during the rest of the year they are much more frequent than any other winds.\n\nAt Calcutta, in the province of Bengal, the wind blows during January and February from the south-west and south; in March, April, and May from the south; in June, July, August and September, from the south and south-east; in October, November, and December, from the north-west. At Madras the most frequent winds are the north and north-east. At Tivoli in St Domingo, and the illes des Vaches, the wind blows oftenest from the south and south-east. From these facts it appears, that in most tropical countries with which we are acquainted, the wind generally blows from the nearest ocean, except during the coldest months, when it blows towards it.\n\nIn the temperate zones the direction of the wind is by no means so regular as between the tropics. Even in the same degree of latitude, we find them often blowing in different directions at the same time, while their changes are often so sudden and capricious, that to account for them has been hitherto found impossible. When winds are violent and continue long, they generally extend over a large tract of country; and this is more certainly the case when they blow from the north-east, than from any other points. By the multiplication and comparison of meteorological tables, some regular connection between the changes of the atmosphere in different places may in time be observed, which will at last lead to a satisfactory theory of the winds. It is from such tables chiefly that the following facts have been collected.\n\nIn Virginia, the prevailing winds are between the south-west, west, north, and north-west; the most frequent is the south-west, which blows more constantly in June, July, and August, than at any other season. The north-west winds blow most constantly in November.\nWinds, December, January, and February. At Ipswich in New England, the prevailing winds are also between the south-west, west, north, and north-east; the most frequent is the north-west. But at Cambridge, in the same province, the most frequent wind is the south-east. The predominant winds at New York are the north and west. In Nova Scotia north-west winds blow for three-fourths of the year. The same wind blows most frequently at Montreal in Canada, but at Quebec the wind generally follows the direction of the river St Lawrence, blowing either from the north-east or south-west. At Hudson's bay westerly winds blow for three-fourths of the year; the north-west wind occasions the greatest cold; but the north and north-east are the vehicles of snow.\n\nIt appears from these facts, that westerly winds are most frequent over the whole eastern coast of North America; that in the southern provinces south-west winds predominate, and that the north-west become gradually more frequent as we approach the frigid zone.\n\nIn Egypt, during part of May, and during June, July, August, and September, the wind blows almost constantly from the north, varying sometimes in June to the west, and in July to the west and the east; during part of September, and in October and November, the winds are variable, but blow more regularly from the east than any other quarter; in December, January, and February, they blow from the north, north-west, and west; towards the end of February they change to the south, in which quarter they continue till near the end of March; during the last days of March and in April they blow from the south-east, south, and south-west, and at last from the east; and in this direction they continue during a part of May.\n\nIn the Mediterranean the wind blows nearly three-fourths of the year from the north; about the equinoxes there is always an easterly wind in that sea, which is generally more constant in spring than in autumn. These observations do not apply to the gulf of Gibraltar, where there are seldom any winds except the east and the west. At Bastia, in the island of Corsica, the prevailing wind is the south-west.\n\nIn Syria the north wind blows from the autumnal equinox to November; during December, January, and February, the winds blow from the west and south-west; in March they blow from the south, in May from the east, and in June from the north. From this month to the autumnal equinox the wind changes gradually as the sun approaches the equator; first to the east, then to the south, and lastly to the west. At Bagdad the most frequent winds are the south-west and north-west; at Pekin, the north and the south; at Kamchatka, on the north-east coast of Asia, the prevailing winds blow from the west.\n\nIn Italy the prevailing winds differ considerably according to the situation of the places where the observations have been made. At Rome and Padua they are northerly, at Milan easterly. All that we have been able to learn respecting Spain and Portugal is, that on the west coast of these countries the west is by far the most common wind, particularly in summer; and that at Madrid the wind is north-east for the greatest part of the summer, blowing almost constantly from the Pyrenean mountains. At Berne in Switzerland, the prevailing winds are the north and west; at St Gotthard, the north-east; at Lausanne the north-west and south-west.\n\nM. Cotte has given us the result of observations made at 86 different places of France, from which it appears, that along the whole south coast of that empire the wind blows most frequently from the north, north-west, and north-east; on the west coast, from the west, the winds south-west, and north-west; and on the north coast in France, from the south-west. That in the interior parts of France the south-west wind blows most frequently in 18 places; the west wind in 14; the north in 13; the south in 6; the north-east in 4; the south-east in 2; the east and north-west each of them in one. On the west coast of the Netherlands, as far north as Rotterdam, the prevailing winds are probably the south-west; at least this is the case at Dunkirk and Rotterdam. It is probable also, that along the rest of this coast, from the Hague to Hamburg, the prevailing winds are the north-west, at least these winds are most frequent at the Hague and at Franeker. The prevailing wind at Delft is the south-east, and at Breda the north and the east.\n\nIn Germany the east wind is most frequent at Gottingen, Munich, Weissenburg, Dusseldorf, Sagan, Erfurt, and at Buda in Hungary; the south-east at Prague and Wurtzburg; the north-east at Ratibon, and the west at Mainheim and Berlin.\n\nFrom an average of 10 years of the register kept by order of the Royal Society, it appears, that at London the winds blow in the following order:\n\n| Winds     | Days |\n|-----------|------|\n| South-west | 112  |\n| North-east | 58   |\n| North-west | 50   |\n| West      | 53   |\n\nIt appears from the same register, that the south-west wind blows at an average more frequently than any other wind during every month of the year, and that it blows longest in July and August; that the north-east wind blows most constantly during January, March, April, May, and June, and most seldom during February, July, September, and December; and that the north-west wind blows oftener from November to March, and more seldom during September and October, than any other months. The south-west winds are also most frequent at Bristol, and next to them are the north-east.\n\nThe following table of the winds at Lancaster has been drawn up from a register kept for seven years at that place:\n\n| Winds     | Days |\n|-----------|------|\n| South-west | 92   |\n| North-east | 67   |\n| South     | 51   |\n| West      | 41   |\n\nThe following table is an abstract of nine years observations made at Dumfries by Mr Copland.\n\n| Winds     | Days |\n|-----------|------|\n| South     | 82\u00bd |\n| West      | 69   |\n| East      | 68   |\n| South-west | 50\u00bd |\n\nThe\nThe following table is an abstract of seven years observations, made by Dr Meek at Cambullang, near Glasgow.\n\n| Winds       | Days | Winds     | Days |\n|-------------|------|-----------|------|\n| South-west  | 174  | North-east| 104  |\n| North-west  | 40   | South-east| 47   |\n\nIt appears from the register from which this table was extracted, that the north-east wind blows much more frequently in April, May, and June, and the south-west in July, August, and September, than at any other period. We learn from the Statistical Account of Scotland, that the south-west is by far the most frequent wind all over that kingdom, especially on the west coast. At Saltcoats in Ayrshire, for instance, it blows three fourths of the year; and along the whole coast of Murray on the north-east side of Scotland, it blows for two-thirds of the year. East winds are common over all Great Britain during April and May; but their influence is felt most severely on the eastern coast.\n\nThe following table exhibits a view of the number of days during which the westerly and easterly winds blow in a year, at different parts of the island. Under the term westerly are included the north-west, west, south-west, and south; the term easterly is taken in the same latitude.\n\n| Years of observation | Places          | Wind |\n|---------------------|-----------------|------|\n|                     |                 | Westerly | Easterly |\n| 10                  | London          | 233    | 132    |\n| 7                   | Lancaster       | 216    | 149    |\n| 51                  | Liverpool       | 190    | 175    |\n| 9                   | Dumfries        | 227.5  | 137.5  |\n| 10                  | Bransholm       | 232    | 133    |\n| 7                   | Cambullang      | 214    | 151    |\n| 8                   | Hawkhill near Edin.| 229.5 | 135.5 |\n|                     | Medium          | 220.3  | 144.7  |\n\nIn Ireland the south-west and west are the grand trade-winds, blowing most in summer, autumn, and winter, and least in spring. The north-east blows most in spring, and nearly double what it does in autumn and winter. The south-west and north-west are nearly equal, and are most frequent after the south-west and west.\n\nAt Copenhagen the prevailing winds are the east and south-east; at Stockholm, the west and north. In Russia, from an average of a register of 16 years, the winds blow from November to April in the following order:\n\n| W. N.W. E. S.W. S. N.E. N. S.E. |\n|---------------------------------|\n| Days 45 26 23 22 20 19 14 12    |\n\nAnd during the other six months,\n\n| W. N.W. E. S.W. S. N.E. N. S.E. |\n|---------------------------------|\n| Days 27 27 19 24 22 15 32 18    |\n\nThe west wind blows during the whole year 72 days; the north-west 53, the south-west and north 40 days each. During summer it is calm for 41 days, and during winter for 21. In Norway the most frequent winds are the south, the south-west and south east. The wind at Bergen is seldom directly west, but generally south-west or south-east; a north-west, and especially a north-east wind, are but little known there.\n\nFrom the whole of these facts, it appears that the most frequent winds on the south coasts of Europe are the north, the north-east and north-west, and on the western coast the south-west; that in the interior parts which lie most contiguous to the Atlantic ocean, south-west winds are also most frequent; but that easterly winds prevail in Germany. Westerly winds are also most frequent on the north-east coast of Asia.\n\nIt is probable that the winds are more constant in the south temperate zone, which is in a great measure covered with water, than in the north temperate zones, where their direction must be frequently interrupted and altered by mountains and other causes.\n\nM. de la Bailie, who was sent thither by the French king to make astronomical observations, informs us, at the Cape of Good Hope the main winds are the south-east and north-west; that other winds seldom last longer than a few hours; and that the east and north-east winds blow very seldom. The south-east wind blows in most months of the year, but chiefly from October to April; the north-west prevails during the other five months, bringing along with it rain, and tempests, and hurricanes. Between the Cape of Good Hope and New Holland the winds are commonly westerly, and blow in the following order: north-west, south-west, west, north.\n\nIn the great South sea, from latitude 30\u00b0 to 40\u00b0 in the Pacific ocean, the south-east trade-wind blows most frequently, especially when the sun approaches the tropic of Capricorn; the wind next to it in frequency is the north-west, and next to that is the south-west.\n\nThus it appears that the trade-winds sometimes extend farther into the south temperate zone than their usual limits, particularly during summer; that beyond their influence the winds are commonly westerly, and that they blow in the following order: north-west, south-west, west.\n\nWe have now considered pretty much at large the theory of direction of the winds in different parts of the earth's surface. Another very curious part of the history of the winds relates to their violence, and the effects with which they are attended, or to the history of hurricanes, whirlwinds, tornadoes, &c. Of some of these we have already treated under the articles Hurricane and Harmattan; and the confined limits of this article oblige us to refer our readers for more particulars to Capper's Observations on the Winds and Monsoons.\n\nAs to the velocity of the wind, its variations are almost infinite, from the gentlest breeze, to the hurricane, which tears up trees and blows down houses. Our most violent winds take place when neither the heat nor the cold is greatest; violent winds generally extend over a large tract of country, and they are accompanied with sudden and great falls in the mercury of the barometer. The wind is sometimes very violent at a distance from the earth, while it is quite calm at its surface. On one occasion Lunardi went at the rate of 70 miles an hour in his balloon, though it was quite calm at Edinburgh when he ascended, and continued so during his whole voyage.\nA pretty good idea of the velocity of the wind, under different circumstances, may be formed from the following table, which was drawn up by Mr Smeaton.\n\n| Miles per Hour | Feet per Second | Perpendicular force on one square foot, in Avoirdupois pounds and Paris |\n|---------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1             | 1.47            | .005 Hardly perceptible.                                               |\n| 2             | 2.93            | .020 Just perceptible.                                                |\n| 3             | 4.4             | .044 Gently pleasant.                                                 |\n| 4             | 5.87            | .079 Gently pleasant.                                                 |\n| 5             | 7.33            | .123 Pleasant, brisk.                                                 |\n| 10            | 14.67           | .492 Pleasant, brisk.                                                 |\n| 15            | 22.             | 1.107                                                                  |\n| 20            | 29.34           | 1.968 Very brisk.                                                     |\n| 25            | 36.67           | 3.075 High wind.                                                      |\n| 30            | 44.01           | 4.429 Very high wind.                                                 |\n| 35            | 51.34           | 6.027 Storm or tempest.                                               |\n| 40            | 58.68           | 7.873 Great storm.                                                    |\n| 45            | 66.01           | 9.963 Hurricane.                                                       |\n| 50            | 73.35           | 12.300 Hurricane that tears up trees and carries buildings before it. |\n| 60            | 88.02           | 17.715                                                               |\n| 80            | 117.36          | 31.490                                                               |\n| 100           | 146.7           | 49.200                                                               |\n\nFor the means of ascertaining the velocity of the winds, see ANEMOMETER and ANEMOSCOPE.\n\nWe shall now endeavour to explain the phenomena that we have been describing, or to form a plausible theory of the winds.\n\nThe atmosphere is a fluid surrounding the earth, and extending to an unknown height. Now all fluids tend invariably to a level: if a quantity of water be taken out of any part of a vessel, the surrounding water will immediately flow in to supply its place, and the surface will become level as before; or if an additional quantity of water be poured into any part of the vessel, it will not remain there, but diffuse itself equally over the whole. Such exactly would be the case with the atmosphere. Whatever therefore destroys the equilibrium of this fluid, either by increasing or diminishing its bulk in any particular place, must at the same time occasion a wind.\n\nAir, besides its qualities in common with other fluids, is also capable of being dilated and compressed. Suppose a vessel filled with air: if half the quantity which it contains be drawn out by means of an air-pump, the remainder will still fill the vessel completely; or if twice or three times the original quantity be forced in by a condenser, the vessel will still be capable of holding it.\n\nRarefied air is lighter, and condensed air heavier than common air. When fluids of unequal specific gravities are mixed together, the heavier always descend and the lighter ascend. Were quicksilver, water, and oil, thrown into the same vessel together, the quicksilver would uniformly occupy the bottom; the water the middle, and the oil the top. Were water to be thrown into a vessel of oil, it would immediately descend, because it is heavier than oil. Exactly the same thing takes place in the atmosphere. Were a quantity of air, for instance, to be suddenly condensed at a distance from the surface of the earth, being now heavier than before, it would descend till it came to air of its own density; or, were a portion of the atmosphere at the surface of the earth to be suddenly rarefied, being now lighter than the surrounding air, it would immediately ascend.\n\nIf a bladder half filled with air be exposed to the heat of a fire, the air within will soon expand, and distend the bladder; if it be now removed to a cold place, it will soon become flaccid as before. This shows that heat rarefies, and that cold condenses air. The surface of the torrid zone is much more heated by the rays of the sun than the frozen or temperate zones, because the rays fall upon it much more perpendicularly. This heat is communicated to the air near the surface of the torrid zone, which being thereby rarefied, ascends, and its place is supplied by colder air, which rushes in from the north and south.\n\nThe diurnal motion of the earth is greatest at the equator, and diminishes gradually as we approach the poles, where it ceases altogether. Every spot of the earth's surface at the equator moves at the rate of 15 geographical miles in a minute; at 40\u00b0 of latitude it moves at about 11 miles and a half in a minute, and at the 30\u00b0 at nearly 13 miles. The atmosphere, by moving continually round along with the earth, has acquired the same degree of motion, so that those parts of it which are above the equator move faster than those which are at a distance. Were a portion of the atmosphere to be transported in an instant from latitude 30\u00b0 to the equator, it would not immediately acquire the velocity of the equator; the eminences of the earth, therefore, would strike against it, and it would assume the appearance of an easterly wind. This is the case in a smaller degree with the air that flows towards the equator, to supply the place of the rarefied air which is continually ascending; and this, when combined with its real motion from north to south, must cause it to assume the appearance of a north-easterly wind on this side the equator, and of a south-westerly beyond it.\n\nThe motion westward occasioned by this difference in celerity alone, would be very small; but it is increased by another circumstance. Since the rarefaction of the air in the torrid zone is owing to the heat derived from the contiguous earth, and since this heat is owing to the perpendicular rays of the sun, those parts must be hottest where the sun is actually vertical; and consequently the air above them must be most rarefied; the contiguous parts of the atmosphere will therefore be drawn most forcibly to that particular spot. Now, since the diurnal motion of the earth is from east to west, this hottest spot will be continually shifting westwards, and this will occasion a current of the atmosphere in that direction. That this cause really operates, appears from a circumstance already mentioned: When the sun approaches either of the tropics, the trade-wind on the same side of the equator assumes a more easterly direction, evidently from the cause here mentioned, while the opposite trade-wind being deprived of this additional impulse, blows in a direction more perpendicular to the equator.\n\nThe westerly direction of the trade-wind is still farther increased by another cause. Since the attraction of the sun and moon produces so remarkable an effect...\nWinds effect upon the ocean, we cannot but suppose that an effect equally great, at least, is produced upon the atmosphere. Indeed as the atmosphere is nearer the moon than the sea is, the effects produced by attraction upon it ought to be greater. When we add to this the elasticity of the air, or that disposition which it has to dilate itself when freed from any of its pressure, we cannot but conclude, that the tides in the atmosphere are considerable. Now since the apparent diurnal motion of the moon is from east to west, the tides must follow it in the same manner, and consequently produce a constant motion in the atmosphere from east to west. This reasoning is confirmed by the observations of several philosophers, particularly of M. Caffon, that in the torrid zone the barometer is always two-thirds of a line higher twice every 24 hours than during the rest of the day; and that the time of this rise always corresponds with the tides of the sea; a proof that it proceeds from the same cause.\n\nAll these different causes probably combine in the production of the trade-winds; and from their being sometimes united, and sometimes distinct or opposite, arise all those little irregularities which take place in the direction and force of the trade-winds.\n\nSince the great cause of these winds is the rarefaction of the atmosphere by the heat of the sun, its ascension and the consequent rushing in of colder air from the north and south, the internal boundary of the trade-winds must be that parallel of the torrid zone which is hottest, because there the ascension of the rarefied air must take place. Now since the sun does not remain stationary, but is constantly shifting from one tropic to the other, we ought naturally to expect that this boundary would vary together with its exciting cause; that therefore, when the sun is perpendicular to the tropic of Cancer, the north-east trade-wind would extend no farther south than north latitude $23^\\circ 30'$; that the south-east wind would extend as far north; and that, when the sun was in the tropic of Capricorn, the very contrary would take place. We have seen, however, that though this boundary be subject to considerable changes from this very cause, it may in general be considered as fixed between the second and fifth degrees of north latitude.\n\nThough the sun be perpendicular to each of the tropics during part of the year, he is for one half of it at a considerable distance, so that the heat which they acquire, while he is present, is more than lost during his absence. But the sun is perpendicular to the equator twice in a year, and never farther distant from it than $23\\frac{1}{2}^\\circ$; being therefore twice every year as much heated, and never so much cooled as the tropics, its mean heat must be greater, and the atmosphere in consequence generally most rarefied at that place. Why then, it will be asked, is not the equator the boundary of the two trade-winds? To speak more accurately than we have hitherto done, the internal limit of these winds must be that parallel where the mean heat of the earth is greatest. This would be the equator, were it not for a reason that shall now be explained.\n\nIt has been shewn by astronomers, that the orbit of the earth is an ellipse, and that the sun is placed in one of the foci. Were this orbit to be divided into two parts by a straight line perpendicular to the transverse axis, and passing through the centre of the sun, one of these parts would be less than the other; and the earth during its passage through the smaller part of its orbit, would constantly be nearer the sun than while it moved through the other portion. The celerity of the earth's motion in any part of its orbit is always proportioned to its distance from the sun; the nearer it is to the sun it moves the faster; the farther distant, the slower. The earth passes over the smaller portion of its orbit during our winter, which must therefore be shorter than our summer, both on account of this part of the orbit being smaller than the other, and on account of the increased celerity of the earth's motion. The difference, according to Cassini, is 7 days, 23 hours, 53 minutes. While it is winter in the northern, it is summer in the southern hemisphere; wherefore the summer in the southern hemisphere must be just as much shorter than the winter, as our winter is shorter than our summer. The difference, therefore, between the length of the summer in the two hemispheres is almost 16 days. The summer in the northern hemisphere consists of 190$\\frac{1}{2}$ days, while in the southern it consists only of 174$\\frac{1}{2}$. They are to one another nearly in the proportion of 14 to 12.8; and the heat of the two hemispheres may probably have nearly the same proportion to one another. The internal limit of the trade-winds ought to be that parallel where the mean heat of the globe is greatest; this would be the equator, if both hemispheres were equally hot; but since the northern hemisphere is the hottest, that parallel ought to be situated somewhere in it; and since the difference between the heat of the two hemispheres is not great, the parallel ought not to be so far distant from the equator.\n\nThe trade-wind would blow regularly round the whole globe if the torrid zone were all covered with water. If the Indian ocean were not bounded by land on the north, it would blow there in the same manner as it does in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The rays of light pass through a transparent body without communicating any, or at least but a small degree of heat. If a piece of wood be inclosed in a glass vessel, and the focus of a burning-glass directed upon it, the wood will burn to ashes, while the glass through which all the rays passed is not even heated. When an opaque body is exposed to the sun's rays, it is heated in proportion to its opacity. If the bulb of a thermometer be exposed to the sun, the mercury will not rise so high as it would do if this bulb were painted black. Land is much more opaque than water; it becomes therefore much warmer when both are equally exposed to the influence of the sun. For this reason, when the sun approaches the tropic of Cancer, India, China, and the adjacent countries, become much hotter than the ocean which washes their southern coasts. The air over them becomes rarefied, and ascends, while colder air rushes in from the Indian ocean to supply its place. As this current of air moves from the equator northward, it must, for a reason already explained, assume the appearance of a south-west wind; and this tendency eastward is increased by the situation of the countries to which it flows. This is the cause of the south-west monsoon, which blows during summer in the northern parts of the Indian ocean. Between Borneo and the coast of China, its direction is almost due north, because...\ncause the country to which the current is directed lies rather to the west of north; a circumstance which counteracts its greater velocity.\n\nIn winter, when the sun is on the south side of the equator, these countries become cool, and the north-east trade-wind resumes its course, which, had it not been for the interference of these countries, would have continued the whole year.\n\nAs the sun approaches the tropic of Capricorn, it becomes almost perpendicular to New Holland; that continent is heated in its turn, the air over it is rarified, and colder air rushes in from the north and west to supply its place. This is the cause of the north-west monsoon, which blows from October to April, from 3\u00b0 to 15\u00b0 south latitude. Near Sumatra its direction is regulated by the coast; this is the case also between Africa and Madagascar.\n\nThe same cause which occasions the monsoons, gives rise to the winds which blow on the west coasts of Africa and America. The air above the land is hotter and rarer, and consequently lighter than the air above the sea; the sea air, therefore, flows in, and forces the lighter land atmosphere to ascend.\n\nThe same thing will account for the phenomena of the sea and land breezes. During the day, the cool air of the sea, loaded with vapors, flows in upon the land, and takes the place of the rarefied land air. As the sun declines, the rarefaction of the land air is diminished; thus an equilibrium is restored. As the sea is not so much heated during the day as the land, neither is it so much cooled during the night, because it is constantly exposing a new surface to the atmosphere. As the night approaches, therefore, the cooler and denser air of the hills (for where there are no hills there are no sea and land breezes) falls down upon the plains, and preluding upon the now comparatively lighter air of the sea, causes the land breeze.\n\nThe rarefied air which ascends between 2\u00b0 and 5\u00b0 north latitude, has been shewn to be the principal cause of the trade-winds. As this air ascends, it must become gradually colder, and consequently heavier; it would therefore descend again if it were not buoyed up by the constant ascent of new rarefied air. It must therefore spread itself to the north and south, and gradually mix in its passage with the lower air; and the greater part of it probably does not reach far beyond 30\u00b0, which is the external limit of the trade-wind. Thus there is a constant circulation of the atmosphere in the torrid zone; it ascends near the equator, diffuses itself toward the north and south, descends gradually as it approaches 30\u00b0, and, returning again towards the equator, performs the same circuit. It has been the opinion of the greater part of those who have considered this subject, that the whole of the rarefied air which ascends near the equator, advances towards the poles and descends there. But if this were the case, a constant wind would blow from both poles towards the equator, and the trade winds would extend over the whole earth; for otherwise the ascent of air in the torrid zone would very soon cease. A little reflection must convince us that it cannot be true. Rarefied air differs in nothing from the common air, except in containing a greater quantity of heat. As it ascends, it gradually loses this superfluous heat. What then should hinder it from descending, and mixing with the atmosphere below?\n\nThat there is a constant current of superior air, however, towards the poles, cannot be doubted; but it consists principally of hydrogen gas. We shall immediately attempt to assign the reason why its accumulation at the pole is not always attended with a north wind.\n\nIf the attraction of the moon and the diurnal motion of the sun have any effect upon the atmosphere, and that they have some effect can hardly be disputed, there must be a real motion of the air westwards within the limits of the trade-winds. When this body of air reaches America, its further passage westwards is stopped by the mountains which extend from one extremity of that continent to the other. From the momentum of this air, when it strikes against the sides of these mountains, and from its elasticity, it must acquire from them a considerable velocity, in a direction contrary to the first, and would therefore return eastwards again if this were not prevented by the trade-winds. It must therefore rush forwards in that direction where it meets with the least resistance; that is, towards the north and south. As air is nearly a perfectly elastic body, when it strikes against the sides of the American mountains, its velocity will not be perceptibly diminished, though its direction be changed. Continuing to move, therefore, with the velocity of the equator, when it arrives at the temperate zones it will assume the appearance of a north-east or south-east wind. To this is to be ascribed the frequency of south-west winds over the Atlantic ocean and western parts of Europe. Whether these winds are equally frequent in the northern Pacific ocean, we have not been able to ascertain; but it is probable that the mountains in Asia produce the same effect as those in America.\n\nIt is not impossible that another circumstance may also contribute to the production of these winds. The oxygen, which is rather heavier than common air, may mix with the atmosphere; but the hydrogen (a cubic foot of which weighs only 41.41 grains, while a cubic foot of oxygen weighs 59.332 grains) may ascend to the higher regions of the atmosphere.\n\nBy what means the decomposition is accomplished (if it takes place at all) we cannot tell. There are probably a thousand causes in nature of which we are entirely ignorant. Whether heat and light, when long applied to vapors, may not be able to decompose them, by uniting with the hydrogen, which seems to have a greater attraction for heat than oxygen has, or whether the electrical fluid may not be capable of producing this effect, are questions which future observations and experiments must determine. Dr Franklin filled a glass tube with water, and passed an electrical shock through it; the tube was broken in pieces, and the whole water disappeared. He repeated the experiment with ink instead of water, and placed the tube upon white paper; the same effects followed, and the ink, though it disappeared completely, left no stain on the paper. Whether the water in these cases was decomposed or not, it is impossible to say; but the supposition that it was, is not improbable. An experiment might easily be contrived to determine the point.\n\nThis decomposition would account for the frequency of south-west winds, particularly in summer; for this new air is furnished to supply the place of that which is forced northwards by the causes already explained.\nPerhaps it may be a confirmation of this conjecture, that the south-west winds generally extend over a greater tract of country than most other winds which blow in the temperate zones. What has been said of south-west winds holds equally with regard to north-west winds in the south temperate zone.\n\nAfter south-west winds have blown for some time, a great quantity of air will be accumulated at the pole, at least if they extend over all the northern hemisphere; and it appears, from comparing the tables kept by some of our late navigators in the northern Pacific ocean with similar tables kept in this island, that this is sometimes the case so far as relates to the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. When this accumulation becomes great, it must, from the nature of fluids, and from the elasticity of the air, press with a considerable and increasing force on the advancing air; so that in time it becomes stronger than the south-west wind. This will occasion at first a calm, and afterwards a north wind, which will become gradually easterly as it advances southwards, from its not affuming immediately the velocity of the earth. The mass of the atmosphere will be increased in all those places over which this north-east wind blows; this is confirmed by the almost constant rise of the barometer during a north-east wind.\n\nWhatever tends to increase the bulk of the atmosphere near the pole, must tend also to increase the frequency of north-east winds; and if there be any reason when this increase takes place more particularly, that reason will be most liable to these winds. During winter the northern parts of Europe are covered with snow, which is melted in the beginning of summer, when the heat of the sun becomes more powerful. Great quantities of vapour are during that time raised, which will augment both the bulk and weight of the atmosphere, especially if the conjecture about the conversion of vapour into air has any foundation. Hence north-east winds are most prevalent during May and June.\n\nBut it will be said, if this hypothesis were true, the south-west and north-east winds ought to blow alternately, and continue each of them for a stated time; whereas the south-west wind blows sometimes longer and sometimes shorter, neither is it always followed by a north-east wind.\n\nIf the conjecture about the decomposition of vapour in the torrid zone be true, the hydrogen which formed a part of it will ascend from its lightness, and form a stratum above the atmospheric air, and gradually extend itself, as additional hydrogen rises, towards the north and south, till at last it reaches the poles. The lightness of hydrogen is owing to the great quantity of heat which it contains; as it approaches the poles it must lose a great part of this heat, and may in consequence become heavy enough to mix with the atmosphere below. Oxygen makes a part of the atmosphere; and its proportion near the poles may sometimes be greater than ordinary, on account of the additional quantity brought thither from the torrid zone. Mr Cavendish mixed oxygen and hydrogen together in a glass jar; and upon making an electrical spark pass through them, they immediately combined and formed water.\n\nThat there is electric matter at the poles, cannot be doubted. The abbe Chappe informs us, that he saw thunder and lightning much more frequently at Tobolsk and other parts of Siberia, than in any other part of the world. In the north of Europe, the air, during very cold weather, is exceedingly electric; sparks can be drawn from a person's hands and face, by combing his hair, or even powdering him with a puff. Aepinus was an eye-witness to this fact, and to still more astonishing proofs of the electricity of the atmosphere during great colds.\n\nMay not the appearance of the aurora borealis be owing to the union of oxygen and hydrogen by the intervention of the electric fluid? That it is an electrical phenomenon, at least, can hardly be doubted. Artificial electricity is much strengthened during an aurora, as Mr Volta and Mr Canton have observed; and the magnetic needle moves with the same irregularity during an aurora that has been observed in other electrical phenomena. This fact we learn from Bergman and De la Lande. Many philosophers have attempted to demonstrate, that aurora borealis are beyond the earth's atmosphere; but the very different results of their calculations evidently prove that they were not possessed of sufficient data.\n\nIf this conjecture be true, part of the atmosphere near the poles must at times be converted into water. This would account for the long continuance of south-west winds at particular times; when they do so, a decomposition of the atmosphere is going on at the pole. It would render this conjecture more probable, if the barometer fell always when a south-west wind continues long.\n\nIf this hypothesis be true, a south-west wind ought always to blow after aurora borealis; and we are in winds very formed by Mr Winn, that this is actually the case, common after aurora borealis. This he found never to fail in 23 instances. He observed also, that when the aurora was bright, the gale came on within 24 hours, but did not last long; but if it was faint and dull, the gale was longer in beginning, and less violent, but it continued longer. This looks like a confirmation of our conjecture. Bright auroras are probably nearer than those which are dull. Now, if the aurora borealis be attended with a decomposition of a quantity of air, that part of the atmosphere which is nearest must first rush in to supply the distant parts. Just as if a hole were bored in the end of a long vessel filled with water, the water nearest the hole would flow out immediately, and it would be some time before the water at the other end of the vessel began to move. The nearer we are to the place of precipitation, the sooner will we feel the south-west wind. It ought therefore to begin sooner after a bright aurora, because it is nearer than a dull and faint one. Precipitations of the atmosphere at a distance from the pole cannot be so great as those which take place near it; because the cold will not be sufficient to condense so great a quantity of hydrogen; south-west winds, therefore, ought not to last so long after bright as after dull auroras. Winds are more violent after bright auroras, because they are nearer the place of precipitation; just as the water near the hole of the vessel runs swifter than that which is at a considerable distance.\n\nIf these conjectures have any foundation in nature, there are two sources of south-west winds; the first has causes of its origin in the trade-winds, the second in precipitations of the atmosphere near the pole. When they originate from the first cause, they will blow in countries farther\nfarther south for some time before they are felt in those which are farther north; but the contrary will take place when they are owing to the second cause. In this last case, too, the barometer will sink considerably; and it actually does so constantly after aurora, as we are informed by Mr Madison, who paid particular attention to this subject. By keeping accurate meteorological tables in different latitudes, it might easily be discovered whether these consequences be true, and of course whether the above conjectures be well or ill grounded.\n\nIt appears that winds generally commence at that point towards which they blow; and hence they must arise from a rarefaction and consequent displacement of the air in some particular place, by the action of heat, or which they come other cause. Perhaps, according to the idea of Mr Williams, this cause may be an increased precipitation of the superior strata of air, rendered unusually dense from its being furnished with moisture in the place where the wind begins to blow, or from an increased evaporation from a humid surface in the opposite direction.\n\nHurricanes are constantly preceded by a great depression of the thermometer; and in these cases the wind often seems to blow from every direction towards the quarter where this fall of the barometer is observed.\n\nViolent winds from the north-east have repeatedly been observed to begin at the quarter towards which they blow. In 1749 Dr Franklin was prevented from observing an eclipse of the moon at Philadelphia by a north-east storm, which came about seven o'clock in the evening. He was surprised to find afterwards that it had not come on at Boston till near 11 o'clock; and, upon comparing all the accounts which he received from the several colonies of the beginning of this and other storms of the same kind, he found it to be always an hour later the farther north-east, for every 100 miles. \"From hence (says he) I formed an idea of the course of the storm, which I will explain by a familiar instance. Suppose a long canal of water stopped at the end by a gate. The water is at rest till the gate is opened; then it begins to move out through the gate, and the water next the gate is first in motion, and moves on towards the gate, and so on successively, till the water at the head of the canal is in motion, which it is last of all. In this case the water moves indeed towards the gate; but the successive times of beginning the motion are in the contrary way, viz., from the gate back to the head of the canal. Thus to produce a north-east storm, I suppose some great rarefaction of the air in or near the gulf of Mexico; the air rising thence has its place supplied by the next more northern, cooler, and therefore denser and heavier air; a successive current is formed, to which our coast and inland mountains give a north-east direction.\"\n\nSeveral instances of a similar kind have occurred. In 1822, Dr Mitchell observed a storm which began at Charlestown on the 21st of February, at two o'clock P.M., but was not observed at Washington, several hundred miles to the north-east, till five o'clock; at New York till 10, nor at Albany till daybreak of the following morning. Hence it appears that it must have moved at the rate of 1100 miles in 11 hours, or 100 miles an hour.\n\nA remarkable storm of this kind, in which the wind was easterly, and attended with a heavy fall of snow, was observed in Scotland on the 8th of February 1799; but the motion of the wind was much slower. It began to snow at Falkirk on the 7th of February at six in the evening, but at Edinburgh not till one o'clock A.M. on the 8th; and the snow was not observed at Dunbar till seven hours after. The storm continued 11 hours, during which time it did not travel more than 100 miles.\n\nCurrents of air from the poles naturally assume a north-east direction as they advance southwards, because their diurnal motion becomes less than that of the earth. Various circumstances, however, may change this direction, and cause them to become north, or even north-west winds. The south-west winds themselves may often prove sufficient for this; and violent rains, or great heat, by lessening or rarefying the atmosphere in any country, will produce the same effect in countries to the westwards, when north winds happen to be blowing.\n\nIn North America, the north-west winds become gradually more frequent as we advance northwards. The east coast of this continent, where the observations were made from which this conclusion was drawn, is alone cultivated; the rest of the country is covered with wood. Now cultivated countries are generally considered as warmer than those which are uncultivated, though Mr Williams is of a different opinion; and on this circumstance founded his hypothesis of the climate of Britain being much deteriorated during the last 50 years. The air, therefore, in the interior parts of the country should be constantly colder than the east coast. This difference will scarcely be perceptible in the southern parts, because there the influence of the sun is very powerful; but it will become gradually greater as we advance northwards, because the influence of the sun diminishes, and the continent becomes broader. Hence north-west winds ought to become more frequent upon the east coast as we advance northwards; and they will probably cease to blow so often as soon as the whole continent of North America becomes cultivated.\n\nThere is one curious circumstance which deserves attention. One current of air is often observed to blow at currents of the surface of the earth, while a current in the contrary ten appear direction is flowing in a superior part of the atmosphere, sphere at Dr Thomson on one occasion observed three currents the same of this kind blowing all at the same time in contrary directions. It has been affirmed that changes of weather commonly commence in the upper strata, and that they are gradually extended by the current of air that commences above, proceeding towards the lower parts of the atmosphere.\n\nBesides these more general winds, there are others Partial which extend only over a very small part of the earth, winds. These originate from many different causes. The atmosphere is principally composed of three different kinds of air, oxygen, azote, and carbonic acid, to which may be added water. Great quantities of each of these ingredients are constantly changing their aerial form, and combining with various substances; or they are separating from other bodies, assuming the form of air, and mixing with the atmosphere. Partial deficiencies, therefore, and partial accumulations, must be continu-\nally taking place in different parts of the atmosphere, which will occasion winds varying in direction, violence, and continuance, according to the suddenness and the quantity of air destroyed or produced. Besides these, there are many other ingredients constantly mixing with the atmosphere, and many partial causes of condensation and rarefaction in particular places. To these, and probably to other causes hitherto unknown, are to be ascribed all those winds which blow in any place besides the general ones already explained; and which, as they depend on causes hitherto at least reckoned contingent, will probably for ever prevent uniformity and regularity in the winds. All these causes, however, may, and probably will, be discovered: the circumstances in which they will take place, and the effects they will produce, may be known; and whenever this is the case, the winds of any place may in some measure be reduced to calculation.\n\n**CHAP. V. Of Meteors.**\n\nThe principal luminous phenomena denominated meteors, have been fully considered under Atmospheric Electricity. Those meteors that burst in the air, and are followed by the falling of stones or other mineral substances, have been fully described and accounted for under Meteorolite. We have here only to notice briefly the meteors called falling stars, and ignis fatuus.\n\nThe falling or shooting star is a very common phenomenon, and takes place more especially at those seasons and in those situations where the aurora borealis is most frequently observed. Indeed they are considered by most philosophers as modifications of the same phenomenon, and depending on the same cause. We have good reason to conclude that the aurora borealis is an electrical meteor; and if the falling star is so nearly allied to the aurora as is supposed, it must also be produced by electricity. Mr G. Morgan seems to have no doubt of the electrical nature of this meteor, and remarks that if what appears as an undulating flash in the aurora, could be concentrated, or confined within smaller dimensions, it would probably assume the appearance of a falling star. He founds this opinion chiefly on the following experiment.\n\nInto a tube 48 inches long, and \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch diameter, Mr Morgan conveyed as much air, as under the common pressure of the atmosphere, would fill two inches in length of the same tube. (The tube we presume was previously exhausted of air.) One extremity of the tube he connected with the ground by means of good conductors, and fastened to the other a metallic ball. Through the tube thus filled with rarefied air, he sent electric sparks of different magnitudes, by bringing the ball within the striking distance of different fixed conductors. When the sparks were small, a flash like that of the aurora borealis, seemed to fill the whole tube; but when the spark was what might be made to strike through 10 inches in the open air, it appeared to strike through the whole length of the tube, with all the brilliancy and straightness of a falling star. If, however, he extracted part of the air out of the tube, by the air-pump, he could never make the electric fluid assume any form excepting that of a flash; but by exchanging the tube for another with a thermometrical ball, and treating it in the same manner as the preceding, the flash never appeared, but the fluid in its passage assumed all the brilliancy of a falling star.\n\nIt is easy to trace the similarity of circumstances that take place in this experiment, and in the natural phenomenon of the falling star. Both take place in rarefied air; both are remarkable for the brightness of their light, and for the straightness of their direction. That falling stars are frequently, if not always, the concentration of an aurora borealis, may be inferred from their being the constant attendants of a very electrical state of the atmosphere; and from their frequent appearance near that portion of the heavens which is illumined by the northern lights at the time of their appearance.\n\nMr Morgan was riding towards Norwich late at night, when to the north east of the town he beheld a fine conical stream of the aurora borealis. The whole body every now and then flashed, as if an additional quantity of electric fluid were thrown into it; and nearly at the same instant he perceived what is vulgarly called a falling star, darting from its summit. This appearance he observed twice successively.\n\nThe ignis fatuus, or will-with-the-wisp, that appears so often in boggy, marshy and damp situations, thus decoying the unwary traveller, and terrifying the superstitious vulgar, seems to be rather of a phosphoric than an electric nature, similar to the light which is emitted by stale fish, rotten wood, and other putrefactive substances. Sir Isaac Newton defined it to be a vapour shining without heat.\n\nA remarkable ignis fatuus was observed by Mr Derham, in some boggy ground, between two rocky hills. He was so fortunate as to be able to approach it within two or three yards. It moved with a brisk and delusive motion about a dead thistle, till a slight agitation of the air, occasioned, as he supposed, by his near approach to it, occasioned it to jump to another place; and as he approached, it kept flying before him. He was near enough to satisfy himself, that it could not be the shining of glow-worms or other insects\u2014it was one uniform body of light.\n\nM. Beccaria mentions two of these luminous appearances, which were frequently observed in the neighbourhood of Bologna, and which emitted a light equal to that of an ordinary faggot. Their motions were unequal, sometimes rising, and sometimes sinking towards the earth; sometimes totally disappearing, though in general they continued hovering about six feet from the ground. They differed in size and figure; and indeed, the form of each was fluctuating, sometimes floating like waves, and dropping sparks of fire. He was assured there was not a dark night in the whole year in which they did not appear; nor was their appearance at all affected by the weather, whether cold or hot, snow or rain. They have been known to change their colour from red to yellow; and generally grew fainter as any person approached, vanishing entirely when the observer came very near to them, and appearing again at some distance.\n\nDr Shaw also describes a singular ignis fatuus, which he saw in the Holy Land. It was sometimes globular, or in the form of the flame of a candle; and immediately afterwards spread itself so much, as to involve the whole company in a pale insensible light,\nWeather, and then was observed to contract itself again, and suddenly disappear. In less than a minute, however, it would become visible as before, and run along from one place to another; or would expand itself over more than three acres of the adjacent mountains. The atmosphere at this time was thick and hazy.\n\nAll these luminous appearances are probably owing to the extrication of hydrogen gas so slightly impregnated with phosphorus as to continue emitting a faint light, without producing that brilliant flash which follows the sudden extrication into the air, of the common phosphorated hydrogen gas obtained in the usual chemical experiment of throwing phosphuret of lime into water.\n\n**Chap. VI. Of the Application of Meteorology to Prognosticating the Weather.**\n\nIt has ever been a principal object among mankind, to foretell the changes of weather that are likely to follow particular appearances in the sky, among the heavenly bodies, &c.; and it has been often alleged, that in this respect the philosopher is far behind the husbandman and the shepherd. Were the former, however, to add to his scientific researches the observations to which the latter are indebted for their judgement of the weather, he would soon be far superior to them in this respect.\n\nDr Kirwan has lately endeavoured to discover probable rules for prognosticating the weather in different seasons, as far as regards this climate, from tables of observation alone; and from comparing a number of these observations made in England, from 1677 to 1789, he found,\n\n1. That when there has been no storm before or after the vernal equinox, the ensuing summer is generally dry, at least five times in six.\n\n2. That when a storm happens from an easterly point, either on the 19th, 20th, or 21st of May, the succeeding summer is generally dry four times in five.\n\n3. That when a storm arises on the 26th, 27th, or 29th of May (and not before), in any point, the succeeding summer is generally dry four times in five.\n\n4. If there be a storm at south-west or west-south-west on the 19th, 20th, 21st, or 22d of March, the succeeding summer is generally wet five times in six.\n\nIn this country winters and springs, if dry, are most commonly cold; if moist, warm; on the contrary, dry summers and autumns are usually hot, and moist summers cold. So that if we know the moistness or dryness of a season, we can judge pretty accurately of its temperature.\n\nFrom a table of the weather kept by Dr Rutty, in Dublin, for 41 years, Dr Kirwan endeavoured to calculate the probabilities of particular seasons being followed by others. Though his rules relate chiefly to the climate of Ireland, yet as probably there is not much difference between that island and Britain, in the general appearance of the seasons, we shall mention his conclusions here.\n\nIn 41 years there were six wet springs, 22 dry, and 13 variable; 20 wet summers, 16 dry, and five variable; 11 wet autumns, 11 dry, and 19 variable. A season according to Dr Kirwan, is counted wet, when it contains two wet months. In general, the quantity of rain which falls in dry seasons is less than five inches; in wet seasons more. Variable seasons are those in which there falls between 30 and 36 pounds, a pound being equal to .157637 of an inch.\n\nThe order in which the different seasons succeeded each other, was as in the following table:\n\n| Season                  | Times | Probability |\n|-------------------------|-------|-------------|\n| A dry spring            |       |             |\n| A wet spring            |       |             |\n| A variable spring       |       |             |\n| A dry summer            |       |             |\n| A wet summer            |       |             |\n| A variable summer       |       |             |\n| A dry spring and dry summer |   |             |\n| A dry spring and wet summer |   |             |\n| A wet spring and dry summer |   |             |\n| A wet spring and wet summer |   |             |\n| A wet spring and variable summer |   |             |\n| A dry spring and variable summer |   |             |\n| A variable spring and dry summer |   |             |\n| A variable spring and wet summer |   |             |\n| A variable spring and variable summer |   |             |\n\nHence Dr Kirwan deduced the probability of the Rules for kind of seasons which would follow others. This probability is expressed in the last column of the table, and is to be understood in this manner. The probability that...\nWeather. that a dry summer will follow a dry spring is $\\frac{4}{5}$; that a wet summer will follow a dry spring, $\\frac{3}{4}$; that a variable summer will follow a dry spring, $\\frac{2}{3}$, and so on.\n\nThis method of Dr Kirwan, if there is such a connection between the different seasons that a particular kind of weather in one has a tendency to produce a particular kind of weather in the next, as it is reasonable to expect from theory, may in time, by multiplying observations, come to a great degree of accuracy, and may at last, perhaps, lead to that great desideratum, a rational theory of the weather. As we wish to throw as much light as possible on this important subject, we shall add to these a few maxims, the truth of which has either been confirmed by long observation, or which the knowledge we have already acquired of the causes of the weather has established on tolerably good grounds.\n\n1. A moist autumn with a mild winter is generally followed by a cold and dry spring, which greatly retards vegetation. Such was the year 1741.\n\n2. If the summer be remarkably rainy, it is probable that the ensuing winter will be severe; for the unusual evaporation will have carried off the heat of the earth. Wet summers are generally attended with an unusual quantity of seed on the white thorn and dog-rose bushes. Hence the unusual fruitfulness of these shrubs is a sign of a severe winter.\n\n3. The appearance of cranes and birds of passage early in autumn announces a very severe winter; for it is a sign it has already begun in the northern countries.\n\n4. When it rains plentifully in May, it will rain but little in September, and vice versa.\n\n5. When the wind is south-west during summer or autumn, and the temperature of the air unusually cold for the season, both to the feeling and the thermometer, with a low barometer, much rain is to be expected.\n\n6. Violent temperatures, as storms or great rains, produce a sort of crisis in the atmosphere, which produces a constant temperature, good or bad, for some months.\n\n7. A rainy winter predicts a sterl year: a severe autumn announces a windy winter.\n\nTo the above we shall add the following maxims, drawn from observation, and with these shall conclude this article.\u2014Sea and fresh water-fowls, such as cormorants, sea-gulls, snipe-heron, &c. flying from sea, or the fresh waters, to land, show bad weather at hand: land fowls flying to waters, and these shaking, washing, and noisy, especially in the evening, denote the same; geese, ducks, cats, &c. picking, shaking, washing, and noisy; rooks and crows in flocks, and suddenly disappearing; pyes and jays in flocks, and very noisy; the raven or hooded-crow crying in the morning, with an interruption in their notes, or crows being very clamorous at even; the heron, bittern, and swallow lying low; birds forsaking their meat and flying to their nests; poultry going to roost, or pigeons to their dove-house; tame fowls grubbing in the dust, and clapping their wings; small birds seeming to duck and wash in the sand; the late and early crowing of the cock, and clapping his wings; the early ringing of wood-larks; the early chirping of sparrows; the early note of the chaffinch near houses; the dull appearance of robin-redbreast near houses; peacocks and owls unusually clamorous.\n\nSea and fresh-water fowls gathering in flocks to the banks, and there sporting, especially in the morning; birds wild-geese flying high, and in flocks, and directing their course eastward; coots restless and clamorous; the hoopoe loud in his note; the kingfisher taking to land; rooks darting or shooting in the air, or sporting on the banks of fresh waters; and lastly, the appearance of the malefigie at sea, is a certain forerunner of violent winds, and (early in the morning) denotes horrible tempests at hand.\n\nHalcyons, sea-ducks, &c. leaving the land and flocking to the sea; kites, herons, bitterns, and swallows flying high and loud in their notes; lapwings restless and clamorous; sparrows after sunrise restless and noisy; ravens, hawks, and kestrels (in the morning), loud in their notes; robin-redbreast mounted high, and loud in his song; larks soaring high, and loud in their songs; owls hunting with an easy and clear note; bats appearing early in the evening.\n\nAsses braying more frequently than usual; hogs playing, scattering their food, or carrying straw in their mouths; oxen sniffing the air, looking to the south, while lying on their sides, or licking their hoofs; cattle galloping for air at noon; calves running violently and gamboling; deer, sheep, or goats, leaping, fighting, or pushing; cats washing their face and ears; dogs eagerly scraping up earth; foxes barking, or wolves howling; moles throwing up earth more than usual; rats and mice more restless than usual; a grumbling noise in the belly of hounds.\n\nWorms crawling out of the earth in great abundance; spiders falling from their webs; flies dull and restless; ants hastening to their nests; bees hastening home, and keeping close in their hives; frogs and toads drawing nigh to houses; frogs croaking from ditches; toads crying on eminences; gnats fingering more than usual; but, if gnats play in the open air, or if hornets, wasps, and glow-worms appear plentifully in the evening, or if spiders webs are seen in the air, or on the grass, or trees, these do all denote fair and warm weather at hand.\n\nSun rising dim or watery; rising red with blackish beams mixed along with his rays; rising in a muzzy or muddy colour; rising red and turning blackish; setting under a thick cloud; setting with a red sky in the east.\n\nN.B. Sudden rains never last long; but when the air grows thick by degrees, and the sun, moon, and stars shine dimmer and dimmer, then it is like to rain six hours usually.\n\nSun rising pale and setting red, with an iris; rising large in surface; rising with a red sky in the north; setting of a bloody colour; setting pale, with one or more dark circles, or accompanied with red streaks; seeming concave or hollow; seeming divided, great storms; parhelia, or mock suns, never appear, but are followed by tempests.\n\nSun rising clear, having set clear the night before; rising while the clouds about him are driving to the west; rising with an iris around him; and that iris wearing away equally on all sides, then expect fair and settled weather; rising clear and not hot; setting in red clouds, according to the old observation:\n\nThe\nThe evening red and morning gray,\nIs the sure sign of a fair day.\n\nMoon pale in colour, rain; horns blunt at first rising, rain; horns blunt, at or within two or three days after the change, denotes rain for that quarter; an iris with a south wind, rain next day; wind south third night after change, rain next day; the wind south, and the moon not seen before the fourth night, rain most of that month; full moon in April, new and full moon in August, for most part bring rain; mock moons are the forerunners of great rains, land floods, and inundations.\n\nMoon seeming greatly enlarged; appearing of a red colour; horns sharp and blackish; if included with a clear and ruddy iris; if the iris be double or seem to be broken in parts, tempests.\n\nN.B. On the new moon, the wind for the most part changes.\n\nWhen the moon, at four days old, has her horns sharp, she foretells a tempest at sea, unless she has a circle about her, and that too entire, because, by that she shews that it is not like to be bad weather, till it is full moon.\n\nMoon seeming to exhibit bright spots; a clear iris with full moon; horns sharp fourth day, fair till full; horns blunt at first rising, or within two or three days after change, denotes rain for that quarter; but fair weather the other three quarters; moon clear three days after change and before full, always denotes fair weather. After every change and full, rains for the most part, succeeded by fair settled weather; moon clear and bright, always fair weather.\n\nStars seeming large, dull, and pale of colour, rain; or when their twinkling is not perceptible, or if encompassed within it is. In summer, when the wind is at east, and stars seem greater than usual, then expect sudden rain; stars appearing great in number, yet clear and bright, seeming to shoot or dart, denote fair weather in summer, and in winter frosts.\n\nIn cloudy weather, when the wind falls, rain follows; clouds growing bigger, or seeming like rocks or towers settling on tops of mountains; coming from the south, or often changing their course; many in number at north-west in the even; being black in colour from the east, rain at night; but out of the west, rain next day; being like fleece of wool, from the east, rain for two or three days; lying like ridges about mid day in the south-west, thaws great storms both of wind and rain to be nigh. Clouds flying to and fro; appearing suddenly from the south or west; appearing red, or accompanied with redness in the air, especially in the morning; being of a leadish colour in the north-west; single clouds denote wind from whence they come; but if at sunset, clouds appear with golden edges, or diminish in bulk, or small clouds sink low, or draw against the wind, or appear small, white, and scattered in the north-west (such as are vulgarly called mackerel) when the sun is high, there are signs of fair weather.\n\nN.B. It is often observed, that though the mackerel sky denotes fair weather for that day, yet for the most part, rain follows in a day or two after.\n\nAfter a long drought, the rainbow denotes sudden and heavy rains; if green be the predominant colour, it denotes rain, but if red, wind with rain; if the clouds grow darker, rain; if the bow seems broken, violent storms; if appearing at noon, much rain; if in the west great rain, with thunder.\n\nN.B. It is observed, that if the last week in February, and the first fortnight of March, be mostly rainy, and attended with frequent appearances of the bow, a wet spring and summer may be expected.\n\nThe rainbow appearing after rains, denotes fair weather at hand, if the colours grow lighter, fair; if the bow suddenly disappears, fair; if the bow appears in the morning, it is the sign of small rains, followed by fair weather; and if appearing at night, fair weather; if appearing in the east in the evening, fair; if the bow appear double, it denotes fair weather at present but rain in a few days; if in autumn, it continues fair for two days after the appearance of the aurora borealis, expect fair weather for at least eight days more.\n\nIf mists be attracted to the tops of hills then expect rain from rain in a day or two; if, in dry weather, they be observed to ascend more than usual, then expect sudden rain; mists in the new moon foretell rain in the old; mists also in the old moon denote rain to happen in the new; a milky white scare, in a clear sky in the south-east, is always a forerunner of rain.\n\nIf mists dissipate quickly, or descend after rain, it is a sure sign of fair weather; a general mist before sunrise near the full moon, denotes fair weather for about a fortnight running. If after sunset or before sunrise, a white mist arise from the waters and meads, it denotes warm and fair weather next day. A milky dew on the inside of glass windows thaws fair weather for that day.\n\nWood swelling, or stones seeming to sweat; lute or rain from violent strings breaking; printed canvas or panted maps animate relaxing; salt becoming moist; rivers linking, or floods bodies, suddenly abating; remarkable halo about the candle; great dryness of the earth; pools seeming troubled or muddy; yellow fum on the surface of stagnant waters; dandelion or pimpinella shutting up; trefoil dwelling in stalk, while the leaves bow down.\n\nN.B. A dry spring is always attended with a rainy winter.\n\nWind shifting to the opposite point; sea calm, with a wind from murmuring noise; a murmuring noise from the woods; and rocks when the air is calm; leaves and feathers seeming much agitated; tides high when the thermometer is high; trembling or flexuous burning of flames; coal burning white with a murmuring noise; thunder in the morning with a clear sky; thunder from the north.\n\nN.B. Whosoever the wind begins to shift, it will not rest till it come to the opposite point; and if the wind be in the north, it will be cold; if in the north-east colder; if in the south; it brings rain; but if in the south-west more rain.\n\nThe sudden cloathing of gaps in the earth; the remarkable rising of springs or rivers; if the rain begins an hour or two before sunrise it is like to be fair after sunrise; but if an hour or two after sunrise; it for the most part happens to continue all day and then to cease; when it begins to rain from the south with a high wind for two or three hours, and that the wind falls, and it still continues raining, it is then like to continue for 12 hours or more, and then to cease.\n\nN.B.\nN. B. These long rains seldom hold above 24 hours, or happen above once a year.\n\nA hasty shower after raging winds is a sure sign of the storm being near an end. If the water ripples and frequent bubbles arise, or if the halcyon or kingfisher attempts the sea while the storm lasts, or moles come out of their holes, or sparrows chirp merrily, these are all certain signs of the storm ceasing.\n\nBoth sea and fresh water fishes by their frequent rising and fluttering on the surface of the water, foretell the storm nigh over, but especially dolphins spouting up water in a storm foretell a calm.\n\nN. B. Let the wind be in what quarter it will, upon the new moon, it presently changes.\n\nClouds white, inclining to yellow, and moving heavily though the wind be high, is a sure sign of hail; if the eastern sky before sunrise be pale, and refracted rays appear in thick clouds, then expect great storms of hail; white clouds in summer are a sign of hail, but in winter they denote snow, especially when we perceive the air to be a little warm; in spring or winter, when clouds appear of blueish white, and expand much, expect small hail or drizzling, which properly is no other than frozen mists.\n\nMeteors shooting in the summer's evening, or chops and clefts in the earth, when the weather is sultry, always foretel thunder is nigh; in summer or harvest, when the wind has been south two or three days, and the thermometer high, and clouds rise with great white tops like towers, as if one were upon the top of another, and joined with black on the nether side, expect rain and thunder suddenly; if two such clouds arise, one on either hand, it is then time to look for shelter, as the thunder is very nigh.\n\nN. B. It is observed that it thunders most with a south wind and least with an east.\n\nSea-pyes, starlings, fieldfares, with other migratory birds, appearing early, denote a cold season to ensue; the early appearance of small birds in flocks, and of robin-redbreasts near houses; sun in harvest setting in a mist or broader than usual; moon bright, with sharp horns, after change; wind shifting to the east or north after change; sky full of twinkling stars; small clouds hovering low in the north; snow falling small, while clouds appear on heaps like rocks.\n\nN. B. Frosts in autumn are always succeeded with rain.\n\nSnow falling in large flakes while the wind is at south; cracks appearing in the ice; sun looking watery; the moon's horns blunted; stars looking dull; wind turning to the south; wind extremely shifting. It is also observed, that, if October and November be frost and snow, January and February are like to be open and mild.\n\nFair weather for a week together, while the wind is all that time in the south, is, for the most part, followed by a great drought; if February be for most rainy, signs of spring and summer quarters are like to be too; but drought, if it happen to be altogether fair, then expect a drought to follow; if lightning follow after 24 hours of dry and fair weather, drought will follow, but if within 24 hours, expect great rains.\n\nA moist and cold summer, and mild autumn, are signs of sure signs of a hard and severe winter; store of hips, hard wind, and haws denote the same; the hazel-tree flowering, is ever observed to foretel the same; acorns found without any insect is a sure prognostic of a hard winter.\n\nA dry and cold winter with a southerly wind; a sign of very rainy spring, sickness in summer; if summer be plentiful, dry with the wind northerly, great sickness is likely to follow; great heats in spring time without winds; roots having a lucious taste, while the wind has been long southerly without rain; and lastly, great quantities of flinting atoms, insects or animals, as flies, frogs, snakes, locusts, &c.\n\nInclofe the leech worm in an eight ounce phial experiments with a bit of linen; let the water be changed once a week in summer, and once a fortnight in winter.\n\nIf the leech lies motionless at the bottom in a spiral form, fair weather; if crept to the top, rain; if restless, wind; if very restless, and without the water, thunder; if in winter at bottom, frost; but if in the winter it pitches its dwelling on the mouth of the phial, snow. See HELMINTHOLOGY (f).\n\nIn calm weather, when the air is inclined to rain, the mercury is low; but when tending to fair, it will weather from the rise; in very hot weather when falling, it foretells thunder; if rising in winter, frost; but if falling in frost, thaw; if rising in a continued frost, snow; if foul weather quickly on its falling, soon over; if fair weather quickly on its rising, soon over; also if rising high in foul weather, and so continuing for two or three days, before the foul weather is over, then expect a continuance of fair weather; but, if in fair weather the mercury fall low, and so continue for two or three days, then expect much rain, and probably high winds.\n\nN. B. In an east wind, the mercury always rises and falls lowest before great winds.*\n\nIt was intended to insert in this article a summary view of the opinions of Toaldo, Cotte, and Lamarck, p. 149, respecting the influence of the moon in producing changes in our atmosphere; but peculiar circumstances render it necessary to postpone this view till we come to the article MOON.\n\n*Nicholson's Journal, Feb. 1804.","sp":312,"ep":341},{"h":"METEOROMANCY","t":"a species of divination by meteors, principally by lightning and thunder.

The Popish Methodists were those polemical doc-\nII. The Protestant Methodists form a very considerable body in this country. The sect was founded in the year 1729 by one Mr Morgan and Mr John Wesley. In the month of November that year, the latter being then fellow of Lincoln college, began to spend some evenings in reading the Greek New Testament, along with Charles Wesley student, Mr Morgan commoner of Christ church, and Mr Kirkham of Merton college. Next year two or three of the pupils of Mr John Wesley, and one pupil of Mr Charles Wesley, obtained leave to attend these meetings. Two years after they were joined by Mr Ingham of Queen's college, Mr Broughton of Exeter, and Mr James Hervey; and in 1735 they were joined by the celebrated Mr Whitefield, then in his 18th year.\n\nAt this time it is said that the whole kingdom of England was tending fast to infidelity. \"It is come (says Bishop Butler), I know not how, to be taken for granted by many persons, that Christianity is not so much as a subject of inquiry, but that it is now at length discovered to be fictitious; and accordingly they treat it as if in the present age there were an agreement among all people of discernment, and nothing remained but to set it up as a principal subject of mirth and ridicule, as it were by way of reprisals, for its having so long interrupted the pleasures of the world.\" The Methodists are said, with great probability, to have been very instrumental in stemming this torrent. They obtained their name from the exact regularity of their lives; which gave occasion to a young gentleman of Christ church to say, \"Here is a new set of Methodists sprung up;\" alluding to a sect of ancient physicians which went by that name. This extreme regularity, however, soon brought a charge against them, perhaps not altogether without foundation, of being too scrupulous, and carrying their sanctity to too great a height. In particular it was urged, that they laid too much stress upon the rubrics and canons of the church, inflicted too much on observing the rules of the university, and took the scriptures in too literal a sense; and to the name of Methodists two others were quickly added, viz. those of Sacramentarians and the Godly Club.\n\nThe principal person in this club while in its infancy appears to have been Mr Morgan, and next to him Mr John Wesley. They visited the sick, and instituted a fund for the relief of the poor; and the better to accomplish their benevolent designs, Mr Wesley abridged himself of all his superfluities, and even of some of the necessaries of life; and by proposing the scheme to some gentlemen, they quickly increased their funds to \u00a350 per annum. This, which one should have thought would have been attended with praise instead of censure, quickly drew upon them a kind of persecution; some of the seniors of the university began to interfere, and it was reported \"that the college censors were going to blow up the Godly Club.\"\n\nThey found themselves, however, patronised and encouraged by some men eminent for their learning and virtue; so that the society still continued, though they had suffered a severe loss in 1730 in the death of Mr Morgan, who had indeed been the founder of it. In the month of October 1735, John and Charles Wesley Methodists, Mr Ingham, and Mr D'lamotte set out for a merchant in London, embarked for Georgia along with Mr Oglethorpe, afterwards General Oglethorpe. The design of this voyage was to preach the gospel to the Indians. By this time, however, it appears that Mr Wesley had embraced such notions as may without the least breach of charity be accounted fanatical. Thus in a letter to his brother Samuel, he conjures him to banish from his school \"the classics with their poison, and to introduce instead of them such Christian authors as would work together with him in building up his flock in the knowledge and love of God.\"\n\nDuring the voyage such a profusion of worship was observed, as we cannot help thinking favoured more of a Pharisaical than Christian behaviour; an account of which, as a similar strictness would certainly be inculcated upon the disciples, and consequently must give a just idea of the principles of the early Methodists, we shall here transcribe from Mr Wesley's life. \"From four in the morning till five, each of us used private prayer; from five to seven we read the Bible together, carefully comparing it (that we might not lean to our own understandings) with the writings of the earliest ages; at seven we breakfasted; at eight were the public prayers; from nine to twelve learned the languages and instructed the children; at twelve we met to give an account to one another what we had done since our last meeting, and what we designed to do before our next; at one we dined; the time from dinner to four we spent in reading to those of whom each of us had taken charge, or in speaking to them separately as need required; at four were the evening prayers, when either the second lesson was explained (as it always was in the morning), or the children were catechised and instructed before the congregation; from five to six we again used private prayer; from six to seven I read in our cabin to two or three of the passengers, of whom there were about 80 English on board, and each of my brethren to a few more in theirs; at seven I joined with the Germans in their public service, while Mr Ingham was reading between decks to as many as desired to hear; at eight we met again, to instruct and exhort one another; between nine and ten we went to bed, when neither the roaring of the sea nor the motion of the ship could take away the refreshing sleep which God gave us.\"\n\nAs they proceeded in their passage, this austerity instead of being diminished was increased. Mr Wesley discontinued the use of wine and flesh; confining himself to vegetables, chiefly rice and biscuit. He ate no supper; and his bed having been made wet by the sea, he lay upon the floor, and slept soundly till morning. In his Journal he says, \"I believe I shall not find it needful to go to bed, as it is called, any more;\" but whether this was really done or not, we cannot say.\n\nThe missionaries, after their arrival, were at first very favourably received, but in a short time lost the affections of the people entirely. This was owing to the behaviour of Mr Wesley himself, who appeared not only capricious but frequently defective. He particularly gave offence by insisting upon the baptism of children by immersion; and his excessive austerity with regard to himself\nMethodists himself did not tend to give his hearers any favourable opinion either of the superior sanctity or wisdom of their teacher. At last, on account of a difference with Mr Caufton the storekeeper and chief magistrate of Savannah which ended in a law-suit, he was obliged to return to England.\n\nThus the cause of Methodism seemed to be entirely lost in Georgia. But Mr Wesley was soon succeeded by a more popular and successful champion, viz. Mr George Whitefield; who having spent his time during the voyage in converting the soldiers with whom he sailed, arrived at Savannah in Georgia on the 7th of May 1738. Here he was received by Mr Delamotte, was joined by several of Mr Wesley's hearers, and became intimate with some other ministers. Mr Ingham had made some progress in converting a few runaway Creek Indians, who had a settlement about four miles from Savannah; but being obliged to return to England in a few months, this design was frustrated, and the Indians in a few years separated. During the short time that Mr Whitefield resided at Savannah, he became extremely popular; and indeed the influence of his success in the way of making converts are very surprising. However, he was obliged to return to England in the autumn of that year, that he might receive priestly orders. On his return to America in October 1739, he landed at Philadelphia, and instantly began his spiritual labours as in other places; being attended with astonishing success not only there but wherever he went. Passing through the colonies of Virginia, Maryland, North and South Carolina, the number of converts continually increased; but on his arrival at Savannah, he found the colony almost deserted. He now resumed the scheme he had formerly projected of building an Orphan-house; and for this he made the first collection at Charlestown in South Carolina, amounting to about \u00a320 sterling. His zeal in the cause of religion, or of the colony, were not, however, sufficient to procure him the favour of those in power. On his return to Philadelphia, after a short stay at Savannah, the churches were denied him; but he was made ample amends by the success which attended his field preachings and private efforts. Religious societies were everywhere set up, and many were converted with symptoms of enthusiasm, different according to their various tempers and constitutions. During this excursion, he was so successful in his collection for the Orphan-house, that on his return to Savannah he brought along with him money and provisions to the value of \u00a3500 sterling.\n\nThe success in Georgia was now greater than ever; but the many charities which it was necessary to supply, rendered it necessary in a short time for him to undertake another journey to Charlestown. Here his principles met with the greatest opposition. He had lost the favour of the commissary by his field-preaching, and was denied the sacrament. The opposition, however, was altogether fruitless; the number of converts increased wherever he went, and he now undertook a voyage to New England. In this place also the established clergy were his enemies; but the usual success attended his other endeavours, and procured \u00a3500 more for the use of the orphans in Georgia.\n\nFrom the year 1741 to 1743 America was deprived of Mr Whitefield's preaching, he having spent that interval in England; but in 1744 he again set out for Methodists' western continent. The remarkable success which had hitherto attended his labours now stirred up many opponents; and these had met with the greater success, as none of the Methodist preachers whom he had left were possessed of such abilities either to gain the favour of those who heard them, or to defend their doctrines against objections. Mr Whitefield's success, however, was the same as before: he even found means to inspire the military class with such sentiments of devotion, that Colonel Pepperell could not undertake his expedition against Louisbourg without first consulting Mr Whitefield; and great numbers of New-Englanders went volunteers, confident of victory, in consequence of the discourses of their teacher.\n\nFrom the continent of America Mr Whitefield took a voyage to the Bermudas islands; and here, as everywhere else, he met with the most surprising success. Here also collections were made for the Orphan-house in Savannah, which were transmitted to that place.\n\nSupposing it to be better for his cause to visit different countries, than to take up a permanent residence in one, Mr Whitefield left Bermudas in a few months, and did not return to America till 1751, when the Orphan-house was found to be in a very flourishing situation. After a short stay, he set sail again for Britain. Here he remained two years, and then set out on another visit to America, landing at Charlestown on the 27th of May 1754. His presence constantly revived the spirits and cause of his party, and added to their numbers wherever he went. Next year he returned to England; but after labouring in the usual manner, and meeting with the usual success there till the year 1763, he set sail again for America, and arrived at Virginia in the latter end of August. He now visited all the colonies, and found that great progress had been made in converting the Indians. On his arrival at Georgia, matters were found in a very flourishing situation, and he received the thanks of the governor and principal people for the great benefit he had been to the colony; which shows, that the stories which had been so industriously propagated, concerning the avarice of him and other Methodist preachers, were, partly at least, unfounded. In 1765 he returned to England; and in 1766 made his seventh and last voyage to America, landing at Charlestown on the 30th of November the same year. He was still attended with the same success; and indeed it is impossible to read, without admiration, an account of the efforts made by himself and Mr Wesley, to propagate their tenets in the different parts of the world.\n\nFor a very considerable time Mr Whitefield was the only Methodist who paid any attention to America; and in that country he was more popular than even in Europe. Towards the end of his life, several Methodists having emigrated from Britain, formed distinct societies in New York and Philadelphia. These quickly increased in number; and, about the time that the war with Britain began, their numbers amounted to about 3000 in Virginia, Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania. They would probably have increased much more, had it not been for the imprudence of some of their preachers, who intro-\nintroduced politics into their discourses, and thus rendered themselves obnoxious to the people among whom they lived. Among those who hurt the cause in this manner was Mr Wesley himself, who, by writing a piece entitled A Calm Address to the American Colonies, would in all probability have ruined it, had not a gentleman, with whom he was connected, destroyed or sent back to England the whole impression as soon as it arrived in America, so that its existence was scarce known in that continent. At the conclusion of the war, Dr Coke, who in 1776 had left a curacy in England in order to join Mr Wesley, paid a visit to his friends in America; though it had been imagined that a total separation had taken place between the American and European Methodists. This breach was, however, made up by a manoeuvre of Mr Wesley; for no sooner had the Americans obtained their independence, than he, who had hitherto branded them with the name of rebels, sent a congratulatory letter on their freedom from the \"State and the Hierarchy,\" and exhorting them to \"stand fast in that liberty with which God had so strangely made them free.\" To show his zeal in their service still farther, he gave ordination, by laying on of hands, to several preachers who were to embark for America, and consecrated Dr Coke one of the bishops of the Methodist Episcopal church in that country. He extracted also from the liturgy of the English church one for the American Methodists, taking particular care to expunge every expression that had a particular respect to the regal authority.\n\nSuch proceedings in one who had formerly professed such extraordinary attachment to the English church, could not but require an apology; and this was accordingly made in a pastoral letter transmitted to the American societies, and addressed \"To Dr Coke, Mr Atbury, and our brethren in North America.\" In this letter he makes the following defence of his conduct. \"Lord King's account of the primitive church convinced me, many years ago, that bishops and presbyters are the same order, and consequently have the same right to ordain. For many years I have been importuned, from time to time, to exercise this right, by ordaining part of our travelling preachers. But I have still refused, not only for the sake of peace, but because I was determined, as little as possible, to violate the established order of the national church to which I belonged. But the case is widely different between England and North America. Here there are bishops who have a legal jurisdiction; in America there are none, neither any parish ministers: so that for some hundred miles together, there is none either to baptize, or to administer the Lord's supper. Here, therefore, my scruples are at an end; and I conceive myself at full liberty, as I violate no order, and invade no man's right, by appointing and sending labourers into the harvest. It has indeed been proposed to define the English bishops to ordain part of our preachers for America; but to this I object. 1. I desired the bishop of London to ordain only one, but could not prevail. 2. If they consented, we know the looseness of their proceedings; but the matter admits of no delay. 3. If they would ordain them now, they would likewise expect to govern them; and how grievously would that entangle us. 4. As our American brethren are now to tally disentangled, both from the state and the English hierarchy, we dare not entangle them again either with the one or the other. They are now at full liberty simply to follow the scripture and the primitive church; and we judge it best, that they should stand fast in that liberty wherewith God has so strangely made them free.\"\n\nDr Coke, on the consecration of Mr Atbury to the office of a bishop, made another apology. \"The church of England (says he), of which the society of Methodists in general have till lately professed themselves a part, did for many years groan in America under grievances of the heaviest kind. Subjected to a hierarchy which weighs everything in the scale of politics, its most important interests were repeatedly sacrificed to the supposed advantages of England. The churches were in general filled with the parasites and bottle-companions of the rich and great. The humble and most unfortunate entreaties of the oppressed flocks, yea the representations of a general assembly itself, were contemned and despised. Everything sacred must bow down at the feet of a party; the holiness and happiness of mankind be sacrificed to their views; and the drunkard, the fornicator, and the extortioner, triumphed over bleeding Zion, because they were faithful abettors of the ruling powers. The memorable revolution has struck off these intolerable fetters, and broken the anti-christian union which before subsisted between church and state. And had there been no other advantage arising from that glorious epoch, this itself, I believe, would have made ample compensation for all the calamities of the war; one happy consequence of which was the expulsion of most of those hirelings, who \"ate the fat, and clothed themselves with the wool, but strengthened not the diseased,\" &c. The parochial churches in general being hereby vacant, our people were deprived of the sacraments through the greatest part of these states, and continue so still. What method can we take in so critical a juncture? God has given us sufficient resources in ourselves; and, after mature deliberation, we believe that we are called to draw them forth.\n\n\"But what right have you to ordain?\" The same right as most of the churches in Christendom; our ordination, in its lowest view, being equal to any of the presbyterian, as originating with three presbyters of the church of England. \"But what right have you to exercise the episcopal office?\" To me the most manifest and clear. God has been pleased to raise me, by Mr Wesley, in America and Europe, a numerous society well known by the name of Methodists. The whole body have invariably esteemed this man as their chief pastor under Christ. He has constantly appointed all their religious officers from the highest to the lowest, by himself or his delegate. And we are fully persuaded there is no church office which he judges expedient for the welfare of the people intrusted to his charge, but, as essential to his station, he has power to ordain. \"But, do not you break the succession?\" The uninterrupted succession of bishops is a point that has long been given up by the most able Protestant defenders of episcopacy. Bishop Hoadley himself, in his celebrated controversy with Dr Calamy, allows it to be unnecessary. His words are, \"To the 13th question I answer, that I think not an uninterrupted line of succession...\"\nMethodists, cession of regularly ordained bishops necessary.' He also grants the authenticity of the anecdote given us by St Jerome, which informs us, that the church of Alexandria had no regular succession from the time of St Mark the evangelist, the first bishop of that church, to the time of Dionysius, a space of 200 years; but the college of presbyters, on the death of a bishop, elected another in his stead. We are also informed, from the epistle of St Clement to the Corinthians, written soon after the death of St Paul, a writer whose works are next in precedence to the canons of scripture, and probably written by immediate inspiration, that the church of Corinth was then governed only by a college of presbyters. And from the epistle of Polycarp to the church of Philippi, written in 116, we also find that the Christian Philippians were then governed only by a college of presbyters. So that the primitive Christians were so far from esteeming the regular succession as essential to the constitution of a Christian church, that, in some instances, episcopacy itself was wholly omitted.\n\nSuch was the defence urged by Mr Wesley for this extraordinary assumption of episcopal powers: a conduct, however, of which he afterwards repented, as tending to make a final separation between his followers and the church of England. Yet it does not appear that this had any bad effect on the minds of his American brethren; for Dr Coke, on his arrival on the western continent, found the societies numerous and flourishing. His first efforts were directed against the slave trade; and not only the abolition of that traffic, but the release of all those who were actually slaves at the time, seem to have been his favourite objects. By interfering in this matter, however, perhaps with too much zeal, he involved himself in danger. Some riots took place, and a lady offered the mob 50 guineas if they would give the Doctor 100 lashes. This piece of discipline would have been inflicted, had it not been for the intervention of a sturdy colonel; and the Doctor had not only the satisfaction of escaping the intended punishment, but of seeing his doctrine so far attended to, that some slaves were emancipated.\n\nMr Hanlon, in his Memoirs of Mr Wesley, observes, that \"the colonists, in the infancy of Methodism, conducted themselves with more propriety than the English. There was little or no persecution, nor anything like a riot, except in one or two instances which have been mentioned as the consequence of the anti-slavery laws; and even these were productive of no mischief. Not a creature was materially injured; no bones were broken, nor any lives lost; which was not the case in this country. Here many thousands of innocent people were subjected to the grossest indignities, and several were eventually sacrificed to the fury of their persecutors.\n\n\"While we commend the Americans for their behaviour in opposition to the brutality of English mobs, it may be proper to inquire into the sources of this distinction. Something of this may have arisen from similarity of sentiment. The Americans, from the first beginnings of colonization, had been accustomed to the doctrines of the old puritans and nonconformists, which in many respects have a near affinity to the Methodist tenets. The origin of Methodism in America was seldom, if ever, attended, either under the discourses of Mr Whitefield's or Mr Wesley's preachers, with those ridiculous effects with which it was accompanied in these kingdoms. Most of the preachers, who went over to the continent, having laboured for some years in Europe previous to their having crossed the water, had exhausted their wildfire; so that their discourses were more scriptural and rational than those of the primitive Methodists. Another reason may be found in the education of the Americans. As a people, they are better cultivated than the body of the English; they are chiefly composed of merchants and respectable yeomanry; and there is but a small proportion of that class, so superabundant here, which we distinguish by the name of mob.\n\n\"The only exception we have heard, to their exemption from the extravagancies which in this country marked the infancy of Methodism, is a custom they have introduced in Maryland and Virginia. Frequently, at the conclusion of a sermon, the whole congregation begin to pray and to praise God aloud. The uproar which this must create may easily be conceived. Some are told, are great admirers of this species of enthusiasm, in which every man is his own minister, and one sings and another prays, with the most discordant devotion. But we will not dignify such indecency with such a name. Its proper appellation is fanaticism. We hope, that, for the future, religion will never appear in this country under so odious a form; and greatly is it to be lamented, that, among the friends of Christianity, any such affinities should arise, to furnish infidels with occasions of triumph.\"\n\nOur author informs us, that the occupation of the Methodist preachers in America was very laborious. In the course of the day they frequently rode 20 or 30 miles, preaching twice or thrice, and sometimes to considerable congregations. Notwithstanding this labour, however, few or none of them ever thought of returning to Britain. Several reasons may be assigned for the pleasure they took in this laborious exercise. \"Their excursions (says Mr Hanlon) through immense forests abounding in trees of all sorts and sizes, were often highly romantic. Innumerable rivers and falls of water; vistas opening to the view, in contrast with the uncultivated wild; deer now shooting across the road, and now scurrying through the woods, while the eye was frequently relieved by the appearance of orchards and plantations, and the houses of gentlemen and farmers peeping through the trees; formed a scenery so various and picturesque, as to produce a variety of reflection, and present, we will not say to a philosophic eye, but to the mind of every reasonable creature, the most sublime and agreeable images.\n\n\"Their worship partook of the general simplicity. It was frequently conducted in the open air. The woods resounded to the voice of the preacher, or to the singing of his numerous congregations; while their horses, fastened to the trees, formed a singular addition to the solemnity. It was indeed a striking picture; and might naturally impress the mind with a retrospect of the antediluvian days, when the hills and valleys re-echoed the patriarchal devotions, and a Seth or an Enoch, in the shadow of a projecting rock, or beneath the foliage...\"\nMethodists of some venerable oak, delivered his primeval lectures, and was a \"preacher of righteousness to the people.\"\n\nThe American hospitality is supposed by Mr Hanson to have been another reason for the affluence of the Methodist teachers, as well as the consciousness of being well employed, and the satisfaction resulting from considerations of public utility. As many of the preachers were men of fervent piety, this reflection would have its full weight; and the instruction of the ignorant and the reformation of the profligate would be considered as the best recompense of their labours. Spreading themselves through the continent, they took in Nova Scotia, Georgia, with the principal places in both Carolinas, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York; numbering upwards of 43,000 members of their society, exclusive of about 80 itinerants, and a considerable number of local preachers, who took no circuits, but assisted occasionally in the neighbourhood of their respective residence.\n\nThe large and expensive buildings which the colonists have erected for public worship, almost exceed credibility; and several colleges are founded for the instruction of youth. How far the proposed plan of uniting genuine religion and extensive learning will be carried into execution, time only can discover. It must materially depend on the character of the presidents and tutors, and the provision that shall be made for their support. Men of real erudition will never be procured at low salaries; and it is in vain to attempt establishments of this sort without a liberal provision for the professors in every branch of science. Two of these places are called Cokebury and Wesley Colleges. How they are endowed, or whether they propose to obtain authority to confer degrees, we are not informed. But perhaps they are rather schools than colleges; which indeed is a circumstance to be wished, as good grammar schools are of the utmost service to the progress of literature.\n\nThe great success which attended the Methodist preachers in America naturally determined Mr Wesley to try the West India islands. The Moravians had already attempted to establish their principles in some of these islands; and in 1786 some preachers were sent from the Methodists in England to the West Indies. In many of these they met with success. Societies were formed in Barbadoes, St Vincent's, Dominica, St Christopher's, Nevis, Antigua, St Eustatius, Tortola, and St Croix, amounting in all to near 5000 persons. At this time the whole number of Methodists in America and the West Indies amounted to about 48,302. These societies consisted both of whites and blacks; on the continent they were mostly whites, but in the islands negroes. \"But it is to be observed (says Mr Hanson) that the subjection of the negroes, and the obedience in which they are trained, must inculcate a docility peculiarly favourable to the purposes of a mission.\" Some of the missionaries went also to St Vincent's, where they met with some success, and have established some schools, in which their children are carefully instructed in the principles of religion.\n\n\"In January 1789 (says our author), Dr Coke paid a visit to Jamaica, and gave them several sermons. As he made but a short stay, it could hardly be considered as a fair trial. Should a mission be established here, as well as in the other islands, which will probably be the case, it is hoped it will be the means of correcting one vice at least, and that is duelling; a savage relic of Gothic barbarity, by which all the islands have for many years been distinguished. Perhaps too it will give some check to the spirit of luxury and dissipation; and teach the planters, if it be found impracticable to emancipate their slaves, at least to treat them with humanity.\"\n\nIt has been debated among the leading men of the Methodistical profession, whether the cause might not be served by sending missionaries to the East Indies and to Africa; but these projects were dropped, as there was no invitation, nor any prospect of success if it had been adopted. A mission has been formed to the new settlement called Kentucky, on the confines of the Indian territories, near the Mississippi. The danger of the missionaries at the time they undertook this service was certainly very great; yet such was their zeal for the cause, that they voluntarily offered themselves; but we are not yet informed what success they have met with.\n\nWhile Methodism was thus making rapid progress in America, its teachers were equally indefatigable in Britain. A most remarkable particular, however, occurs with regard to Mr Wesley himself; for though he had gone to Georgia, as has been already related, to convert the Indians to Christianity, yet on his return to England in 1738, he took it into his head that he, their teacher, was not yet converted: the reason was, that he had not the faith of assurance. This, however, was not long wanting. He arrived in England on the first day of February, and was blest with the assurance on the sixth of March following. This was immediately announced to the public; and the consequence, if we may believe him, was, that God then began to work by his ministry, which he had not done before. Being joined by one Kinchin, a fellow of Corpus, they travelled to Manchester, Holms Chapel, Newcastle in Staffordshire, and other places, where they preached, exhorted, and conversed on religious subjects, in public houses, stables, &c., sometimes meeting with success and sometimes not. During this peregrination Mr Wesley certainly displayed a great deal of superstition, which he must undoubtedly suppose to have been communicated to his hearers, and to have caused them act on many occasions in a very ridiculous manner. An instance follows:\n\n\"The next day (says he), March 11th, we dined at Birmingham, and, soon after we left it, were reproved for our negligence there (in letting those who attended us go without either exhortation or instruction) by a severe shower of hail!\" About the latter end of March or beginning of April he and his companion began to pray extempore, leaving off entirely the forms of the church of England, to which he had formerly been so devoted. The doctrine of instantaneous conversion, which his imagination had suggested to him as a work performed on himself, was greedily received by some of his hearers; and all the converts to the new doctrine confirmed themselves, and contributed greatly to persuade others, by declarations of their experiences, as they called them: how-\nMethodists, ever, though a knowledge of the saving assurance had been given on March 6th, he does not date his conversion sooner than May 24th of the same year.\n\nThis new doctrine of an instantaneous, and in fact miraculous impulse, though greatly relished by the enthusiastic part of the society, was very much disliked by others, particularly Mr Charles Wesley his brother, who warned him of the mischief he was doing; though he himself was soon converted, and, what is very astonishing, two days before John Wesley himself. The particulars related of these miraculous conversions are truly disgraceful, and could not but bring into contempt the society which consisted of such enthusiasts. \"Many (says Mr Hanson) are represented as falling suddenly to the ground, in horror and agony not to be conceived, and rising again with equal expressions of peace and consolation.\"\n\nTheir conversions were usually attended with these violent symptoms; and, for several years, few meetings occurred where Mr Wesley presided, without one or more instances of the same kind. It was not possible that such translations should pass without notice. The confusion that too often prevailed, the emotions of the persons affected, and the exultations of the rest, which were feverishly animated upon, gave great and general offence. Many insisted, that it must either be occasioned by the heat of the rooms, and the agitation of the animal spirits under discourses of the most alarming nature; or that it was mere artifice and hypocrisy.\n\nIn the meantime, two of the sons of a Mrs Hutton in London, happening to become converts to the new doctrine, this lady was so much offended, that she wrote to Mr Samuel Wesley, informing him, that she was of opinion his brother John had lost his senses; and requesting, that the next time he came to his house, he, Mr Samuel, would either confine or convert him. All that could be done, however, to prevent the progress of the new doctrine was insufficient; and the first Methodist society was formed in London on the first of May 1738, when about 50 agreed to meet together once a week, for free conversation, begun and ended with singing and prayer.\n\nAll this time, however, it seems that the conversion of Mr Wesley was far from being so complete as that of many of his hearers. He had preached and converted others, while he himself was absolutely unconverted. The knowledge of the true saving faith was only revealed to him on the 6th of March, and he did not experience its power till the 24th of May; and even after this, his doubts and fears were still so great, that on the 13th of June he undertook a voyage to Germany, where, in the company of Count Zinzendorff, his faith seems to have been thoroughly confirmed.\n\nOn Mr Wesley's return, September 16th, 1738, he applied himself with the greatest fidelity and success to the propagation of his doctrine. Multitudes of converts were made in various parts of the kingdom; and the reproaches poured upon him by his opponents, seemed to have rendered his zeal more fervent if possible than before. It is remarkable, however, that some of his old friends were now so much offended with his conduct or his principles, that they absolutely refused to keep company with him. His original plan seems to have been, to make an union of Methodists, clergymen, and disseminate his principles by their means. But in this he succeeded so ill, that in a letter written in 1742, he wished for a clerical assistant, were he only in deacons orders: but adds, \"I know of none such, who is willing to call in his lot with us; and I scarce expect I shall, because I know how fast they are riveted in the service of the devil and the world before they leave the university.\"\u2014Finding at last that nothing could be done with them, he was obliged to have recourse to lay preachers; and easily selected those who appeared to have the greatest talents for prayer and exhortation in the private meetings appointed for that purpose. Thus he at once raised himself to be the head of a sect; as the lay preachers willingly yielded obedience to him who had the advantages of superior learning and abilities, and was besides in orders as a clergyman; and this obedience he did not fail on every occasion to exact.\n\nIf his doctrine had formerly given offence to the established clergy, the appointment of lay preachers was reckoned much worse; and their being appointed without any form of ordination whatever, which almost all of them were, subjected them to contempt and reproach, which their want of learning, and very often of natural abilities, did not contribute to remove. Thus finding the churches flat against him and his followers, he was obliged to preach in the fields, and made his first essay in this way on the second of April 1739, in the neighbourhood of Bristol; Mr Whitesfield having set him an example the day before.\n\nThe success of those ignorant and itinerant preachers, with their absurd and uncharitable discourses and behaviour, so provoked their adversaries, that a persecution was soon commenced against them. Mr Wesley himself was calumniated in the harshest manner, being sometimes said to be a Jesuit, sometimes an illiterate enthusiast, as the people took it into their heads. Many pretended to answer him in writing, without being able to do so: the consequence was, that their deficiency of argument was supplied by invective, and the most scandalous performances made their appearance. Some of the English clergy so far forgot themselves as to infligate the mob against them, and the most cruel outrages were committed upon them in various places. For some time the persecuted party adhered to the doctrines of passive obedience and nonresistance, which their inhuman adversaries did not fail to take the advantage of.\u2014The less they were opposed, the more insolent they became. The Methodists were frequently in danger of their lives. Men, women with child, and even children, were knocked down and abused with the same undistinguishing fury. Houses were stripped of their furniture, vast quantities of furniture carried off, featherbeds cut in pieces and strewn over the streets, several reputable people were forced into the army, &c. To the disgrace of magistracy also it was found, that when application was made to the justices of the peace, redress was commonly denied; nor was a stop put to these shameful proceedings without a royal mandate for the purpose.\n\nFrom the year 1738 to 1747 Mr Wesley and his itinerants were employed in various parts of England.\nMethodists. In 1747 he went over to Dublin, where a society had been formed by one Mr Williams a clergyman.\u2014Here they proved so successful, notwithstanding the number of Papists, and the violence of their other opponents, that in 1750 they had erected meeting-houses in every part of the kingdom, and had formed 29 circuits, which employed 67 itinerants, besides a considerable number of local preachers. An invitation was given to Mr Wesley, in 1751, to visit Scotland, by an officer in quarters at Muirfieldburgh. He accordingly took a journey thither the same year; but left the place, after preaching in it once or twice. In 1753 he returned to Scotland, and visited Glasgow. Societies were at length formed in that city, as well as at Edinburgh, Dundee, Aberdeen, Inverness, and a few other places: but his success was by no means equal to what it had been in other parts; for in 1790 the number of circuits in Scotland was no more than eight, which were supplied by 20 itinerants.\n\nMr Whitefield, the other great labourer in the vineyard, was equally indefatigable, and probably more successful than Mr Wesley. Before entering into orders, he had formed a society of religious persons at Gloucester; here he preached his first sermon on the Necessity and Benefit of Religious Society; here he became extremely popular, as well as at Bristol and London, while preparing to set sail for Georgia for the first time; and in all places to which he came, large collections were made for the poor. He maintained the same doctrine with Mr Wesley as to the new birth; which likewise gave offence to the clergy when delivered by him, as it had done with Mr Wesley. In the various intervals of his voyages to America, he employed himself with the very same affluence in Britain and in Ireland, which we have already taken notice of in the western continent. His success was everywhere prodigious. In 1741 he was invited to Scotland, and preached his first sermon there at Dunfermline. From thence he went to Edinburgh, and preached in several of the established churches, but differed with Messrs Ralph and Ebenezer Erskine; so that he, as well as Mr Wesley, proved unsuccessful in forming a coalition with any other religious party. In the private way, however, his success was very considerable, at Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee, and other places. In 1742 he paid a second visit to Scotland, and a third one in 1748. In 1751 he visited Ireland for the first time; and preached to great multitudes, without being molested, even in places where others had been mobbed. From thence he returned to Scotland the same year, and speaks in very favourable terms of the attention the people there paid to their Bibles. In 1752 and 1753 he again visited the same kingdom, and the last time distinguished himself by preaching against the playhouse in Glasgow. In 1756 he returned; and by his animated discourses at Edinburgh against Popery and arbitrary power, was owned to have contributed very much to the increase of courage and loyalty in this country. Next year he again visited the Scottish capital during the time that the General Assembly sat, and his sermons were attended by several of the members. At Glasgow he made a large collection for the poor of that city, and from thence took a voyage to Ireland. He was received with the usual Methodist affection by the lower classes of Protestants; but the Popish rabble, exasperated at his success, almost murdered him with stones. After passing through a great part of Ireland, visiting England and Wales, he paid another visit to Scotland, where four clergymen now lent him their pulpits. His last visit was in the summer of 1758, when his congregations were as large as ever; and it is to his endeavours principally that we are to ascribe the great number of Methodist societies now existing in Scotland.\n\nWith regard to the religious principles of the Methodists, we cannot enter into any particular detail; neither indeed are there any doctrines peculiar to all included under that name, except the single one of universal redemption. In March 1741, Mr Whitefield being returned to England, entirely separated from Mr Wesley, and his friends, \"because he did not hold the &c. decrees.\"\u2014Here was the first breach, which warm men persuaded Mr Whitefield to make, merely for a difference of opinion. Those indeed who believed universal redemption, had no desire at all to separate; but those who held particular redemption, would not hear of any accommodation, being determined to have no fellowship with men that \"were in such dangerous errors.\" So there were now two sorts of Methodists so called; those for particular, and those for general, redemption.\n\nNot many years passed, before William Cudworth and James Relly separated from Mr Whitefield.\u2014These were properly Antinomians, absolute avowed enemies to the law of God, which they never preached or professed to preach, but termed all legalists who did. With them, preaching the law was an abomination. They had nothing to do with the law. They would preach Christ, as they called it; but without one word either of holiness or good works. Yet these were still denominated Methodists, although differing from Mr Whitefield both in judgement and practice, abundantly more than Mr Whitefield did from Mr Wesley.\n\nIn the mean time, Mr Venn and Mr Romaine began to be spoken of: and not long after Mr Madan and Mr Berridge, with a few other clergymen, who, although they had no connexion with each other, yet preaching salvation by faith, and endeavouring to live accordingly, to be Bible Christians, were soon included in the general name of Methodists. And so indeed were all others who preached salvation by faith, and appeared more serious than their neighbours. Some of these were quite regular in their manner of preaching: some were quite irregular, (though not by choice; but necessity was laid upon them, they must preach irregularly, or not at all): and others were between both; regular in most, though not in all particulars.\n\nIn 1762, George Bell and a few other persons began to speak great words. In the latter end of the year they foretold that the world would be at an end on the 28th of February. Mr Wesley, with whom they were then connected, withstood them both in public and private. This they would not endure: so, in January and February 1763, they separated from him, under the care of Mr Maxfield, one of Mr Wesley's preachers. But still Mr Maxfield and his adhe rents,\nMethodists rents, even the wildest enthusiasts among them, go under the general name of Methodists, and so bring a scandal upon those with whom they have no connexion.\n\nAt present, those who remain with Mr Wesley are mostly Church of England men. They love her articles, her homilies, her liturgy, her discipline, and unwillingly vary from it in any instance. Mean time, all who preach among them declare, we are all by nature children of wrath, but by grace we are saved through faith: saved from both the guilt and from the power of sin. They endeavour to live according to what they preach, to be plain Bible Christians; and they meet together at convenient times, to encourage one another therein. They tenderly love many that are Calvinists, though they do not love their opinions. Yea, they love the Antinomians themselves; but it is with a love of compassion only, for they hate their doctrines with a perfect hatred; they abhor them as they do hell fire: being convinced nothing can so effectually destroy all faith, all holiness, and all good works.\n\nWe shall conclude this article with the words of Mr Hanson, which must certainly be accounted just, whatever objections may be made to some parts of the principles or behaviour of the Methodists. \"If they possess not much knowledge, which, however, we do not know to be the case, it is at least certain, they are not deficient in zeal: and without any passionate desire to imitate their example, we may at least commend their endeavours for the general good. Every good man will contemplate with pleasure the operation of the spirit of reformation, whether foreign or domestic; and will rejoice in every attempt to propagate Christianity in the barbarous parts of the world. An attempt which, if in any tolerable degree successful, will do infinitely more for their civilization and happiness, than all the united energies of those boasted benefactors of mankind, the philosophic infidels.\"\n\nThe minutes of the last conference of the Methodists held at Leeds in August, 1806, represent the numbers of that society to be as follows:\n\n| Location                  | Number       |\n|---------------------------|--------------|\n| Great Britain             | 110,803      |\n| Ireland                   | 23,773       |\n| Gibraltar                 | 40           |\n| Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland | 1,418       |\n| West Indies, whites 1775, coloured people | 13,165       |\n| United States, whites 95,628, coloured people | 14,940       |\n|                           | 24,316       |\n| Total                     | 119,945      |\n\nMethodists (Methodici), in the history of medicine, a sect of ancient physicians, who reduced the whole art of healing to a few common principles or appearances.

According to Quincy, the Methodists (Methodici) are those physicians who adhere to the doctrine of Galen, and the schools; and who cure with bleeding, purges, &c., duly applied according to the symptoms, circumstances, &c. in opposition to empirics and charlatans, who use violent medicines, and pretended secrets or nostrums.","sp":343,"ep":351},{"h":"METHUSELAH","t":"the son of Enoch and father of Lamech, was born in the year of the world 687, begat Lamech in 874, and died in 1656, being the very year of the deluge, at the age of 969, which is the greatest age that has been attained to by any mortal man upon earth (Gen. v. 21, 22, &c.).

He early discovered a fondness for polite literature and the sciences; and went to study law at Orleans with the son of Barneveldt, whom he accompanied in his travels. In 1610 he was made professor of history at Leyden, and afterwards Greek professor. In the following year, the magistrates of the United Provinces proved how high their opinion was of his abilities, by fixing on him to write the history of his country. Meurinus married in the year 1612. His wife, Anna Catherina Bilberbeccia, descended from a very ancient and noble family in Angermund a city of Pomerania, possessed many amiable qualities, and rendered his domestic life remarkably happy, while he discharged the duties of his professorship with an assiduity equal to his abilities. At the same time the republic of letters did not lose the advantages to be derived from his labours; for during the fourteen years of his residence at Leyden, the works which he published were more numerous than those which had been presented to the world by the whole body of professors from the original foundation of the university in 1575.\n\nMeurinus's writings had now spread his reputation in every part of Europe; nor was the fame of his diligence and talents as a professor less known. In so high a rank, indeed, did he stand among his literary contemporaries, that Christian IV, king of Denmark conferred on him the place of historiographer royal, and invited him to undertake the professorship of history and politics in the academy of Sora, which was founded by King Frederick II., although the revival of its honours and dignities may be dated from this period, when it seemed to be again founded under the auspices of Christian IV. Meurinus and his family left Leyden in the year 1635. On his arrival at Sora, he was received with the most friendly tokens of regard by his majesty and the Danish nobility, and more particularly by Chancellor Rolenkrantz, on whom he has bestowed very ample praises in one of his letters. Here he resided, equally beloved and admired, for above twelve years. His pupils were not very numerous, but his exertions never relaxed. Those hours likewise which were not devoted to the duties of his professorship, he employed in reviling the works of the ancients and in philological disquisitions.\n\nHis health did not suffer by the intenseness of application, till in the year 1638 he had a violent attack of the stone, from which disorder he had suffered severely. In a letter to Voissius he thus describes his melancholy condition: \"The state of my health during the whole of the last winter has been truly deplorable. My sufferings from the stone have been really\nMeurifus really dreadful. I have voided so many, that the repeated discharges brought on a wound which emitted blood for above four months. I was next attacked by a tertian fever, which increased constantly, and produced an universal latitude of body, a dejection of spirits, and a total loss of appetite. But, thank heaven, I have now in some measure recovered my strength, and gotten the better of these complaints.\" He recovered from this attack; but in the following year the disorder returned with redoubled violence, and brought on a consumption which terminated his existence on the 20th day of September 1639. He left behind him a son who was named after him, and one daughter.\n\nSo mild were the dispositions of Meurifus, that in all his writings he constantly avoided literary disputes. He was sometimes unavoidably drawn into them; but constantly endeavoured to promote a reconciliation rather than widen any breach, by his replies to the attacks of his adversaries. In his friendships he was firm and affectionate. Of his domestic life, whatever is known has been gathered from his letters. The same easy tranquillity seems to have attended him in every situation. In his family he was particularly fortunate. In his son, to whom he gave his own name, he seemed to behold his own youth renewed. The same application, the same eagerness in the pursuit of knowledge, marked the conduct of this promising young man; who did not long survive his father, but died soon after he had recommended himself to the notice of the learned world by his publications. They were only three in number; but displayed so much solid learning, that they have been assigned to the father, John Meurifus, by l'Abb\u00e9 Beughem and others. This mistake was occasioned as much by the multiplicity of their names, as by the nature of their works, and their manner of treating philological subjects.\n\nHis works may be divided into four classes, of which each might form a separate volume if they were ever to be republished. Meurifus himself indeed, in one of his letters to Voelius, proposes such a division. From that epistle, and from another which the younger Meurifus sent to G. J. Voelius, who strongly advised him to republish the whole of his father's writings, and from the collections of his posthumous works which have appeared from Struvinus, Grochupius, Moller, and some others, a catalogue of his works might be formed. Some assistance will also be derived from the indexes published in their respective works, by Hankins, Desfelius, Wettenuis, and Bartholomius. The plan which Meurifus recommends for publishing his works, is to insert in the first volume all that he has written relative to Athens; in the second, his historical pieces; in the third, his miscellaneous dissertations; and in the fourth, the various authors which he published, with his notes and corrections.\n\nA scandalous and indecent work, which is entitled \"Meurifus elegantiae Latini sermonis,\" and has \"Aloisia Sigae Satyrae Sotadicae\" annexed to it, is very falsely attributed to Meurifus; nor indeed are the Satires with more reason assigned to Aloisia Sigae, who was a Spanish lady eminent for her piety and virtue. The real author of these infamous productions was Westrenius, an advocate at Copenhagen, who probably assumed the name of Meurifus, in order to shield himself from the disgrace which would naturally have attended the writer of such a performance.","sp":352,"ep":353},{"h":"MEVANIA","t":"in Ancient Geography, a town of the Cispennine Umbria; seated at the confluence of the Tina and Clitumnus, on the Via Flaminia, famous for its herds of white cattle brought up there for sacrifice; the white colour said to be owing to the waters of the Clitumnus (Virgil).

They were expelled, as we are told, from their own country (supposed by Clavigero to have been Tollan, to the northward of Mexico) in the year 472; and for some time led a wandering life. In whatever place they determined to reside for any considerable time, they erected houses and cultivated the ground. Thus their migrations were extremely slow, and it was not till 104 years after they set out that they reached a place about 50 miles to the eastward of the city of Mexico, where they settled for 20 years, giving to their new place of residence the name of Tollanzinco. From thence they proceeded about 40 miles farther to the west, where they built a city called, from the name of their country, Tollan, or Tula.\n\nAfter the final settlement of the Toltecan, the government was changed into a monarchy. Their first king began his reign in 667, and their monarchy lasted 384 years, during which time they reckon just eight princes. We are not, however, to imagine that each of their kings lived long enough to make up this space. It was a custom among them that the name of the king should be continued for 52 years, and no longer, from the time he ascended the throne. If he died within that period, the government was carried on in his name by a regency; if he survived, he was obliged to resign his authority. During the four centuries that the Toltec monarchy continued, they had increased very considerably in number, and had built many cities; but when in the height of prosperity, almost the whole nation was destroyed by a famine occasioned by drought; and a pestilence, probably the consequence of the former. According to Torquemada (says our author), at a certain festival-ball made by the Toltecan, the sad-looking devil appeared to them of a gigantic size, with immense arms, and in the midst of the entertainment he embraced and suffocated them; that then he appeared in the form of a child with a putrid head,\nMexico and brought the plague; and, finally, at the persuasion of the same devil, they abandoned the country of Tula.\"\n\nThey were succeeded by the Chichemecas, a much more barbarous people, who came from an unknown country called Amaquemecan, where they had for a long time resided; but of which no traces of remembrance can be found among any of the American nations known to Europeans; so that Clavigero supposes it must have been very far to the northward.\n\nThe motive which the Chichemecas had for leaving their own country is not known. They were eighteen months on their journey, and took possession of the defoliate country of the Toltecas about a hundred years after the former had left it. They were much more uncivilized than the Toltecs; but, however, had a regular form of monarchical government, and in other respects were less disgusting in their manners than some of the neighbouring nations. The last king who reigned in Amaquemecan before the departure of the Chichemecas, had left his dominions between his two sons Auchcauhli and Xolotl, and the latter conducted the new colony. Having proceeded from the ruins of Tula towards Chempolla and Tepepolio, Xolotl sent his son to survey the country. The prince crossed the borders of the lakes and the mountains which surround the vale of Mexico; then ascending to the top of a very high one, he viewed the whole country, and took possession of it in the name of his father, by shooting four arrows to the four winds.\n\nXolotl being informed by his son of the nature of the country, chose for the capital of his kingdom Tenayuca, about six miles to the northward of the city of Mexico, and distributed his people in the neighbouring territory; but as most of them went to the northward, that part obtained the name of the country of the Chichemecas, in distinction from the rest. Here a review of the people was taken, and their number, according to Torquemada, was more than a million.\n\nXolotl finding himself peacefully settled in his new dominion, sent one of his officers to explore the sources of some of the rivers of the country. While performing this task he came to the habitations of some Toltecans, who it seems had still kept together, and were likely once more to become a nation. As these people were not inclined to war, and greatly esteemed for their knowledge and skill in the arts, the Chichemecas entered into a strict alliance with them, and Prince Nopaltzin, who had first surveyed the country, married a Toltec princess. The consequence of this alliance was the introduction of the arts and knowledge of the Toltecans among the Chichemecas. Till now the latter had subsisted entirely by hunting, and such fruits and roots as the earth spontaneously produced. They were clad in the skins of wild beasts, and, like these beasts, they are said to have sucked the blood of the animals they caught; but after their connection with the Toltecans they began to sow corn, to learn the art of digging and working metals, to cut stones, manufacture cotton, and, in every respect, to make great improvements.\n\nWhen Xolotl had reigned about eight years in his new territories, an embassy of six persons arrived from a distant country not far from Amaquemecan, expressing a desire of coming with their people to reside in the Mexico country of the Chichemecas. The king gave them a gracious reception, and assigned them a district; and, in a few years after, three other princes, with a great army of Acolhuans, who were likewise neighbours of Amaquemecan, made their appearance. The king was at that time at Tezcuco, to which place he had removed his court; and here he was accosted by the princes, who, in a submissive and flattering manner, requested him to allow them a place in his happy country, where the people enjoyed such an excellent government. Xolotl not only gave them a favourable reception, but offered them his two daughters in marriage, expressing his concern that he had no more, that none might have been excluded from the royal alliance. On the third prince, however, he bestowed a noble virgin of Chalco, in whom the Toltec and Chichemecan blood were united. The nuptials were celebrated with extraordinary pomp; and the two nations, after the example of the sovereigns, continued to intermarry. As the Acolhuans were the more civilized nation of the two, the name of Chichemecas began to be appropriated to the more rude and barbarous part, who preferred hunting to agriculture, or chose a life of savage liberty in the mountains to the restraints of social laws. These barbarians associated with the Otomies, another savage nation who lived to the northward, occupying a tract of more than three hundred miles in extent; and by their descendants the Spaniards were harassed for many years after the conquest of Mexico.\n\nAs soon as the nuptial rejoicings were over, Xolotl divided his territories into three parts, assigning one the domain of each of the princes. Acolhuatzin, who had married his eldest daughter, had Azocopazcalo, 18 miles Xolotl to the westward of Tezcuco; Chiconquauhtli, who married the other, had a territory named Xaltocan; and Tzontecomatl, who married the lady of inferior rank, had one named Coatlichan. The country continued for some time to flourish, population increased greatly, and with it the civilization of the people; but as these advanced, the vices of luxury and ambition increased in proportion. Xolotl found himself obliged to treat his subjects with more severity than formerly, and even to put some of them to death.\u2014This produced a conspiracy against him, which, however, he had the good fortune to escape; but while he meditated a severe revenge on the conspirators, he was seized with the distemper of which he died, in the fortieth year of his reign, and in a very advanced age.\n\nXolotl was succeeded by his son Nopaltzin, who at the time of his accession is supposed to have been the second about sixty years of age. In his time, the tranquillity of the kingdom, which had begun to suffer disturbance under his father, underwent much more violent shocks, and civil wars took place. Acolhuatzin, the only one of the three princes who remained alive, thinking the territory he possessed too narrow, made war upon the lord of a neighbouring province named Tapotzotlan, and deprived him of his territory. Huetzin, son to the late Prince Tzontecomatl, lord of Coatlichan, fell in love with the grand-daughter of the queen, a celebrated beauty, but was rivalled by a neighbouring lord, who determined to support his pretensions.\npretensions by force of arms. Huetzin, however, got the better, defeated and killed his adversary, and then possessed himself of the lady and his estate. This was followed by a rebellion of the whole province of Tolantzinco, so that the king himself was obliged to take the field. As the rebels were very numerous, the royal army was at first defeated; but having at last received a strong reinforcement, the rebels were overcome, and their ringleaders severely punished. The king did not long survive the restoration of tranquillity to his dominions. He died in the thirty-second year of his reign, and ninety-second of his age, leaving the throne to his eldest son Tlozotzin, who was an excellent prince, and reigned thirty-six years.\n\nQuinatzin, the son and successor of Tlozotzin, proved a vain and luxurious prince. His accession to the throne was celebrated with much greater pomp than any of his predecessors. Xolotl had removed his court from Tenayuca to Tezcoco; but being disgusted with this last place, on account of the conspiracy formed against him there, he had returned to Tenayuca.\u2014There the court continued till the reign of Quinatzin, who removed it back to Tezcoco.\n\nThe reign of Quinatzin, though tranquil at first, was soon disturbed by dangerous revolts and rebellions. These first broke out in two states, named Maztiztlan and Totopetl, situated among the northern mountains. The king, having collected a great army, marched without delay against the rebels, and challenged their leaders to come down and fight him in the plain.\u2014This challenge being accepted, a furious engagement ensued, in which, though great numbers fell on both sides, no decisive advantage was gained by either party. Frequent engagements took place for the space of forty days, until at last the rebels, perceiving that their own numbers were daily diminishing, without any possibility of being recruited like the royal army, made a final surrender to the king, who punished the ringleaders with great severity. Tranquillity, however, was not yet restored; the rebellion spread to such a degree, that the king was obliged not only to take the field in person, but to employ six other armies, under the command of faithful and experienced generals, to reduce the rebels. Those proved so successful in their enterprises, that in a short time the rebellious cities were reduced to obedience, and the kingdom enjoyed the blessings of peace during the long reign of Quinatzin, who is said to have sat on the throne for no less than sixty years. He was succeeded by his son Techotlatla; but as the affairs of the Acolhuans now began to be connected with those of the Mexicans, it will be proper to give some account of that people.\n\nThe Mexicans, called also the Aztecas, dwelt till the year 1160 in a country called Aztlan, situated to the north of the gulf of California, as appears by the route they pursued in their journey; but how far to the northward we are not certainly informed. Betancourt makes it no less than 2700 miles, and Boturini says it was a province of Asia. The cause of their migration is said to have been as follows:\n\nAmong the Aztecas was a person of great authority, named Huiztilin, to whose opinion every one paid the utmost deference. He had conceived a design to persuade his countrymen to change their residence; and to effect this he fell upon the following stratagem. Having heard, while meditating on his scheme, a little bird fingering on the branches of a tree, the notes of which resembled the word Tilhui, which in the Azteca language signified \"let us go,\" he took that opportunity to work upon the superstition of the people. With this view, he took along with him a respectable person, and made him attend to the note of the bird. \"What can it mean (says he), but that we must leave this country, and find ourselves another? Without doubt it is the warning of some secret divinity who watches over our welfare: let us obey, therefore, his voice, and not draw his anger upon us by a refusal.\" Tecpaltzin, for that was the name of his friend, readily agreed to the interpretation; and both of them being persons of great influence, their united persuasions soon gained over to their project the bulk of the nation, and they accordingly set out.\n\nThe Aztecas, when they left their original habitations, were divided into six tribes; but at Culiacan the tribes, the Xochimilcas, Tepanecas, Chalceles, Tlahuicas, and en image Tlacelalans. The cause of this separation is not known, but it was probably occasioned by some disagreement among themselves; for the remaining tribe was divided into two violent factions, which persecuted one another: neither did they afterwards construct any more edifices. However, they always travelled together, in order to enjoy the company of their imaginary god. At every place where they stopped an altar was erected to him; and at their departure they left behind them all their flocks, and probably also some others to take care of them, or such as were not willing to endure the fatigue of farther journeys. They flopped in Tula nine years, and eleven more in the neighbouring parts. At last, in 1216, they arrived at Zumpango, a considerable city in the vale of Mexico, where they were received in a very hospitable manner by the lord of that district. He not only assigned them proper habitations, but became very much attached to them; and even demanded from among them a wife for his son Ilhuicatl. This request was complied with; and from this marriage all the Mexican kings descended.\n\nThe Mexicans continued to migrate from one place to another along the lake of Tezcoco. Xolotl, who was then on the throne of the Acolhuans or Chichimecas, allowed them to settle in whatever places of his dominions they thought proper; but some of them finding themselves harassed by a neighbouring lord, the Mexicans were obliged, in 1245, to retire to Chapalotepec, a mountain on the western borders of the lake, scarcely cutted, two miles distant from the site of Mexico. This took place in the reign of Nopaltzin, when disturbances began to take place in the Acolhuans' dominions. The Mexicans, however, did not find themselves any more secure in their new place of residence than formerly; they were persecuted by the neighbouring lords, and obliged to take refuge in a number of small islands, named Acoocoleo, at the southern extremity of the lake of Mexico. Here for 52 years they lived in the most miserable manner, subsisting on fish, insects, roots, &c., and clothing themselves with the leaves of the amoxtli, which abounds in that lake.\n\nIn this miserable plight the Mexicans continued till the year 1314, when they were reduced to a state of slavery.\nthe most absolute slavery. This was done by the king of a petty state named Colhuacan, who, it is said, being unwilling to allow the Mexicans to maintain themselves in his territories without paying tribute, made war upon them, subdued and enslaved them. Others affirm that, pretending compassion for their miserable situation, he offered them a more commodious place of residence; The Mexicans readily accepted the offer; but had scarcely set out to take possession of their new place of residence when they were attacked by the Colhuans, made prisoners, and carried off for slaves.\n\nAfter some years a war broke out between the Colhuans and Xochimilcas, in which the latter gained such advantages, that they were obliged to employ their slaves to assist them. They accordingly ordered them to prepare for war, but without furnishing them with arms necessary for a military enterprise; so that the Mexicans were obliged to content themselves with long spears, having their points hardened in the fire; they also made knives of the stone itztil, and shields of reeds woven together. They agreed not to waste their time in making prisoners, but to content themselves with cutting off one ear of their enemies, and then leaving them without farther injury. They adhered punctually to this resolution; and rushing furiously upon the Xochimilcas, cut off an ear from as many as they could, killing those who struggled to such a degree that they could not effect their purpose. In short, so well did the Mexicans acquit themselves in this engagement, that the Xochimilcas fled, and took refuge among the mountains. After the battle, the Colhuan soldiers presented themselves before their general with the prisoners they had taken, by the number of which alone they judged of their valour. The Mexicans had taken only four, and these they kept concealed for the abominable purpose of sacrificing them. The Colhuans, therefore, seeing no trophies of their valour, began to reproach them with cowardice; but the Mexicans, producing their baskets of ears, defied them to judge from these how many prisoners they might have taken, had they not been unwilling to retard their victory by taking up time in binding them.\n\nNotwithstanding the valour displayed by the Mexicans in this engagement, it doth not appear that their haughty masters were in the least inclined to afford them easier terms than before. Having erected an altar to their god, they demanded of their lord something precious to offer in sacrifice to him; but he in disdain sent them a dirty cloth, enclosing the filthy carcass of a vile bird. This was carried by Colhuan priests; and without any ceremony laid upon the altar. The Mexicans, with apparent unconcern, removed this filthy offering, and put in its place a knife made of itztil, and an odoriferous herb. On the day of consecration, the Colhuan prince attended with his nobility; not with a view to do honour to the festival, but to make a mockery of the Mexicans. Their derision, however, was soon changed into horror, when the Mexicans, after a solemn dance, brought forth the four Xochimilcan prisoners they had taken; and, after having made them dance a little, cut open their breasts with the knife which lay on the altar, and plucking out their hearts, offered them, while yet palpitating with life, to their diabolical idol. This had such an effect upon the spectators, that both king and subjects desired the Mexicans immediately to quit their territories and go where they pleased. This order was instantly obeyed; the whole nation took their route towards the north, until they came to a place named Acatezintlan, situated between two lakes, and afterwards named Mexicozinteco; but for some reason or other, being discontented with this situation, as indeed they seem very often to have been, they proceeded to Ixtacalco, still nearer to the site of Mexico. Here they formed the image of a little mountain of paper, and danced round it a whole night, singing their victory over the Xochimilcas, and returning thanks to their god for having freed them from the yoke of the Colhuans. Clavigero is of opinion, that by this mountain they represented Colhuacan, as in their pictures it was always represented by a hunch-backed mountain; and this is the literal signification of the name.\n\nThe city of Mexico was founded in the year 1325. The city of Mexico in the most commodious situation we can imagine, viz., on a small island named Tenochtitlan, in the middle of a great lake, without ground to cultivate for their subsistence, or even room sufficient to build their habitations. Their life was therefore as miserable here for some time as it had been when they were on the islands at the end of the lake, and they were reduced to the same shifts to maintain themselves. To enlarge the boundaries of their island, they drove palisades into those parts of the water which were most shallow, terracing them with stones and turf, and uniting to their principal island several other smaller ones which lay in the neighbourhood. To procure to themselves afterwards stones, wood, &c., for constructing their habitations, as well as clothing and other necessaries, they instituted a commerce with the people who dwelt on the borders of the lake, supplying them with fish, waterfowl, and other more minute inhabitants of the lake and marshes, which they contrived to render eatable; and in return for all this they received the necessaries above mentioned. The greatest effort of their industry, however, was the construction of floating gardens, by means of bushes and the mud of the lake; and these they brought to such perfection that they produced maize, pepper, chia, French beans, and gourds.\n\nFor thirteen years that the Mexicans had struggled with extreme difficulty, they remained at peace; but factions soon after did they begin to prosper and live comfortably, than the inveterate enmity between the two factions broke out in all its fury. This produced a separation; and one of the parties took up their residence on a small island at a little distance to the northward, which, from a heap of sand found there, they at first named Xaltelolco, but afterwards Tlatelolco, from a terrace constructed by themselves. This island was afterwards united to that of Tenochtitlan.\n\nAbout this time the Mexicans divided their city into four parts, a division which still subsists; each quarter having now its tutelar saint, as it had formerly its tutelar god. In the midst of their city was the sanctuary of their great god Mexiltli, whom they constantly preferred to all the rest. To him they daily performed acts of adoration; but instead of making any progress in humanity, they seem to have daily improved in the most horrible barbarities, at least in their religion. The dreadful sacrifices made of their prisoners, could only be exceeded by that which we are now about to relate.\nBeing now on a more respectable footing than formerly, they sent an embassy to the petty king of Colhuacan, requesting him to send them one of his daughters, that she might be consecrated the mother of their protecting god. The unsuspecting prince readily complied with their desire. The unfortunate princess was conducted in great triumph to Mexico; but no sooner was she arrived, than she was sacrificed in a shocking manner; and, to add to the horror of the deed, the body was flayed, and one of the bravest young men of the nation draped in her skin. Her father, ignorant of this dreadful transaction, was invited by the Mexicans to be present at the apotheosis of his daughter, and went to see the solemnity, and to worship the new divinity. He was led into the sanctuary, where the young man stood clothed in the bloody skin of his daughter; but the darkness of the place prevented him from seeing what was before him. They gave him a censer in his hand, and some copal to begin his worship; but having discovered by the flame of the copal the horrible spectacle, he ran out in a distracted manner, calling upon his people to revenge the injury; but this they were not able to do at that time nor ever after.\n\nIn the year 1352 the Mexican government was changed from an aristocracy to a monarchy. At first they were governed by 20 lords, of whom one had an authority superior to the rest. This naturally suggested the idea of monarchy; and to this change they were also induced by the contemptible state in which their nation still continued, thinking that the royal dignity would confer upon it a degree of splendour which otherwise it could not enjoy; and that by having one leader, they would be better able to oppose their enemies. Proceeding, therefore, to elect a king, the choice fell upon Acamapitzin, a man of great estimation among them, and descended from Opophtli, a noble Aztec, and a princess of the royal family of Colhuacan. As he was yet a bachelor, they attempted to negotiate a marriage, first with the daughter of the lord of Tacuba, and then of the king of Azcapozalco; but these proposals being rejected with disdain, they applied to Acolmiztli lord of Coatlichan, and a descendant of one of the three Acolhuan princes; who complied with their request, and the nuptials were celebrated with great rejoicings.\n\nIn the mean time, the Tlatelolcos, the natural rivals of the Mexicans, resolved not to be behind them in anything which had the least appearance of augmenting the glory of their state. They likewise, therefore, chose a king; but not thinking proper to choose him from among themselves, they applied to the king of the Tepanecas, who readily sent them his son; and he was crowned first king of Tlatelolco in 1353. In this the Tlatelolcos seem to have had a design of humbling their rivals, as well as rendering themselves more respectable; and therefore it is probable, that they had represented the Mexicans as wanting in that respect due to the Tepanecan monarch, as having elected a king without his leave, though at the same time they were tributaries to him. The consequence of this was, that he took a resolution to double their tribute. Hitherto they had paid only a certain number of fish and waterfowl; but now they were ordered to bring also several thousands of fir and willow plants to be set in the roads and gardens of Azcapozalco, and to transport to the court a great floating garden, which produced vegetables of every kind known in Anahuac. This being accomplished with great difficulty, the king commanded them next year to bring him another garden, with a duck and swan in it both sitting upon eggs; but lo, that on their arrival at Azcapozalco the brood might be ready to hatch. This was also done; and the prince had the satisfaction of seeing the young birds come out of the eggs. The third year they were ordered to bring a live stag along with a garden. This was more difficult than any of the former tasks; because they were obliged, in order to hunt the stag, to go to the mountains of the continent, where they were in danger of falling into the hands of their enemies; however, this also was accomplished, and the desire of the king gratified.\n\nIn this manner the Mexicans were oppressed for no less than 30 years. They freed themselves, however, from all their difficulties by vigorous exertions, absurdly ascribing to the protection of that malevolent being whom they worshipped the glory of every deliverance. Acamapitzin governed this city, which at that time comprehended the whole of his dominions, for 37 years in peace. His queen being barren, he married another wife, but without abandoning the first; and these two, instead of being rivals to one another, lived together in the utmost harmony; the first wife taking upon herself the charge of educating Huitzilhuitl, the son of the second. He had, besides, several children by other women, and one named Izcoatl, who afterwards proved one of the best and most renowned kings who sat on the throne of Mexico. He is said also to have conquered four considerable cities; but Clavigero thinks he must in this only have been an auxiliary, it being very improbable, that while he could scarce maintain his own territories, he should think of foreign conquests.\n\nAcamapitzin died in 1389, greatly lamented by the Mexicans, and his death was followed by an interregnum of four months. As the deceased monarch had formally resigned his authority into the hands of his nobles, it was necessary that a new election should take place; and when this was done, the choice fell upon Huitzilhuitl, the son of Acama-Huitzilhuitl. As he was still unmarried, it was resolved, if possible, to procure him an honourable and advantageous match. With this view, a deputation of nobility was sent to the king of Azcapozalco, requesting, in very humble terms, an alliance with one of his daughters. The expressions made use of by these ambassadors are said by our author to have been particularly elegant in the Mexican language; but it is difficult to understand how a speech made among a people ignorant of the art of writing could be particularly recorded at the interval of some hundreds of years after. They are as follow: \"We beseech you, with the most profound respect, to take compassion on our matter and your servant Huitzilhuitl, confined among the thick rushes of the lake.\u2014He is without a wife, and we without a queen.\u2014Vouchsafe, Sir, to part with one of your jewels or most precious feathers. Give us one of your daughters, who may come to reign over us in a country which belongs to you.\"\nThis piece of oratory had such an effect upon the king, that he granted their request, and a Tepanecan princess was conducted in great triumph to Mexico, where the marriage was solemnized with the utmost the king of joy. Though this princess brought him a son for the first year of their marriage, the king, in order to strengthen himself by fresh alliances, married also the daughter of another prince, by whom he had Montezuma Ilhuicamina, the most celebrated of all the Mexican kings.\n\nAs the Mexicans advanced in wealth and power, so did their rivals the inhabitants of Tlatelolco. Their first king died in 1399, leaving his subjects greatly improved in civilization, and the city much enlarged and beautified. The rivalry which subsisted between the two cities had indeed greatly contributed to the aggrandizement of both. The Mexicans had formed too many alliances by marriage with the neighboring nations, had so much improved their agriculture and floating gardens on the lake, and had built so many more vessels to supply their extended commerce and fishing, that they were enabled to celebrate their secular year, answering to A.D. 1407, with greater magnificence than they had ever done since they left their original country of Atzlan.\n\nAll this time Teochitlala, the son of Quinatzin, continued to reign in Acollhuaucan, and for 50 years enjoyed uninterrupted tranquility; but being now very far advanced in years, and finding his end approach, he called to him his son Ixtlilxochitl, and recommended to him to beware of the ambitious disposition of the king of Azcapozalco, as he was apprehensive that he might attempt something against the peace of the empire. His suspicions were verified; for on the death of Teochitlala, which happened in 1406, the king of Azcapozalco, without making the usual submissions to the new king, to whom he was a feudatory, set out for his own territories, with a view to stir up the other feudatory princes to rebellion. Having called to him the kings of Mexico and Tlatelolco, he told them that Teochitlala, who had long tyrannized over that country, being dead, he designed to procure freedom to the princes, so that each might rule his own territory entirely independent of the king of Acollhuaucan; but for this purpose he needed their alliance, and trusted to their well-known spirit to take part with him in the enterprise. He informed them likewise, that in order to ensure success, he would find means to unite other princes in the confederacy.\n\nThe new king of Acollhuaucan, in the mean time, was employed in settling the affairs of his kingdom, and endeavouring to gain the good will of his subjects. The combination against him was soon discovered; but though Ixtlilxochitl was desirous of heading his army in person, he was dissuaded from doing so by his courtiers; so that the conduct of the war was committed to his generals. To weaken the enemy, they ravaged the territories of six revolted states; but notwithstanding this, and the superior discipline of the royal army, the war was carried on by the rebels with great obstinacy, their armies being constantly recruited by fresh troops in proportion to their losses. At last, after three years of a ruinous war, the king of Azcapozalco, finding that his resources would at last fail him, sued for peace; but with a design of accomplishing by treachery what he had not yet been able to do by force. His adversary, equally reduced with himself, consented to a peace, though he knew very well that the Tepanecan prince intended to observe it no longer than suited his purpose.\n\nIn the year 1409 died Huitzilhuitl king of Mexico-Chimalpopoca, who likewise left the right of electing a successor poca third to the nobility. They made choice of his brother king of Chimalpopoca; and from thence it became an established law to choose one of the brothers of the deceased king, or, if he had no brothers, to elect one of his grandsons. While the new prince was endeavouring to secure himself on the throne, the treacherous Tezozomoc used all means in his power to strengthen the party he had formed against the king of Acollhuaucan. In this he was attended with such success, that the unfortunate prince found himself reduced to the necessity of wandering among the neighboring mountains, at the head of a small army, accompanied by the lords of Huexotla and Coatlichan, who remained always faithful to him. The Tepanecans disturbed him to such a degree, by intercepting his provisions, that he was forced to beg them of his enemies. One of his grandsons was sent to Otompan, a rebel state, to death and request them to supply their king with the provisions he the king of flood in need of, and to exhort them to abandon the Acollhuaucan cause of the rebels, which they had espoused. No can talk could be more dangerous; yet such was the magnanimity of the young prince's disposition, that he readily set out on the journey; nor was he deterred by the information he got that there were in the place certain Tepanecans who had come on purpose to publish a proclamation from Tezozomoc. He went boldly to the most public place of the town, and in presence of those who published the proclamation made known his request. This heroism, however, did not meet with the success it deserved. His propositions were derided from the moment they were made; but the people did not offer any farther insult, until one of the manner fort threw a stone at him, exciting others of the same stamp to put him to death. The Tepanecans, who had hitherto continued silent, perceiving their opportunity, joined in the general cry to kill the prince, and began also to throw stones. The prince attempted first to defend himself, and afterwards to escape by flight; but, both being equally impossible, he fell under a shower of stones. The Tepanecans exulted in this act of treachery, and soon after cut off Ixtlilxochitl himself, after having treacherously persuaded him to a conference with two of their captains. This perfidious act was committed in sight of the royal army, who were too weak to revenge it; the royal corpse was saved with difficulty; and Nezahualcoyotl, heir apparent to the crown, was obliged to shelter himself among the bushes from the fury of his enemies.\n\nTezozomoc having now in a great measure gained his point, proceeded to pour down his troops upon the cities and districts which had remained faithful quired by the late unfortunate monarch. The people made a most desperate defense, and killed vast numbers of their enemies; but at last being themselves reduced by the calamities of war, and in danger of total extermination, they were obliged to quit their habitations and fly to other countries. The tyrant, then, finding himself\nself superior to all his adversaries, gave Tezcuco in fief to Chimalpopoca king of Mexico, Huexotla to Tlacacolotl of Tlatelolco; placing faithful governors in other places, and appointing Azcapozalco, the capital of his own territory, the royal residence and capital of Acolhuacan.\n\nPrince Nezahualcoyotl was present in disguise at this disposal of his dominions, along with several other persons of distinction who were enemies of the tyrant; and so much was he transported with passion, that it was with difficulty he could be restrained from killing Tezozomoc on the spot, though this would certainly have been done at the expense of his own life. All the rest of the Acolhuacan empire submitted; and Nezahualcoyotl saw himself for the present deprived of all hopes of obtaining the crown.\n\nTezozomoc had now attained the summit of his ambition; but instead of conciliating the minds of his new subjects, oppressed them with new taxes; and being conscious of the precarious situation in which he stood, and tormented with remorse on account of his crimes, fell into melancholy, and was constantly haunted with frightful dreams. He was now become so old, that his body no longer retained its natural heat. He was therefore obliged to be covered up with cotton in a great cradle, not being able to fit erect in a chair. In this miserable condition, however, he never forgot his tyranny or cruelty. From his cradle he issued oppressive laws relating to the Acolhuacans; and almost with his last breath renewed his commands with regard to Nezahualcoyotl. At last he expired in the year 1422, leaving the crown to his son Tajatzin.\n\nTezozomoc was no sooner dead than Maxtlaton, without paying the least regard to his father's will, began to exercise the functions of a sovereign. Though it was the right of Tajatzin to invite to his father's funeral whom he pleased, Maxtlaton took that upon himself. Nezahualcoyotl, though not invited, came among the rest; but though Tezitzintli, brother to Maxtlaton, inflicted upon his being put to death, the latter opposed it, as it could not then be done privately, and he hoped to find another opportunity. No sooner were the funeral ceremonies over, however, than Maxtlaton behaved in such a manner to his brother Tajatzin, that the prince thought proper to retire to Chimalpopoca king of Mexico, to whom he had been particularly recommended by his father, in order to have his advice. This monarch, agreeable to the character of that age and people, advised him to invite his brother to an entertainment, and then murder him. Unluckily for them both, this discourse was overheard by a servant, who in expectation of a reward informed the tyrant of what he had heard; but instead of this, Maxtlaton, pretending to disbelieve his story, drove the informer from his presence with ignominy. Notwithstanding this pretence, the tyrant had not the least doubt of the truth of what was told him; and therefore determined to rid himself of his brother without delay. This he soon accomplished in the very same way that had been projected against himself. Tajatzin, along with the kings of Mexico, Tlatelolco, and some other feudatory princes, were invited by Maxtlaton to an entertainment. The king of Mexico prudently excused himself, but the unsuspecting Tajatzin fell into the snare. He came to the place of entertainment, and was instantly put to death. The company were greatly alarmed; but Maxtlaton, having explained to them his reasons for so doing, they not murdered, only excused him, but proclaimed him king; to which it is not to be doubted that their fears greatly contributed.\n\nThough the king of Mexico escaped a sudden death by his absence at this time, it was only to perish in a more slow and ignominious manner. The vengeance of the Maxtlaton first appeared by sending him a woman's king of drefs in return to the present he sent him as a feudatory; which being a reflection upon his courage, was the highest affront that could be offered him. This insult, however, was quickly followed by one of a much higher nature. Having heard that one of the Mexican prince's wives was an extraordinary beauty, he enjoined some Tepanecan ladies, who were accustomed to visit that princess, to invite her to spend some days with them at Azcapozalco. This being complied with, the tyrant easily got an opportunity of ravishing her, and then sent her back to her husband. Chimalpopoca was so much affected by this misfortune, that he resolved to offer himself up a sacrifice to his god. Maxtlaton, however, was resolved that he should not have even this satisfaction. At the very time of the ceremony, therefore, he sent a body of troops; who entering Mexico without resistance, carried off the king alive, to the astonishment of the multitude; and who probably were so much confounded by this unexpected adventure, that they did not think of making any resistance.\n\nChimalpopoca being carried prisoner to Azcapozalco, was confined in a strong wooden cage, the common prison for criminals. Maxtlaton still was not satisfied: he wished to get into his hands Nezahualcoyotl; and with this view sent a message to him, pretending that he was willing to come to an agreement with him respecting the kingdom of Acolhuacan. Though the prince was well assured of the tyrant's treacherous intentions, he went boldly to his palace, presented himself before him, and told him that he had heard of the imprisonment of the king of Mexico; he had heard also that he wished to take away his own life; he desired him to do so, and to gratify his malice. Maxtlaton was so struck with this speech, that he assured the prince he had not formed any design against his life, and that he neither had put to death the king of Mexico, nor would do so. He then gave orders for his being properly entertained, and even allowed him to pay a visit to the king of Mexico in prison. The unfortunate Chimalpopoca, after reciting his misfortunes, requested the prince not to return to court, where they would certainly fall upon some project for taking away his life; and having pathetically recommended to him the care of his subjects, made him a present of a gold pendant and some other jewels he wore; after which they took a last farewell.\n\nIn the mean time, the Mexicans raised to the throne Itzcoatl, the son of Acamapitzin by a slave, and who was accounted the most prudent, just, and brave, of all Mexico, the Mexican nation. His election was no less pleasing who affords to Nezahualcoyotl and his party, than it was offensive to Maxtlaton. An alliance was quickly concluded between...\nbetween the exiled prince and the king of Mexico; and this was soon followed by the commencement of hostilities on the part of the former. His first enterprise was against the city of Tezcuco, which he determined to take by assault, but was prevented by the submission of the inhabitants. He put to death, however, all the officers established by the tyrant; and all the Tepanecs he found there. The very same day another large city named Acolman was furiously attacked by a detachment of his army; great numbers put to the sword, and among the rest the governor, who was brother to Maxtlaton; and the same day also Coatlichan was taken by the Chalcefe.\n\nThe Mexican monarch, hearing of the successes of his ally, sent an embassy to congratulate him upon them. His ambassador was a son of king Huitzilihuatl, named Montezuma, who for his invincible courage and great qualities was furnamed the man of great heart and the archer of heaven. The journey was extremely dangerous; but Montezuma undertook it without any fear, accompanied by another nobleman. They got in safety to the place where the prince was; but had the misfortune to be taken prisoners, and were carried to Chalco; the lord of which city, named Tototzin, was an inveterate enemy to the Mexicans. By him he was immediately put in close confinement, under the care of one Quateozin, who was inviolably attached to the Mexican interest. Orders were given to the latter to provide no sustenance for the prisoners but what was preferable by his lord, until the mode of death which they were to suffer should be determined. Tototzin then sent his prisoners to them, that they might be sacrificed there if they thought proper. These people, however, rejected the proposal with disdain; on which Tototzin, thinking to regain the favour of Maxtlaton, informed him of the prisoners he had in his possession. But Maxtlaton called him a double minded traitor, and commanded him instantly to set the prisoners at liberty. Before this answer arrived, however, Quateozin had instructed the prisoners how to make their escape, and directed them also not to return by land lest they should again be intercepted, but to embark at a certain place, and proceed by water to Mexico. They followed his advice exactly; and having got to the place to which they were directed, arrived safely at their city, to the great surprise and joy of the inhabitants.\n\nTototzin, enraged at the loss of his prisoners, put Quateozin to a cruel death, destroying also all his family excepting one son and a daughter; of whom the latter fled to Mexico, where she was highly honoured on her father's account. Maxtlaton, too, notwithstanding his generosity to the prisoners (which Clavigero derives from mere opposition to Tototzin), prepared to wage a formidable war with the Mexicans, who had agreed to unite their troops with those of the prince. The Mexican populace, terrified at engaging so powerful an enemy, demanded that their king should submit and beg for peace. So great was the tumult, that the king himself was obliged to consent; and it required the utmost exertions of Montezuma's eloquence to persuade the people to agree to a commencement of hostilities. This being done at last, the king next called together the chief nobility, and asked which of them would have the courage to carry an embassy to the king of the Tepanecs? This adventure appeared so hazardous, that all of them kept a deep silence, until Montezuma declared himself willing to undertake the arduous enterprise. He was ordered to propose peace to Maxtlaton, but to accept of no dishonourable conditions; to which he punctually adhered. Maxtlaton refused to give any immediate answer, but promised to give one next day, after he had consulted his nobility. Montezuma, dreading some treachery if he stood all night, promised to return next day; which he did, and was told that Maxtlaton had determined upon war. Montezuma then performed the ceremony of challenging him, by presenting him with certain defensive weapons, anointing his head, and fixing feathers upon it, as was customary to do with dead persons. Lastly, He protested, in the name of his master, that as Maxtlaton would not accept of the offered peace, he and all the Tepanecs would infallibly be ruined. Maxtlaton showed not the least sign of displeasure, but gave Montezuma arms in like manner to present to the king of Mexico; and directed him, for his personal security, to return in disguise through a small outlet from the palace. Montezuma followed his advice; but as soon as he found himself out of danger, began to insult the Tepanean guards; and though they rushed violently upon him, he not only escaped from their attacks, but killed one or two of them.\n\nOn his return to Mexico, the populace were again thrown into the utmost consternation by the news that war was inevitable, as the chiefs of the two nations had challenged one another. They now requested the king to allow them to retire from their city, of which they supposed the ruin to be certain. The king encouraged them with the hopes of victory. \"But if we are conquered (replied they), what will become of us?\" \"If that happens (answered the king), we are that moment bound to deliver ourselves into your hands, to be made sacrifices at your pleasure.\" \"Be it so (replied they), if we are conquered; but if we obtain the victory, we and our descendants are bound to be tributary to you; to cultivate your lands and those of your nobles; to build your houses; and to carry for you, when you go to war, your arms and baggage.\"\n\nMatters being thus settled, intelligence was sent to Prince Nezahualcoyotl to repair with his army to Mexico, which he did without delay; and the day after his arrival a furious engagement took place. The Tepanecan army was commanded by a general named Mazon; Maxtlaton himself not judging it proper to quit his capital. The soldiers on both sides fought with the utmost bravery; but towards night the Mexicans, disheartened by seeing the army of their enemies continually increasing in number, began once more to lose their courage and talk of surrendering. The king, greatly concerned, asked Montezuma what should be done to dissipate the fears of the people? That brave prince replied, that they must fight till death; that if they died with their arms in their hands, it would be honourable; but to survive their defeat, would be eternal ignominy. Nothing could be more salutary than this advice at so critical a juncture: for the Mexicans were already begun to implore the mercy of their enemies, and to promise to sacrifice their chiefs, whose ambition had brought the whole nation into\nMexico into such a dilemma. On hearing this, the whole body of nobility, with the king and Montezuma at their head, assaulted the enemy so furiously, that they repelled them from a ditch of which they had taken possession; after which, Montezuma, happening to encounter Mazatl the Tepanecan general, struck him such a blow on the head that he fell down lifeless. Thus the Mexicans were inspired with fresh courage, and their enemies proportionally dispirited: however, they retired for that night to the city, in some hopes of being able to retrieve their fortune next day. Maxtlaton encouraged them by every method in his power; but fortune proved still more unfavourable than the day before. The Tepanecans were now entirely defeated, and the city of Azcapotzalco taken. Maxtlaton, who seems not to have had the courage to fight, had not now the presence of mind to fly. He attempted indeed to hide himself; but being quickly discovered, he was beaten to death with sticks and stones. The city was plundered, the inhabitants butchered, and the houses destroyed by the victors.\n\nThis victory proved decisive in favour of the confederates. Every other place of strength in the country was quickly reduced, until the Tepanecans, finding themselves on the verge of destruction, sent an humble embassy to the king of Mexico, requesting to be taken under his protection, and to become tributaries to him. Itzcoatl received them graciously; but threatened them with total extirpation if they violated the fidelity they had sworn to him.\n\nItzcoatl, after this extraordinary success, took care to have the above-mentioned contract ratified between the nobility and common people, by which the latter were bound to perpetual services. Those who had discouraged the soldiers in time of battle were banished for ever from the state of Mexico; while Montezuma and others who had distinguished themselves by their bravery, were rewarded with lands, as was usual with other conquerors.\n\nNezahualcoyotl made king of Acolhuacan.\n\nItzcoatl, now finding himself firmly seated on the throne of Mexico, set about performing his engagements to the Acolhuacan prince, by seating him on the throne of his ancestors. Having again joined their armies, they marched against Huaxotla, a city which refused to submit even though terms of pardon were offered them. Instead of this, they rashly ventured a battle, in which they were entirely defeated; and were then fain to send a deputation of their old men, pregnant women, &c., as was customary in cases of distress, to move the enemy to compassion. At last all obstructions being removed, Nezahualcoyotl was seated on the throne of Acolhuacan, the auxiliary troops were dismissed, and Itzcoatl left at liberty to pursue his conquests, in which he was still assisted by the king of Acolhuacan. The first expedition was against Cojohuacan, and other two Tepanecan cities, who had not only refused submission themselves, but excited others to shake off the yoke also. The war against them proved bloody. Three battles were fought, in which Itzcoatl gained no other advantage than making the enemy retreat a little; but in the fourth, while the two armies were hotly engaged, Montezuma, with a body of chosen troops, which he had placed in ambush, attacked the rear-guard of the rebels with such vigour, that they were soon disordered, and obliged to fly to the city. The conquerors pursued them thither; and Montezuma perceiving that they intended to fortify themselves in the greater temple, frustrated their design by getting possession of it and burning the turret. By this disaster they were so much terrified, that they fled to the mountains south of Cojohuacan; but even there the royal army overtook and pursued them more than 30 miles, till they came to another mountain, where, quite exhausted with fatigue, and seeing no means of escape, they were obliged to surrender at discretion.\n\nHaving thus happily accomplished the conquest of Cojohuacan and the other rebellious cities, the two kings returned to Mexico. Itzcoatl gave great part of the Tepanecan country, with the title of king of Tacuba, to Totogihuatzin, a grandson of Tezozomoc, but who does not appear to have been any way concerned in his projects against the Mexicans. An alliance was then formed among the three kings on the following terms: The king of Tacuba held his crown between on condition of serving the king of Mexico with all the kings his troops, at any time when required; for which he was to have a fifth part of the spoils taken from the enemy. The king of Acolhuacan was likewise to assist the king of Mexico in war; and for this he was to have a third part of the plunder, after deducting the share of the king of Tacuba; and the remainder was to belong to the king of Mexico. The kings of Tacuba and Acolhuacan were both declared honorary electors of the kings of Mexico; the real electors being four nobles: and the king of Mexico was likewise bound to assist in the wars of his allies whenever it was demanded.\n\nAfter having thus settled matters among themselves, and rewarded their soldiers, Itzcoatl set out with Nezahualcoyotl for Tezcuco, where the Acolhuacan king was crowned with all possible ceremony. Here the new king took every method which prudence could suggest to establish his authority on a permanent basis; but while he was thus employed, the Xochimilcas, fearing lest the Mexicans might conquer their country as they had done that of the Tepanecans, held a council on what was to be done to prevent such a disgrace. In this council it was determined to commence hostilities against that rising state, before it should become more formidable by new conquests. Itzcoatl was no sooner informed of this determination, than he sent Montezuma with a great army against them. The Xochimilcas met him with one still more numerous; but being worse disciplined, they were quickly defeated, and their city taken in a very short time after. This conquest was followed by the reduction of Cuilabuc\u00e9, situated on a small island in the lake of Chalco. Their insular situation gave them confidence to attack the formidable power of the Mexicans. The king was so sensible of the difficulty of this enterprise, that he proposed to attack them with the whole force of the alliance: Montezuma, however, with only a small number of men of his own training, whom he furnished with proper vessels, reduced them in seven days.\n\nItzcoatl died in the year 1436, at a very advanced age, in the height of prosperity, and was succeeded as king by Montezuma I., the greatest monarch that ever sat on the Mexican throne. Before his coronation, in order to comply with the barbarous rites of his religion,\nMexico, he made war upon the Chalcefe, in order to procure the prisoners who were to be sacrificed at his coronation; and scarce was this ceremony over, when a new war commenced, which terminated in the destruction of that city. This quarrel happened between the Chalcefe and the Tezcucans. Two of the royal princes of Tezcuco having gone a-hunting on the mountains which overlook the plains of Chalco, while employed in the chase, and separated from their retinue, with only three Mexican lords, fell in with a troop of Chalcefe soldiers; who, to gratify the cruelty of their master, carried them all prisoners to Chalco. The cruel and inconsiderate tyrant who commanded there instantly put them all to death; after which he caused their bodies to be salted, dried, and placed in an hall of his palace, where they served as torches to the pine torches burned there for lights every evening. The king of Tezcuco, overwhelmed with grief, and to the last degree exasperated at such an inhuman act, called for the alliance of the allied kings. The city was attacked at once by land and water. The inhabitants, knowing that they had no mercy to expect, fought like men in despair. Even the old tyrant who commanded them, though unable to walk, caused himself to be carried in a litter among the combatants; notwithstanding which they were totally defeated, and the most severe vengeance executed upon them.\n\nMontezuma, on his return, found himself obliged to encounter an enemy more formidable on account of his vicinity, than more powerful ones at a distance. This was the king of Tlatelolco, who had formerly conspired against the life of Itzcoatl; and finding himself disappointed in this, had tried to reduce his power by entering into a confederacy with some of the neighbouring lords. At that time his designs proved abortive, but he resumed them in the time of Montezuma; the consequence of which was, that he was defeated and killed. One Moquihuix was chosen in his room; in whose election it is probable that Montezuma had a considerable share. This was followed by conquests of a much more important nature. The province of Cuilixcas, lying to the southward, was added to his dominions, comprehending a tract of country more than 150 miles in breadth; then, turning to the westward, he conquered another named Tzompalhuacan. This success, however, was for a short time interrupted by a war with Atonaltzin, lord of a territory in the country of the Mixtecas. This prince, puffed up on account of the great wealth he possessed, took it into his head that he would allow no Mexican to travel through his country. Montezuma sent ambassadors to know the reason of such strange conduct; but Atonaltzin gave them no other answer than throwing them some part of his wealth, making a present to the king, and desiring him from thence to observe how much the subjects of Atonaltzin loved him; and that he willingly accepted of war, which was to determine whether he should pay tribute to the Mexicans or the Mexicans to him. Montezuma having informed his allies of this insolent answer, sent a considerable army against Atonaltzin, but had the mortification to be informed of its defeat; in consequence of which the pride of Atonaltzin was increased to a great degree. Montezuma, greatly chagrined at this first check, determined to head his next army in person; but before he could call together another, Atonaltzin had drawn into a confederacy with him the Huexotzingos and Tlalcalans, who were glad of the opportunity, as they supposed, of reducing the power of the Mexicans. Their numbers, however, availed but little; Montezuma in the very first engagement totally defeated the confederate army. The allies of Atonaltzin were particularly unfortunate; for such of them as were not killed in the field of battle, were destroyed by their own party out of revenge for the unfortunate event of the battle.\n\nBy this victory the Mexican monarch became master not only of the dominions of Atonaltzin, but of many other neighbouring princes, against whom he made war on account of their having put to death some Mexican merchants or couriers without any just cause. The conquest of Cuetlachitlan or Coctla, however, which he attempted in 1457, proved a much more difficult task. This province lies on the coast of the Mexican gulf, and had been formerly inhabited by the Olmecans, whom the Tlalcalans had driven out. The inhabitants were very numerous; but dreading the power of Montezuma, called in those of Tlalcal, together with the Huexotzingos, to their assistance. Along with these allies drew the Cholulans, also into the confederacy; so that this seems to have been the most formidable combination that had yet been formed against the Mexican power. Montezuma collected an excellently equipped army; which, however, he did not on this occasion command in person. It contained a great number of persons of very high rank, among whom were three princes of royal blood, and Moquihuix king of Tlatelolco already mentioned. The combination of the three republics against Mexico was not known at court when the army set out; but Montezuma, being informed of it soon after, sent an order to his generals to return. This accorded so ill with the romantic notions of valour entertained by the Mexicans, that a consultation of the generals was held whether they should obey it or not. At last it was determined that the king's order should be obeyed; but no sooner was this agreed to than Moquihuix accused them all of cowardice, and threatened, with his own troops, unfitted, to go and conquer the enemy. His speech had such an effect upon them all, that they went to meet the confederates. The Cotatltecs fought with great valour, but were unable to resist the royal forces; and their allies were almost totally destroyed. Six thousand two hundred of them were taken prisoners, and soon after sacrificed to the Mexican god of war in the barbarous manner already described. The victory was said to have been owing principally to the valour and good conduct of Moquihuix, inasmuch that to this day a long made in his praise on that occasion is known in Mexico. Montezuma was so well pleased with the victory, that he not only forgave the disobedience of his orders, but bestowed upon Moquihuix a princess, one of his own cousins, to wife.\n\nDuring the reign of this great monarch a violent inundation happened in Mexico. The lake, swelled and swollen by the excessive rains which fell in the year 1446, poured its waters into the city with so much violence that many\nMexico.\n\nmany houses were destroyed, and the streets inundated to such a degree that boats were everywhere made use of. The inundation was soon followed by a famine. This was occasioned by the stinting of the crop of maize in 1448; the ears while young and tender being destroyed by frosts. In 1450 the crop was totally lost for want of water; and in 1451, besides the unfavourable seasons, there was a scarcity of feed. Hence, in 1452, the necessities of the people became so great, that they were obliged to sell themselves for slaves in order to procure subsistence. Montezuma permitted them to go to other countries for support; but being informed that many sold themselves for a few days provision, he ordered, by proclamation, that no woman should sell herself for less than 400 ears of wheat, nor any man for less than 500. He opened also the public granaries for the relief of the lower classes; but nothing was able to stop the progress of the famine.\n\nMontezuma was succeeded by Axayacatl, who like his predecessor instantly commenced a war, for no other reason than that he might have prisoners to sacrifice at his coronation. He pursued Montezuma's plan of conquest; in which, however, he was less successful, many of the provinces reduced by that monarch having revolted after his death, so that it was necessary to reconquer them. On his returning successful from one of these expeditions, he built a new temple, to which he gave the name of Coateotl; but the Tlatelolcos, whose ancient rivalry seems to have revived on the death of Montezuma, built another in opposition, which they called Coaxotl. Thus the former hatred between the two nations was renewed, and a discord took place which ended in the ruin of the Tlatelolcos.\n\nThe Mexicans sustained an irreparable loss in 1469 and 1470 by the death of their allies the kings of Tacuba and Acolhuacan.\n\nThe king of Tacuba was succeeded by his son Chimalpopoca, and the Acolhuacan monarch by his son Nezahualpilli. A short time after the accession of the latter, the war broke out between the Tlatelolcos and Mexicans, which ended in the destruction of the former. King Moquihuix had been married by Montezuma to a sister of Axayacatl, now on the throne of Mexico; but it appears that this princess never was greatly the object of his affection. On the contrary, he took all methods of expressing his dislike, either out of enmity to herself, or envy of the superior greatness of her brother. Not content with this, he entered into an alliance with a great number of the neighbouring states, in order to reduce the Mexican greatness. His wife, however, being informed of this scheme, communicated the particulars to her brother; and soon after, being impatient of the ill usage she received, came to Mexico with her four sons to claim the protection of her brother. This uncommon accident exasperated the Mexicans and Tlatelolcos against each other to such a degree, that wherever they met, they fought, abused, and murdered each other. The king of Tlatelolco prepared for war with many horrible ceremonies, of which the drinking of human blood was one. A day was appointed for attacking Mexico. Xiloman, lord of Colhuacan, was to begin the attack, afterwards to pretend flight, in order to induce the Mexicans to follow him; after which the Tlatelolcos were to fall upon their rear.\n\nFor some reason, however, with which we are not acquainted, the Tlatelolcos began the attack without waiting for Xiloman; the consequence of which was, that he retired in disgust, leaving them to finish their battle the best way they could. The engagement lasted till night, when the Tlatelolcos were obliged to retire. Axayacatl, during the night, disposed of his troops in all the roads which led to Tlatelolco, appointing them to meet in the market-place. The Tlatelolcos, finding themselves attacked on all sides, retired gradually before the Mexicans, until at last they were forced into the market-place, where they found themselves worse than ever on account of its narrowness, which did not allow them room to act. The king stood on the top of the great temple, encouraging his men to exert themselves against the enemy. His words, however, had now lost their usual influence. He not only was not obeyed, but was reproached with cowardice because he did not come down and fight among the rest. At last the Mexicans arrived at the temple, and ascended to the balcony where the king was. He made a desperate defence for a little; but by a violent push in the breast was thrown backwards upon the steps of the temple, and flung or perhaps killed by the fall.\n\nThe Tlatelolcos being thus reduced, Axayacatl next set out on an expedition against the Matlazincas, a tribe in the vale of Toluca, who still refused to submit to the Mexican yoke. Having proved successful in this expedition, he undertook to subdue also the northern part of the valley, now called Valle de Ixtlahuacan, particularly Xiquipiloa, a considerable city and state of the Otomies, whose chief was much renowned for strength and bravery. Axayacatl, who likewise valued himself on these qualities, encountered him in single combat. In this, however, he was overmatched, and received a violent wound in the thigh; after which he would have been taken prisoner, had not some young Mexicans made a desperate effort for his rescue. Notwithstanding this disaster, Axayacatl's army gained a complete victory, carrying off 11,000 prisoners, among whom was the chief of the Otomies himself, and two of his officers who had attacked the king. These chiefs were put to death at an entertainment of the allied kings, the sight of their agonies not interrupting in the least the mirth of the feast; so much were they familiarized to the shedding of human blood.\n\nHe was succeeded by his elder brother Tizoc, succeeded. He intended to have built a larger temple than any that had yet been seen in Mexico, though that originally built had been greatly enlarged by some of his predecessors. For this purpose he collected a great quantity of materials; but before he could bring his projects to bear, he was taken off by a conspiracy of his subjects. During the reign of Tizoc, the Acolhuacans made war upon the Huezotzinca, ruined their city, and conquered their territory. Nezahualpilli also, the Acolhuacan monarch, though he had already several wives, had not made any of them queen, having wished to confer that honour upon one of the royal family of Mexico. Tizoc readily gave him one of his granddaughters, who had a sister of singular beauty named Xocoloxin. The friendship betwixt these two ladies was such, that the one could\nnot think of being separated from the other; for which reason the new queen sought and obtained permission to take her sister along with her to Tezcoco. Xocotzin had not been long there before the king fell in love with her, and married her with the title of queen likewise. Soon after this second marriage, the first queen brought forth a son named Cacamatzin, who succeeded him in the throne, and was afterwards taken prisoner by the Spaniards.\n\nAhuitztl, the brother of Tizoc, succeeded him in the kingdom of Mexico. His first object was to finish the great temple begun by his predecessor; and such was the number of workmen, that it was completed in four years. During the time that it was building, the king employed himself in making war with different nations, referring all the prisoners he took for victims at the dedication of the temple. The number of prisoners sacrificed at this dedication is said by Torquemada to have been 72,324; by other historians 64,060. The miserable victims were ranged in two files, each a mile and an half in length, terminating at the temple. The same year another temple was built by a feudatory lord, in imitation of the great one built by the king; at the dedication of which a vast number of prisoners were also sacrificed. These temples were dedicated in 1486. In 1487 happened a violent earthquake; and Chimalpopoca king of Acolhuacan died, who was succeeded by Totoquihuatzin II.\n\nAhuitzotl died in 1502, of a disorder produced by a contusion in his head. At the time of his death, the Mexican empire was brought to its utmost extent. His successor, Montezuma Xocoyotzin or Montezuma Junior, was a person of great bravery, besides which he was likewise a priest, and held in great estimation on account of his gravity and the dignity of his deportment. His election was unanimous; and the nobles congratulated themselves on the happiness the country was to enjoy under him, little thinking how short the duration of their happiness or of their empire was to be.\n\nThe first care of the new monarch, as usual, was to procure victims for the barbarous sacrifices to be made at his coronation. The people of Atlisco, who had again shaken off the Mexican yoke, were the sufferers on this occasion, being once more reduced, though not without great loss on the part of the Mexicans, some of whose bravest officers perished in the war. The ceremony of coronation was performed with such pomp as had never been seen before in Mexico; but no sooner was this ceremony over than Montezuma began to discover a pride which nobody had suspected before. All his predecessors had been accustomed to confer offices upon persons of merit, and those who appeared the most able to discharge them, without any partiality as to birth or wealth. Montezuma, however, disapproved of the conduct of his predecessors, under pretence that the plebeians should be employed according to their rank; for that in all their actions the baseness of their birth and the meanness of their education appeared; and in consequence of this maxim he deprived all the commoners of the offices they held about the court, declaring them incapable of holding any for the future. All the royal servants now were people of rank. Besides those who lived in the palace, 600 feudatory lords and nobles came to pay court to him. They passed the whole day in the antichamber, where none of their servants were permitted to enter; conversing in a low voice, and waiting the orders of their sovereign. The servants of these lords were so numerous that they occupied three small courts of the palace, and many waited in the streets.\n\nIn every respect Montezuma kept up, as far as was possible, an extravagant appearance of dignity. His clothes, kitchen utensils were of the finest earthen ware, and played in his tablecloths and napkins of the finest cotton; but none of these ever served the emperor more than once, being immediately made a present of to some nobleman. The vessels in which his chocolate and other drinks from cocoa were prepared, were all of gold, or some beautiful sea-shell, or naturally-formed vessels, curiously varnished. He had also gold plate, but it was used only on particular occasions in the temple. The number and variety of his dishes astonished the Spaniards. He took great delight in the cleanliness of his own person, and of everything about him. He bathed regularly every day, and had baths in all his palaces. Every day he wore four dresses, never using again those which he had put off, but reserving them as largesse for the nobility, or those who had distinguished themselves in war. The expense of all this rendered him very disagreeable to a great number of his subjects; though others were pleased with the readiness he showed to relieve the necessities of individuals, and his generosity in rewarding his generals and ministers who deserved it. Among other actions worthy of imitation, he appointed the city of Colhuacan as an hospital for all invalids, who after having faithfully served the crown either in the civil or military line, required a provision on account of their age and infirmities. In this place they were maintained and attended at the expense of the king.\n\nThe reign of Montezuma, even before the arrival of the Spaniards, was far from being so glorious with regard to his successes in war as those of his predecessors had been. He reduced indeed one rebellious province, and conquered another which had never before been subjugated; but in his war with Tlacalca he was with Tlacalca by no means successful. This was but a small republic at no great distance from the capital, but the inhabitants were remarkable for their bravery and independent spirit. The neighbouring states, however, who had been reduced by the Mexicans, envious of their liberty and prosperity, exasperated the Mexicans against them, by representing that the Tlacalcanes were delirious of making themselves masters of the maritime provinces on the Mexican gulf, and that by their commerce with these provinces they were increasing their wealth and power, and gaining the hearts of the people with whom they were to traffic. In consequence of this representation, strong garrisons were placed on the frontiers of Tlacalca, to obstruct the commerce of the inhabitants, and thus to deprive them of the means of obtaining some of the necessaries of life. The Tlacalcanes complained; but received no other answer than that the king of Mexico was lord of all the world, and that the Tlacalcanes must submit and pay tribute to him. The Tlacalcanes returned a spirited answer to this insolent speech, and began to fortify their frontier. They had already enclosed all the lands of the republic.\nblic with intrenchments; and to these they now added a wall of six miles in length on the west side, where an invasion was most to be apprehended; and so well did they defend themselves, that though they were frequently attacked by the neighbouring states in alliance with Mexico, or subject to it, not one of them was able to wrest a foot of ground from them. Thus a continual series of wars and engagements took place between the states of Mexico and this republic, which continued till the arrival of the Spaniards.\n\nDuring the remainder of Montezuma's reign the empire was disturbed by various rebellions, of which the accounts are not sufficiently interesting to merit a particular detail; but in the year 1580, Montezuma began to entertain apprehensions of that fatal event which at length overtook him. An expedition having been undertaken against a very distant region named Amatla, the army in marching over a lofty mountain were attacked by a furious north wind, accompanied with snow; which made great havoc in the army, many of them perishing with cold, and others being killed by the trees rooted up by the wind. The remains of the army continued their march to Amatla, where they were almost all killed in battle. By this and other calamities, together with the appearance of a comet, the Mexicans were thrown into the utmost consternation. Montezuma was so terrified by these omens, that having in vain consulted his astrologers, he applied to the king of Acolhuacan, who was reported to be very skilful in divination. Nezahualpilli having conferred with him upon the subject, told Montezuma that the comet presaged some calamity which was about to befall their kingdoms by the arrival of a new people; but this being unsatisfactory to the emperor, the king of Acolhuacan challenged him to a game at foot-ball, staking the truth of his prediction on the issue of the game. Montezuma lost the game, but did not yet acquiesce in the truth of his prediction. He therefore applied to a celebrated astrologer, whom it seems he had not yet consulted; but he confirmed the interpretation of Nezahualpilli: for which the emperor caused his house to be pulled down, and himself buried in the ruins.\n\nConquest of Mexico itself was first discovered, though imperfectly, by a Spaniard named Nunez de Balboa; but in 1518 the conquest of it was undertaken by a celebrated adventurer named Ferdinando Cortes. On the 13th of February 1519, he set sail from the Havannah in Cuba; and soon landed on the island of Cozumel, on the coast of Yucatan, discovered the preceding year. Here he joined one of his officers named Pedro d'Alvarado, who had arrived some days before, and collected some booty and taken a few prisoners. But the general severely censured his conduct; and the prisoners were dismissed, after they had been informed by an Indian interpreter named Melchior, that such injuries were entirely disagreeable to the intentions and wishes of Cortes. Here he mustered his army, and found that it amounted to 508 soldiers, 16 horsemen, and 109 mechanics, pilots, and mariners. Having encouraged his men by a proper speech, and released, by means of some Indian ambassadors, a Spaniard named Jeronimo de Aguilar, who had been detained a prisoner for eight years, he proceeded to the river Tabasco, where he hoped to be received in a friendly manner, as one Grijalva had been a short time before; but, from some unknown cause, he was violently attacked by them; however, the superiority of the Spanish arms soon decided the victory, and the inhabitants were obliged to own the king of Castile as their sovereign.\n\nThe Spaniards then continued their course westward, to the harbour of St Juan de Ulua; where they were met by two Mexican canoes, which carried two ambassadors from the emperor of that country, and showed the greatest signs of peace and amity. Their language was unknown to Aguilar; but one of the female prisoners above mentioned understood it, and translated it into the Yucatan tongue; after which Aguilar interpreted the meaning in Spanish. This slave was afterwards named Donna Marina, and proved very useful in their conferences with the natives.\n\nAt this time the Mexican empire, according to Dr Robertson, was arrived at a pitch of grandeur which no society had ever attained in so short a period. Though it had subsisted only for 130 years, its dominion extended from the north to the south sea, over territories stretching about 500 leagues from east to west, and more than 200 from north to south; comprehending provinces not inferior in fertility, population, and opulence, to any in the torrid zone. Though by nature Montezuma possessed a good deal of courage and resolution; yet from the first moment that the Spaniards appeared on his coast, he displayed symptoms of timidity and embarrassment, and all his subjects were embarrassed as well as himself. The general dismay which took place on this occasion was partly owing to the strange figure the Spaniards made, and the prodigious power of their arms; but partly also to the following circumstance. An opinion prevailed almost universally among the Americans, that some dreadful calamity impended over their heads, from a race of formidable invaders who should come from regions towards the rising sun, to overrun and defoliate their country.\n\nBy means of his two interpreters, Donna Marina and Aguilar, Cortes learned that the chiefs of the Mexican embassy were deputies from Piltzaco and Teutle; the one governor of a province under the emperor, and the other the commander of all his forces in that province: the purport of their embassy was to inquire what his intentions were in visiting their coasts, and to offer him what assistance he might need in order to continue his voyage. Cortes, in his turn, also professed the greatest friendship; and informed the ambassadors, that he came to propose matters of the utmost consequence to the welfare of the prince and his kingdom; which he would more fully unfold in person to the governor and the general. Next morning, without waiting for any answer, he landed his troops, his horses, and his artillery; began to erect huts for his men, and to fortify his camp.\n\nThe next day the ambassadors had a formal audience; at which Cortes acquainted them, that he came from Don Carlos of Austria, king of Castile, the greatest monarch of the east, and was intrusted with propositions of such moment, that he would impart them to none but the emperor himself, and therefore required to be conducted immediately to the capital. This demand produced the greatest uneasiness;\nand the ambassadors did all in their power to dissuade Cortes from his design, endeavouring to conciliate his good will by the presents sent him by Montezuma. These they introduced with great parade, and consisted of fine cotton cloth, of plumes of various colours, and of ornaments of gold and silver to a considerable value, the workmanship of which appeared to be as curious as the materials were rich. But these presents served only to excite the avidity of the Spaniards, and to increase their desire for becoming masters of a country which abounded with so many precious commodities. Cortes indeed could scarcely restrain himself so far as to hear the arguments made use of by the ambassadors to dissuade him from going to the capital; and, in a haughty, determined tone, insisted on his former demand of being admitted to a personal interview with their sovereign.\n\nDuring this conversation, some painters in the retinue of the Mexican chiefs had been diligently employed in delineating, upon white cotton cloths, figures of the ships, horses, artillery, soldiers, and whatever else attracted their eyes as singular.\n\nWhile exerting their utmost efforts in representing all these wonderful things, messengers were immediately dispatched to Montezuma with the pictures, and a full account of everything that had passed since the arrival of the Spaniards, together with some European curiosities to Montezuma; which Cortes believed would be acceptable on account of their novelty. The Mexican monarchs had couriers posted at proper stations along the principal roads; and as these were trained to agility by a regular education, they conveyed intelligence with surprising rapidity. Though the city in which Montezuma resided was above 180 miles from St Juan de Ulua, Cortes' presents were carried thither, and an answer returned to his demands, in a few days. As the answer was unfavourable, Montezuma had endeavoured to mollify the Spanish general by the richness of his presents. These consisted of the manufactures of the country; cotton stuffs so fine, and of such delicate texture, as to resemble silk; pictures of animals, trees, and other natural objects, formed with feathers of different colours, disposed and mingled with such skill and elegance as to rival the works of the pencil in truth and beauty of imitation. But what chiefly attracted their attention, were two large plates of a circular form; one of malleable gold representing the sun, the other of silver representing the moon. These were accompanied with bracelets, collars, rings, and other trinkets of gold; and that nothing might be wanting which could give the Spaniards a complete idea of what the country afforded, some boxes filled with pearls, precious stones, and grains of gold unwrought, as they had been found in the mines or rivers, were sent along with the rest. Cortes received all with an appearance of the most profound respect for Montezuma; but when the Mexicans, presuming upon this, informed him, that their matter, though he desired him to accept of what he had sent as a token of his regard for the prince whom he represented, would not give his consent that foreign troops should approach nearer to his capital, or even allow them to continue longer in his dominions, Cortes declared, in a manner more resolute and peremptory than formerly, that he must insist on his first demand; as he could not, without dishonour, return to his own sovereign until he was admitted into the presence of the prince whom he was appointed to visit in his name.\n\nThe pusillanimity of the Indian monarch afforded time to the Spaniards to take measures which would have been out of their power had they been vigorously attacked on their first refusal to obey his orders. Cortes used every method of securing the affections of the soldiers; which indeed was very necessary, as many of them began to complain against the rashness of his attempt in leading them against the whole force of the Mexican empire. In a short time Texitle ar Montezuma arrived with another present from Montezuma, and accompanying with it delivered the ultimate orders of that monarch to depart instantly out of his dominions; and to leave his when Cortes, instead of complying with his demands, dominions renewed his request of audience, the Mexican immediately left the camp with strong marks of surprise and resentment. Next morning, none of the natives appeared; all friendly correspondence seemed to be at an end, and hostilities were expected to commence every moment. A sudden consternation ensued among the Spaniards, and a party was formed against him by the adherents of Velasquez; who took advantage of the occasion, and deputed one of their number, a principal officer, to remonstrate, as if in name of the whole army, against his rashness, and to urge the necessity of his returning to Cuba. Cortes received the message without any appearance of emotion; and as he well knew the temper and wishes of his soldiery, with much complacency he pretended to comply with the request now made him, and issued orders that the army should be in readiness next day to embark for Cuba. Upon hearing this, the troops, as Cortes had expected, were quite outrageous; they positively refused to comply with these orders, and threatened immediately to choose another general if Cortes continued to insist on their departure.\n\nOur adventurer was highly pleased with the disposition which now appeared among his troops; nevertheless, dissembling his sentiments, he declared, that his orders for embarking had proceeded from a persuasion that it was agreeable to his fellow-soldiers, to whose opinion he had sacrificed his own; but now he acknowledged his error, and was ready to resume his original plan of operation. This speech was highly applauded; and Cortes, without allowing his men time to cool, set about carrying his designs into execution. In order to give a beginning to a colony, he Villa Rica assembled the principal persons in his army, and by founded their suffrages elected a council and magistrates, in whom the government was to be vested. The persons chosen were most firmly attached to Cortes; and the new settlement had the name of Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz; that is, the rich town of the true cross.\n\nBefore this court of his own making, Cortes did not hesitate at refusing all his authority, and was immediately re-elected chief justice of the colony, and captain-general of his army, with an ample command in Cortes million, in the king's name, to continue in force till the royal pleasure should be farther known. The soldiers eagerly ratified their choice by loud acclamations; and Cortes, now considering himself as no longer accountable to any subject, began to assume a\nMexico much greater degree of dignity, and to exercise more extensive powers than he had done before.\n\nCortes having thus strengthened himself as well as he could, resolved to advance into the country; and to this he was encouraged by the behaviour of the cacique or petty prince of Zempoalha, a considerable town at no great distance. Here he was received in the most friendly manner imaginable, and had a respect paid towards him almost equivalent to adoration. The cacique informed him of many particulars relating to the character of Montezuma.\u2014He told him that he was a tyrant, haughty, cruel, and suspicious; who treated his own subjects with arrogance, ruined the conquered provinces by his extortions, and often tore their sons and daughters from them by violence; the former to be offered as victims to his gods, the latter to be reserved as concubines for himself and favourites. Cortes, in reply, artfully intimated, that one great object of the Spaniards in visiting a country so remote from their own was, to redress grievances, and to relieve the oppressed; and having encouraged him to hope for this interposition in due time, continued his march to Quiahtlan, the territory of another cacique, and where, by the friendly aid of the Indians, a Spanish colony was soon formed.\n\nDuring the residence of Cortes in these parts, he so far wrought on the minds of the caciques of Zempoalha and Quiahtlan, that they ventured to infuse the Mexican power, at the very name of which they had been formerly accustomed to tremble. Some of Montezuma's officers having appeared to levy the usual tribute, and to demand a certain number of human victims, as an expiation of their guilt in presuming to hold intercourse with those strangers whom the emperor had commanded to leave his dominions; instead of obeying his orders, they made them prisoners, treated them with great indignity, and, as their superstition was no less barbarous than Montezuma's, they threatened to sacrifice them to their gods.\n\nThough Cortes had now taken such measures as in a manner ensured his success; yet as he had thrown off all dependence on the governor of Cuba, who was his lawful superior, and apprehended his interest at court, he thought proper, before he set out on his intended expedition, to take the most effectual measures against the impending danger. With this view, he persuaded the magistrates of his colony to address a letter to the king, containing a pompous account of their own services, of the country they had discovered, &c. and of the motives which had induced them to throw off their allegiance to the governor of Cuba, and to settle a colony dependent on the crown alone, in which the supreme power, civil as well as military, had been vested in Cortes; humbly requesting their sovereign to ratify what had been done by his royal authority.\n\nSome soldiers and sailors, secretly disaffected to Cortes, formed a design of seizing one of the brigantines, and making their escape to Cuba, in order to give such intelligence to the governor as might enable him to intercept the vessel which was to carry the treasure and despatches to Spain. This conspiracy was conducted with profound secrecy; but at the moment when every thing was ready for execution, the secret was discovered by one of the associates. The latent spirit of disaffection which Cortes was now too well convinced had not been extinguished amongst his troops, gave him very great uneasiness. The only method which he could think of to prevent such conspiracies for the future was to destroy his fleet, and thus deprive his soldiers of every resource except that of conquest; and with this proposal he persuaded his men to comply. With universal consent therefore the ships were drawn ashore, and, after being stripped of their sails, rigging, iron work, and whatever else might be of use, they were broke in pieces.\n\nCortes having thus rendered it necessary for his troops to follow wherever he chose to lead, began his march to Zempoalha with 500 infantry, 15 horses, and six field pieces. The rest of his troops being left fit for active service, he left them as a garrison in Villa Rica, under the command of Escalante, an officer of merit, and warmly attached to his interest. The cacique of Zempoalha supplied him with provisions; and with 200 of those Indians called Tamales, whose office, in a country where tame animals were unknown, was to carry burdens, and perform all manner of servile labour. He offered likewise a considerable body of troops; but Cortes was satisfied with 400; taking care, however, to choose persons of such note, that they might serve as hostages for the fidelity of their master.\n\nNothing memorable happened till the Spaniards arrived on the confines of the republic of Tlataca. The inhabitants of that province were warlike, fierce, and revengeful, and had made considerable progress in agriculture and some other arts. They were implacable enemies to Montezuma; and therefore Cortes hoped that it would be an easy matter for him to procure their friendship. With this view, four messengers of high rank were sent ambassadors to Tlataca, dressed with all the badges of that office among the Indians. The senate were divided in their opinions with regard to the proposals of Cortes; but at last Magificatzin, one of the oldest senators, and a person of great authority, mentioned the tradition of their ancestors, and the revelations of their priests; that a race of invincible men, of divine origin, who had power over the elements, should come from the east to subdue their country. He compared the resemblance which the strangers bore to the persons figured in the traditions of Mexico, their dominion over the elements of fire, air, and water; he reminded the senate of their prodigies, omens, and signals, which had lately terrified the Mexicans, and indicated some very important event; and then declared his opinion, that it would be rashness to oppose a force apparently assisted by heaven, and men who had already proved, to the sad experience of those who opposed them, that they were invincible. This orator was opposed by Xicotencal, who endeavoured to prove that the Spaniards were at best but powerful magicians: that they had rendered themselves obnoxious to the gods by pulling down their images and altars, (which indeed Cortes had very imprudently done at Zempoalha); and of consequence, that they might easily be overcome, as the gods would not fail to resent such an outrage. He therefore voted for war, and advised the crushing of these invaders at one blow.\n\nThe advice of Xicotencal prevailed; and in consequence of it, the ambassadors were detained; which\ngiving Cortes the alarm, he drew nearer the city of Tlascalca. They suffered him with his army drawn up in good order, to pass a strong wall between two mountains, which might have been very advantageously defended against him. He had not advanced far beyond this pass, however, before a party of Tlascalans with plumes were discovered, which denoted that an army was in the field. These he drove before him by a detachment of six horse, obliged them to join another party, and then reinforcing the advanced detachment, charged the enemy with such vigour that they began to retire. Five thousand Tlascalans then rushed out of their hiding places, just as the infantry came up to assist their slender body of cavalry. The enemy attacked with the utmost fury; but were so much disconcerted by the first discharge of the firearms, that they retreated in confusion, furnishing the Spaniards with an opportunity of pursuing them with great slaughter. Cortes, however, supposing that this could not be their whole force, advanced with the utmost caution, in order of battle, to an eminence, from whence he had a view of the main body of the Tlascalan army commanded by Xicotencatl, consisting of no fewer than 40,000 men. By these the small army of Cortes was entirely surrounded; which Xicotencatl no sooner perceived, than he contracted the circle with incredible diligence, while the Spaniards were almost overwhelmed with showers of arrows, darts, and stones. It is impossible but in this case many of the Spaniards must have perished, had it not been for the insufficiency of the Indian weapons. This circumstance gave the Spaniards a prodigious advantage over them; and therefore the Tlascalans, notwithstanding their valour and superiority in number, could accomplish no more in the present instance, than to kill one horse and lightly wound nine soldiers.\n\nThe Tlascalans being taught by this, and some subsequent encounters, how much they were inferior to the Spaniards, began to conceive them to be really what Magicatzin had said; a superior order of beings, against whom human power could not prevail. In this extremity they had recourse to their priests, requiring them to reveal the causes of such extraordinary events, and to declare what means they should take to repel such formidable invaders. The priests, after many sacrifices and incantations, delivered their response, That these strangers were the offspring of the sun, procreated by his animating energy in the regions of the east: that, by day, while cherished with the influence of his parental beams, they were invincible; but by night, when his reviving heat was withdrawn, their vigour declined and faded like herbs in the field, and they dwindled down into mortal men. In consequence of this, the Tlascalans acted in contradiction to one of their most established maxims in war, and ventured to attack the enemy in the night time, hoping to destroy them when enfeebled and surprised. But the Spanish centinels having observed some extraordinary movements among the Tlascalans, gave the alarm. Immediately the troops were under arms, and falling out, defeated their antagonists with great slaughter, without allowing them to approach the camp. By this disaster the Tlascalans were heartily disposed to peace; but they were at a loss to form an adequate idea of the enemies they had to deal with. They could not ascertain the nature of these surprising beings, or whether they were really of a benevolent or malignant disposition. There were circumstances in their behaviour which seemed to favour each opinion. On the one hand, as the Spaniards constantly dismissed the prisoners whom they took, not only without injury, but often with presents of European toys, and renewed their offers of peace after every victory; this lenity amazed people accustomed to the exterminating system of war known in America, and who sacrificed and devoured without mercy all the captives taken in battle; and disposed them to entertain sentiments favourable to their humanity. But, on the other hand, as Cortes had seized 50 of their countrymen who brought provisions to their camp, and cut off their heads; this bloody spectacle, added to the terror occasioned by the firearms and horses, filled them with dreadful ideas of their ferocity. Accordingly they addressed them in the following manner: \"If (said they) you are divinities of a cruel and savage nature, we present to you five slaves, that you may drink their blood and eat their flesh. If you are mild deities, accept an offering of incense and variegated plumes. If you are men, here is meat, bread, and fruit, to nourish you.\" Which is After this address, the peace was soon concluded, to granted, the great satisfaction of both parties. The Tlascalans yielded themselves as vassals to the crown of Castile, and engaged to assist Cortes in all his operations; while he took the republic under his protection, and promised to defend their persons and possessions from injury and violence.\n\nCortes left no method untried to gain the favour and confidence of the Tlascalans; which, however, he had almost entirely lost, by his untimely zeal in destroying their idols as he had done those of Zempoala. But he was deterred from this rash action by his chaplain Father Bartholomew de Olmedo; and left the Tlascalans in the undisturbed exercise of their superstition, requiring only that they should desist from their horrid practice of offering human victims. As soon as his troops were fit for service, he resolved to continue his march towards Mexico, notwithstanding the remonstrances of the Tlascalans, who looked upon his destruction as unavoidable if he put himself into the power of such a faithless prince as Montezuma. But the emperor, or, probably intimidated with the fame of his exploits, had resolved to admit his visit; and informed Cortes that he had given orders for his friendly reception at Cholula, the next place of any consequence on the road to Mexico. Cortes was received with much seeming cordiality; but 6000 Tlascalan troops who accompanied him were of Montezuma obliged to remain without the town, as the Cholulans refused to admit their ancient enemies within their precincts. Yet two of these, by disguising themselves, got into the city, and acquainted Cortes that they observed the women and children belonging to the principal citizens retiring every night in a great hurry, and that six children had been sacrificed in the great temple; a sign that some warlike enterprise was at hand. At the same time Donna Marina, the interpreter, received information from an Indian woman of distinction, whose confidence she had gained, that the destruction of the Spaniards was concerted; that a body of Mexican troops lay concealed near the town; that some of the streets were barricaded, in others deep pits or trenches were dug,\ndug, and slightly covered over, as traps into which the horse might fall; that stones and missile weapons were collected on the tops of the temples, with which to overwhelm the infantry; that the fatal hour was already at hand, and their ruin unavoidable. Cortes, alarmed at this news, secretly arrested three of the chief priests, from whom he extorted a confession that confirmed the intelligence he had already received. As not a moment was to be lost, he instantly resolved to prevent his enemies, and to inflict on them such dreadful vengeance as might strike Montezuma and his subjects with terror.\n\nOn a signal given, the troops rushed out, and fell upon the multitude, destitute of leaders, and so much astonished, that the weapons dropped from their hands, and they stood motionless, and incapable of defence. While the Spaniards attacked them in front, the Tlacalans did the same in the rear; the streets were filled with slaughter; the temples, which afforded a retreat to the priests and some leading men, were set on fire, and they perished in the flames. At length the carnage ceased, after the slaughter of 6000 Cholulans, without the loss of a single Spaniard. Cortes then released the magistrates; and reproaching them bitterly for their intended treachery, declared, that as justice was now appeased, he forgave the offence; but required them to recall the inhabitants who had fled, and re-establish order in the town.\n\nFrom Cholula, Cortes advanced directly towards Mexico; and throughout the whole of his journey was entertained with accounts of the oppressions and cruelty of Montezuma. This gave him the greatest hope of accomplishing his design; as he now perceived that the empire was entirely divided, and no sort of unanimity prevailed among them. No enemy appeared to check his progress. Montezuma was quite irrefutable; and Cortes was almost at the gates of the capital before the emperor had determined whether to receive him as a friend or oppose him as an enemy. But as no sign of open hostility appeared, the Spaniards, without regarding the fluctuations of Montezuma's sentiments, continued their march to Mexico, with great circumspection and the strictest discipline, though without seeming to suspect the prince whom they were about to visit.\n\nWhen they drew near the city, about 1000 persons, who appeared to be of distinction, came forth to meet them, adorned with plumes, and clad in mantles of fine cotton. Each of these, in his order, passed by Cortes, and saluted him according to the mode deemed most respectful and submissive in their country. They announced the approach of Montezuma himself, and soon after his harbingers came in sight. There appeared first 200 persons in an uniform dress, with large plumes of feathers, alike in fashion, marching two and two, in deep silence, barefooted, with their eyes fixed on the ground. These were followed by a company of higher rank, in their most showy apparel: in the midst of whom was Montezuma, in a chair or litter richly ornamented with gold and feathers of various colours. Four of his principal favourites carried him on their shoulders, others supported a canopy of curious workmanship over his head. Before him marched three officers with rods of gold in their hands, which they lifted up on high at certain intervals; and at that signal all the people bowed their heads, and hid their faces, as unworthy to look on so great a monarch.\n\nWhen he drew near, Cortes dismounting, advanced towards him with officious haste, and in a respectful posture. At the same time Montezuma alighted from his chair, and leaning on the arms of two of his near relations, approached with a slow and stately pace, his attendants covering the street with cotton cloths, that he might not touch the ground. Cortes accosted him with profound reverence, after the European fashion. He returned the salutation, according to the mode of his country, by touching the earth with his hand, and then kissing it. This ceremony appeared such amazing condescension in a proud monarch, who scarcely deigned to consider the rest of mankind as of the same species with himself, that all his subjects firmly believed those persons, before whom he humbled himself in this manner, to be something more than human. Accordingly, as they marched through the crowd, the Spaniards frequently, and with much satisfaction, heard themselves denominated teules, or divinities. Nothing material palled in this first interview. Montezuma conducted Cortes to the quarters which he had prepared for his reception; and immediately took leave of him with a politeness not unworthy of a court more refined: \"You are now (says he), with your brothers, in your own house; refresh yourselves after your fatigue, and be happy until I return.\" The place allotted to the Spaniards for their lodging was a house built by the father of Montezuma. It was surrounded by a stone wall, with towers at proper distances, which served for defence as well as for ornament; and its apartments and courts were so large as to accommodate both the Spaniards and their Indian allies. The first care of Cortes was to take precautions for his security, by planting the artillery so as to command the different avenues which led to it, by appointing a large division of his troops to be always on guard, and by posting sentinels at proper stations, with injunctions to observe the same vigilant discipline as if they were within sight of an enemy's camp.\n\nIn the evening Montezuma returned to visit his guests with the same pomp as in their first interview; and brought presents of such value, not only to Cortes and to his officers, but even to the private men, as proved the liberality of the monarch to be suitable to the opulence of his kingdom. A long conference ensued, in which Cortes learned what was the opinion of Montezuma with respect to the Spaniards. It was an established tradition, he told him, among the Mexicans, that their ancestors came originally from a remote region, and conquered the provinces now subject to his dominion; that after they were settled there, the great captain who conducted this colony returned to his own country, promising, that at some future period his descendants should visit them, assume the government, and reform their constitutions and laws; that, from what he had heard and seen of Cortes and his followers, he was convinced that they were the very persons whose appearance their prophecies taught them to expect; that accordingly he had received them, not as strangers, but as relations of the same blood and parentage, and desired that they might consider themselves as masters in his dominions; for both himself and his subjects should be ready to comply with their will, and even to prevent their wishes. Cortes made a reply\nply in his usual style with respect to the dignity and power of his sovereign, and his intention in sending him into that country; artfully endeavouring so to frame his discourse, that it might coincide as much as possible with the idea which Montezuma had formed concerning the origin of the Spaniards. Next morning, Cortes and some of his principal attendants were admitted to a public audience of the emperor. The three subsequent days were employed in viewing the city; the appearance of which, so far superior in the order of its buildings and the number of its inhabitants to any place the Spaniards had beheld in America, and yet so little resembling the structure of an European city, filled them with surprise and admiration.\n\nMexico is situated in a large plain, environed by mountains of such height, that though within the torrid zone, the temperature of its climate is mild and healthful. All the moisture which descends from the high grounds is collected in several lakes, the two largest of which, of about 90 miles in circuit, communicate with each other. The waters of the one are fresh, those of the other brackish. On the banks of the latter, and on some small islands adjoining to them, the capital of Montezuma's empire was built. The access to the city was by artificial causeways or streets, formed of stones and earth, about 30 feet in breadth. As the waters of the lake, during the rainy season, overflowed the flat country, these causeways were of considerable length. That of Tacuba on the west a mile and a half; that of Tezcuco on the north-west three miles; that of Cuoya can towards the south six miles. On the east there was no causeway, and the city could be approached only by canoes. In each of these causeways were openings at proper intervals, through which the waters flowed; and over these beams of timber were laid, which being covered with earth, the causeway or street had everywhere an uniform appearance. As the approaches to the city were singular, its construction was remarkable. Not only the temples of their gods, but the houses belonging to the monarch, and to persons of distinction, were of such dimensions, that in comparison with any other buildings which had been discovered in America, they might be termed magnificent. The habitations of the common people were mean, resembling the huts of other Indians. But they were all placed in a regular manner, on the banks of the canals which passed through the city, in some of its districts, or on the sides of the streets which intersected it in other quarters. In several places were large openings or squares, one of which, allotted for the great market, is said to have been so spacious that 40,000 or 50,000 persons carried on traffic there. In this city, the pride of the New World, and the noblest monument of the industry and art of man, while unacquainted with the use of iron, the Spaniards, who are most moderate in their computations, reckon that there were at least 60,000 inhabitants.\n\nBut how much soever the novelty of those objects might amuse or astonish the Spaniards, they felt the utmost solicitude with respect to their own situation. From a concurrence of circumstances, no less unexpected than favourable to their progress, they had been allowed to penetrate into the heart of a powerful kingdom, and were now lodged in its capital, without having once met with open opposition from its monarch. Mexico. The Tlascalans, however, had artfully dissuaded them from placing such confidence in Montezuma as to enter a city of such a peculiar situation as Mexico, where that prince would have them at mercy, shut up as it were in a snare, from which it was impossible to escape. They assured them that the Mexican priests had, in the name of the gods, counselled their sovereign to admit the strangers into the capital, that he might cut them off there at one blow with perfect security. The Spaniards now perceived, too plainly, that the apprehensions of their allies were not destitute of foundation; that, by breaking the bridges placed at certain intervals on the causeways, or by destroying part of the causeways themselves, their retreat would be rendered impracticable, and they must remain cooped up in the centre of a hostile city, surrounded by multitudes sufficient to overwhelm them, and without a possibility of receiving aid from their allies.\n\nBefore he set out from Cholula, Cortes had received some hostile advice from Villa Rica, that Qualpopoca, one of the Mexican generals on the frontiers, having assembled an army in order to attack some of the people whom the Spaniards had encouraged to throw off the Mexican yoke, Ecalante had marched out with part of the garrison to support his allies; that an engagement had ensued, in which, though the Spaniards were victorious, Ecalante, with seven of his men, had been mortally wounded, his horse killed, and one Spaniard had been surrounded by the enemy and taken alive; that the head of this unfortunate captive, after being carried in triumph to different cities, in order to convince the people that their invaders were not immortal, had been sent to Mexico. Cortes, though alarmed with this intelligence, as an indication of Montezuma's hostile intentions, had continued his march. But as soon as he entered Mexico he became sensible, that, from an excess of confidence in the superior valour and discipline of his troops, as well as from the disadvantage of having nothing to guide him in an unknown country but the defective intelligence which he received from people with whom his mode of communication was very imperfect, he had pushed forward into a situation, where it was difficult to continue, and from which it was dangerous to retire. Disgrace, and perhaps ruin, was the certain consequence of attempting the latter. The success of his enterprise depended upon supporting the high opinion which the people of New Spain had formed with respect to the irresistible power of his arms. Upon the first symptom of timidity on his part, their veneration would cease, and Montezuma, whom fear alone restrained at present, would let loose upon him the whole force of his empire. At the same time, he knew that the countenance of his own sovereign was to be obtained only by a series of victories; and that nothing but the merit of extraordinary success could screen his conduct from the censure of irregularity. From all these considerations, it was necessary to maintain his station, and to extricate himself out of the difficulties in which one bold step had involved him, by venturing upon another still bolder. The situation was trying, but his mind was equal to it; and after revolving the matter with deep attention, he fixed upon a plan so novel as to be extraordinary than daring. He determined to seize Montezuma in his palace, and carry him a prisoner to the his palace.\nthe Spanish quarters. From the superstitious veneration of the Mexicans for the person of their monarch, as well as their implicit submission to his will, he hoped, by having Montezuma in his power, to acquire the supreme direction of their affairs; or at least, with such a sacred pledge in his hands, he made no doubt of being secure from any effort of their violence.\n\nThis he immediately propofoed to his officers. The timid started at a measure so audacious, and raised objections. The more intelligent and resolute, conscious that it was the only resource in which there appeared any prospect of safety, warmly approved of it, and brought over their companions so cordially to the same opinion, that it was agreed instantly to make the attempt. At his usual hour of visiting Montezuma, Cortes went to the palace, accompanied by Alvarado, Sandoval, Lugo, Velasquez de Leon, and Davila, five of his principal officers, and as many trusty soldiers. Thirty chosen men followed, not in regular order, but sauntering at some distance, as if they had no object but curiosity; small parties were posted at proper intervals, in all the streets leading from the Spanish quarters to the court; and the remainder of his troops, with the Tlascalan allies, were under arms, ready to fall out on the first alarm. Cortes and his attendants were admitted without suspicion; the Mexicans retiring, as usual, out of respect. He addressed the monarch in a tone very different from that which he had employed in former conferences; reproaching him bitterly as the author of the violent assault made upon the Spaniards by one of his officers, and demanding public reparation for the loss which he had sustained by the death of some of his companions, as well as for the insult offered to the great prince whose servants they were. Montezuma, confounded at this unexpected accusation, and changing colour either from the consciousness of guilt, or from feeling the indignity with which he was treated, asserted his own innocence with great earnestness; and, as proof of it, gave orders instantly to bring Qualpopoca and his accomplices prisoners to Mexico. Cortes replied, with seeming complaisance, that a declaration so respectable left no doubt remaining in his own mind; but that something more was requisite to satisfy his followers, who would never be convinced that Montezuma did not harbour hostile intentions against them, unless, as an evidence of his confidence and attachment, he removed from his own palace and took up his residence in the Spanish quarters, where he should be served and honoured as became a great monarch. The first mention of so strange a proposal bereaved Montezuma of speech, and almost of motion. At length he haughtily answered, \"That persons of his rank were not accustomed voluntarily to give up themselves as prisoners; and were he mean enough to do so, his subjects would not permit such an affront to be offered to their sovereign.\" Cortes, unwilling to employ force, endeavoured alternately to soothe and intimidate him. The altercation became warm; and having continued above three hours, Velasquez de Leon, an impetuous and gallant young man, exclaimed with impatience, \"Why waste more time in vain? Let us either seize him instantly, or stab him to the heart?\" The threatening voice and fierce gestures with which these words were uttered, struck Montezuma. The Spaniards, he was sensible, had now proceeded so far, as left him no hope that they would recede. His own danger was imminent, the necessity unavoidable. He saw both; and abandoning himself to his fate, complied with their request.\n\nHis officers were called. He communicated to them the importance of his resolution. Though astonished and afflicted, they carried him in silent pomp, all bathed in tears, to the Spanish quarters.\n\nThey at first pretended to treat Montezuma with great respect; but soon took care to let him know that he was entirely in their power. Cortes wished that the shedding the blood of a Spaniard should appear the most heinous crime that could be committed; and therefore not only took a most exemplary vengeance on those who had been concerned in the affair of Villa Rica, but even put the emperor himself in chains till the execution of the Mexican general was over. By these, and other insults, he at last gained the entire ascendancy over this unhappy monarch; and he took care to improve his opportunity to the utmost. He sent his emissaries into different parts of the kingdom, accompanied with Mexicans of distinction, who might serve both to guide and to protect them. They visited most of the provinces, viewed their soil and productions, surveyed with particular care the districts which yielded gold or silver, pitched upon several places as proper for future colonies, and endeavoured to prepare the minds of the people for submitting to the Spanish yoke; and while they were thus employed, Cortes, in the name and by the authority of Montezuma, degraded some of the principal officers in the empire, whose abilities or independent spirit excited his jealousy; and substituted in their place persons who he imagined would be more obsequious. One thing, however, was still wanting to complete his security. He wished to have such a command of the lake as might ensure a retreat, if, either from levity or disaffection, the Mexicans should take arms against him, and break down the bridges or causeways, in order to enclose him in the city. In order to obtain this without giving disaffection to the emperor or his court, obtains Cortes artfully inflamed the curiosity of the Indians with accounts of the Spanish shipping, and those floating palaces that moved with such velocity on the water, without the assistance of oars; and when he found that the monarch himself was extremely desirous of seeing such a novelty, he gave him to understand, that nothing was wanting to its gratification besides a few necessaries from Vera Cruz, for that he had workmen in his army capable of building such vessels. The bait took with Montezuma; and he gave immediate orders that all his people should assist Cortes in whatever he should direct concerning the shipping. By this means, in a few days, two brigantines were got ready, full rigged and equipped; and Montezuma was invited on board, to make the first trial of their sailing, of which he could form no idea. Accordingly he embarked for this purpose, and gave orders for a great hunting upon the water, in order that all his people might be diverted with the novelty presented by the Spaniards. On the day appointed, the royal equipage was ready early in the morning; and the lake was covered with a multitude of boats and canoes loaded with people. The Mexicans had augmented\nMexico. the number of their rowers on board the royal barges, with an intention to disgrace the Spanish vessels, which they regarded as clumsy, unwieldy, and heavy. But they were soon undeceived; a fresh gale started up, the brigantines hoisted sail, to the utter astonishment of all the spectators, and soon left all the canoes behind; while the monarch exulted in the victory of the Spaniards, without once considering that now he had effectually riveted his own chains.\n\nCortes having obtained this important point, resolved to put the condescension of the emperor to a trial still more severe. He urged Montezuma to acknowledge himself a vassal to the crown of Castile; to hold his crown of him as superior, and to subject his dominions to the payment of an annual tribute. With this requisition, humiliating as it was, Montezuma complied. He called together the chief men of his empire, and, in a solemn harangue, reminded them of the traditions and prophecies which led them to expect the arrival of a people sprung from the same stock with themselves, in order to take possession of the supreme power; he declared his belief that the Spaniards were this promised race; and that therefore he recognized the right of their monarch to govern the Mexican empire, would lay his crown at his feet, and obey him as a tributary. While uttering these words, Montezuma discovered how deeply he was affected in making such a sacrifice. Tears and groans frequently interrupted his discourse. The first mention of such a resolution struck the assembly dumb with astonishment. This was followed by a sullen murmur of sorrow mingled with indignation; which indicated some violent eruption of rage to be near at hand. This Cortes forewarned, and seasonably interposed to prevent it, by declaring that his master had no intention to deprive Montezuma of the royal dignity, or to make any innovation upon the constitution and laws of the Mexican empire. This assurance, added to their dread of the Spanish arms, and the authority of their monarch's example, extorted the consent of the assembly; and the act of submission and homage was executed with all the formalities which the Spaniards pleaded to prescribe.\n\nMontezuma, at the request of Cortes, accompanied this profession of fealty and homage with a magnificent present to his new sovereign; and, after his example, his subjects brought in very liberal contributions. The Spaniards then collected all the treasure which had been either voluntarily bestowed upon them at different times by Montezuma, or had been extorted from his people under various pretences; and having melted the gold and silver, the value of these amounted to 600,000 pesos. The soldiers were impatient to have it divided; and Cortes complied with their desire. A fifth of the whole was set apart as the tax due to the king. Another fifth was allowed to Cortes as commander. The sums advanced by the governor of Cuba who had originally fitted out the expedition, were then deducted. The remainder was then divided among the army, including the garrison of Vera Cruz, in proportion to their different ranks; and after so many deductions, the share of a private man did not exceed 100 pesos. This sum fell far below their sanguine expectations, that it required all the address, and no small exertions of the liberality of Cortes, to prevent an open mutiny. However, he at last restored tranquillity; but had no sooner escaped this danger, than he involved himself, by his imprudent zeal for religion, in one much worse. Montezuma, though often importuned, had obstinately refused to change his religion, or abolish the superstitious rites which had been for such a long time practised throughout his dominions. This at last transported the Spaniard with such rage, that, in a folly of zeal, he led out his soldiers in order to throw down the idols in the great temple by force. But the priests, taking arms in defence of their altars, and the people crowding with great ardour to support them, Cortes's prudence overruled his zeal, and induced him to desist from his rash attempt, after dislodging the idols from one of the shrines, and placing in their stead an image of the Virgin Mary.\n\nFrom this moment the Mexicans began to meditate which proved fatal to the captive monarch, it was thought proper first to try more gentle means. Having called Cortes into his presence, he observed, that now, as all the purposes of his embassy were fully accomplished, the gods had declared their will, and the people signified their desire, that he and his followers should instantly depart out of the empire. With this command he required them to comply, or unavoidable destruction would fall suddenly on their heads. This unexpected requisition, as well as the manner in which it was delivered, alarmed Cortes. However, he supposed that more might be gained by a feigned compliance than by open resistance; and therefore replied with great composure, that he had already begun to prepare for his return; but as he had destroyed the vessels in which he arrived, some time was requisite for building other ships. This appeared reasonable; and a number of Mexicans were sent to Vera Cruz to cut down timber, and some Spanish carpenters were appointed to superintend the work.\n\nCortes flattered himself, that, during this interval, he might either find means to avert the threatened danger, or receive such reinforcements as would enable him to defend himself. Nine months had now elapsed since Portocarrero and Montejo had failed with his despatches to Spain; and he daily expected a return, with a confirmation of his authority from the king, without which all that he had done served only to mark him out as an object of punishment. While he remained in great anxiety on this account, news were brought that some ships had appeared on the coast. These were imagined by Cortes to be a reinforcement sent him from Spain; but his joy was of short continuance, for a courier very soon arrived from Vera Cruz, with certain information that the armament was fitted out by Velasquez, the governor of Cuba; and instead of bringing succours, threatened them with immediate destruction.\n\nVelasquez had been excited to this hostile measure chiefly through the indiscretion, or rather treachery, of the messengers of Cortes; who, contrary to his express injunctions, had landed on the island of Cuba, and given intelligence of all that had passed; and Velasquez, transported with rage at hearing of the proceedings of Cortes, had now sent against him this armament; consisting of 18 ships, which carried 80 horsemen,\nmen, 800 infantry, of which 80 were musketeers, and 120 crossbowmen, commanded by a brave officer named Pamphilo de Narvaez; whose instructions were, to seize Cortes and his principal officers, to send them prisoners to him, and then to complete the discovery and conquest of the country in his name. This proved a most afflicting piece of news to Cortes.\n\nHaving now no resource but in war, he left 150 men under the command of Pedro de Alvarado, an officer of great bravery, and much respected by the Mexicans, to guard the capital and the captive emperor; while he himself marched with the remainder, to meet his formidable opponent, who had taken possession of Zempoalla. Even after being reinforced by Sandoval his governor of Vera Cruz, the force of Cortes did not exceed 250 men. He hoped for success chiefly from the rapidity of his motions and the possibility of surprising his enemies; and as he chiefly dreaded their cavalry, he armed his soldiers with long spears, accustomed them to that deep and compact arrangement which the use of this formidable weapon enabled them to assume. As he advanced, however, he repeated his proposals of accommodation; but these being constantly rejected, and a price set upon his head, he at last attacked Narvaez in the night-time, entirely defeated and took him prisoner, obliging all his troops to own allegiance to himself.\n\nNothing could be more seasonable than this victory, by which Cortes found his army very considerably increased; for most of the soldiers of Narvaez chose rather to follow Cortes than to return to Cuba, whether the conqueror had offered to send them if they chose. His affairs at Mexico, in the mean time, were in the utmost danger of being totally ruined; and had this decisive victory been delayed but a few days longer, he must have come too late to save his companions. A short time after the defeat of Narvaez, a courier arrived from Mexico with the disagreeable intelligence that the Mexicans had taken arms; and having seized and destroyed the two brigantines which he had built in order to secure the command of the lake, had attacked the Spaniards in their quarters, killed some, and wounded many more, burnt their magazine of provisions, and, in short, carried on hostilities with such fury, that though Alvarado and his men defended themselves with undaunted resolution, they must either be cut off by famine, or sink under the multitude of their enemies. This revolt was excited by motives which rendered it still more alarming. On the departure of Cortes for Zempoalla, the Mexicans flattered themselves, that the long-expected opportunity of restoring their sovereign to liberty, and driving out the Spaniards, was arrived; and consultations were accordingly held for bringing about both these events. The Spaniards in Mexico, conscious of their own weakness, suspected and dreaded these machinations; but Alvarado, who had neither the prudence nor the address of Cortes, took the worst method imaginable to overcome them. Instead of attempting to soothe or cajole the Mexicans, he waited the return of one of their solemn festivals, when the principal persons in the empire were dancing, according to custom, in the court of the great temple; he seized all the avenues which led to it; and, allyred partly by the rich ornaments which they wore in honour of their gods, and partly by the facility of cutting off at once the authors of that conspiracy which he dreaded, he fell upon them, unarmed and unsuspicous of danger, and massacred a great number; none escaping but such as made their way over the battlements of the temple. An action so cruel and treacherous filled not only the city, but the whole empire, with indignation and rage; and the Mexicans immediately proceeded in the manner above mentioned.\n\nCortes advanced with the utmost celerity to the relief of his distressed companions: but as he passed along, had the mortification to find that the Spaniards were generally held in abhorrence. The principal inhabitants had deserted the towns through which he passed; no person of note appeared to meet him with the usual respect; nor were provisions brought to his camp as usual. Notwithstanding these signs of aversion and horror, however, the Mexicans were so ignorant of the military art, that they again permitted him to enter the capital without opposition; though it was in their power to have easily prevented him, by breaking down the bridges and causeways which led to it.\n\nCortes was received by his companions with the utmost joy; and this extraordinary success to far intoxicated the general himself, that he not only neglected to visit Montezuma, but expressed himself very contemptuously concerning him. These expressions being reported among the Mexicans, they all at once flew to arms, and made such a violent and sudden attack, that all the valour and skill of Cortes were scarce sufficient to repel them. This produced great uneasiness among the soldiers of Narvaez, who had imagined there was nothing to do but to gather the spoils of a conquered country. Discontent and murmurings, however, were now of no avail; they were enclosed in a hostile city, and, without some extraordinary exertions, were inevitably undone. Cortes therefore, made a desperate sally; but, after exerting his utmost efforts for a whole day, was obliged to retire with the loss of 12 killed, and upwards of 60 wounded. Another sally was attempted with the like bad success, and in it Cortes himself was wounded in the hand.\n\nThe Spanish general was now thoroughly convinced of his error; and therefore betook himself to the only resource which was left; namely, to try what effect the interposition of Montezuma would have to soothe or overawe his subjects. When the Mexicans approached the next morning to renew the assault, that unfortunate prince, at the mercy of the Spaniards, and reduced to the sad necessity of becoming the instrument of his own disgrace, and of the slavery of his people advanced to the battlements in his royal robes, and with all the pomp in which he used to appear on solemn occasions. At the sight of their sovereign, whom they had been long accustomed to reverence almost as a god, the Mexicans instantly forebore their hostilities, and many prostrated themselves on the ground; but when he addressed them in favour of the Spaniards, and made use of all the arguments he could think of to mitigate their rage, they testified their resentment with loud murmurs; and at length broke forth into a massacre.\nMexico forth with such fury, that before the soldiers, appointed to guard Montezuma, had time to cover him with their shields, he was wounded with two arrows, and a blow on his temple with a stone struck him to the ground. On seeing him fall, the Mexicans instantly fled with the utmost precipitation; but the unhappy monarch, now convinced that he was become an object of contempt even to his own subjects, obstinately refused all nourishment; and thus in a short time ended his days.\n\nOn the death of Montezuma, Cortes having lost all hope of bringing the Mexicans to any terms of peace, prepared for retreat. But his antagonists, having taken possession of a high tower in the great temple, which overlooked the Spanish quarters, and placing there a garrison of their principal warriors, the Spaniards were so much exposed to their missiles, that none could flit without danger of being killed or wounded. From this post, therefore, it was necessary to dislodge them at any rate; and Juan de Escobar, with a large detachment of chosen soldiers, was ordered to make the attack. But Escobar, though a valiant officer, and though he exerted his utmost efforts, was thrice repulsed. Cortes, however, sensible that not only his reputation, but the safety of his army, depended on the success of this assault, caused a buckler to be tied to his arm, as he could not manage it with his wounded hand, and rushed with his drawn sword among the thickest of the combatants. Encouraged by the presence of their general, the Spaniards returned to the charge with such vigour, that they gradually forced their way up the steps, and drove the Mexicans to the platform at the top of the tower. There a dreadful carnage began; when two young Mexicans of high rank, observing Cortes, as he animated his soldiers, resolved to sacrifice their own lives in order to cut off the author of so many calamities which desolated their country. They approached him in a suppliant posture, as if they intended to lay down their arms; and seizing him in a moment, hurried him towards the battlements, over which they threw themselves headlong, in hopes of dragging him along with them. But Cortes, by his strength and agility, disengaged himself from their grasp; so that the two Mexicans perished alone.\n\nAs soon as the Spaniards became masters of the tower, they set fire to it, and without further molestation continued the preparations for their retreat. This became the more necessary, as their enemies, astonished at this last effort of their valour, had now entirely changed their system of hostility; and, instead of incessant attacks, endeavoured, by barricading the streets, and breaking down the causeways, to cut off the communication of the Spaniards with the continent, and thus to starve an enemy whom they could not subdue. The first point to be determined, was whether they should march out openly in the face of day, when they could discern every danger, or whether they should endeavour to retire secretly in the night. The latter was preferred, partly from hopes that the superstition of the Mexicans would prevent them from attacking them in the night, and partly from their own superstition in giving credit to the predictions of a private soldier, who pretended to astrology, and assured them of success if they retreated in this manner.\n\nTowards midnight, therefore, they began their march, Mexico in three divisions. Sandoval led the van; Pedro Alvarado and Velazquez de Leon had the conduct of the rear; and Cortes commanded in the centre, where he placed the prisoners, among whom were a son and two daughters of Montezuma, together with several Mexicans of distinction, the artillery, baggage, and a portable bridge of timber intended to be laid over the breaches in the causeway. They marched in profound silence along the causeway which led to Tacuba, because it was shorter than any of the rest, and, lying most remote from the road towards Tlacalala and the sea coast, had been left most entire by the Mexicans.\n\nThey reached the first breach in the causeway without molestation, hoping that their retreat was undisturbed with covered. But the Mexicans had not only watched all their motions, but made preparations for a formidable attack. While the Spaniards were intent upon placing their bridges in the breach, and occupied in conducting their horses and artillery along it, they were suddenly alarmed with the sound of warlike instruments, and found themselves assaulted on all sides by an innumerable multitude of enemies. Unfortunately the wooden bridge was wedged too fast in the mud by the weight of the artillery, that it was impossible to remove it. Dismayed at this accident, the Spaniards advanced with precipitation to the second breach. The Mexicans hemmed them in on every side; and though they defended themselves with their usual courage, yet, crowded as they were in a narrow causeway, their discipline and military skill were of little avail; nor did the obscurity of the night allow them to derive much advantage from their firearms or the superiority of their other weapons. At last the Spaniards, overcome with the numbers of their enemies, began to give way, and in a moment the confusion was universal. Cortes, with about 100 foot soldiers, and a few horse, forced his way over the two remaining breaches in the causeway, the bodies of the dead serving to fill up the chasms, and reached the main land. Having formed them as soon as they arrived, he returned with such as were yet capable of service, to assist his friends in their retreat. He met with part of his soldiers who had forced their way through the enemy, but found many more overwhelmed by the multitude of their aggressors, or perishing in the lake; and heard the grievous lamentations of others whom the Mexicans were carrying off in triumph to be sacrificed to the god of war.\n\nIn this fatal retreat more than one half of Cortes's army perished, together with many officers of distinction. All the artillery, ammunition, and baggage, were lost; the greater part of the horses and above 2000 Tlacalans were killed, and only a very small part of their treasure saved. The first care of the Spanish general was to find some shelter for his wearied troops; for, as the Mexicans infested them on every side, and the people of Tacuba began to take arms, he could not continue in his present station. At last he discovered a temple seated on an eminence, in which he found not only the shelter he wanted, but some provisions; and though the enemy did not intermit their attacks throughout the day, they were without much difficulty prevented from making any impression. For\nMexico six days after, they continued their march through a barren, ill cultivated, and thinly peopled country, where they were often obliged to feed on berries, roots, and the stalks of green maize; at the same time they were harafted without intermission by large parties of Mexicans, who attacked them on all sides. On the fifth day they reached Otumba, not far from the road between Mexico and Tlalcalca. Early next morning they began to advance towards it, flying parties of the enemy still hanging on their rear; and amidst the insults with which they accompanied their hostilities, Donna Marina remarked, that they often exclaimed with exultation, \"Go on, robbers; go to the place where you shall quickly meet the vengeance due to your crimes.\" The meaning of this threat the Spaniards did not comprehend, until they reached the summit of an eminence before them. There a spacious valley opened to their view, covered with a vast army as far as the eye could reach. The Mexicans, while with one body of their troops they harafted the Spaniards in their retreat, had assembled their principal force on the other side of the lake; and marching along the road which led directly to Tlalcalca, posted it in the plain of Otumba, through which they knew Cortes must pass. At the sight of this incredible multitude, which they could survey at once from the rising ground, the Spaniards were astonished, and even the boldest began to despair. But Cortes, without allowing their fears time to operate, after warning them briefly that no alternative remained but to conquer or die, led them instantly to the charge. The Mexicans waited their approach with unusual fortitude: yet such was the superiority of the Spanish discipline and arms, that the impression of this small body was irresistible; and whichever way its force was directed, it penetrated and dispersed the most numerous battalions. But while these gave way in one quarter, new combatants advanced from another; and the Spaniards, though successful in every attack, were ready to sink under these repeated efforts, without seeing any end to their toil, or any hope of victory. At that time Cortes observed the great standard of the empire, which was carried before the Mexican general, advancing; and fortunately recollecting to have heard, that on the fate of it depended the event of every battle, he assembled a few of his bravest officers, whose horses were still capable of service, and, placing himself at their head, pushed towards the standard with such impetuosity that he bore down everything before him. A chosen body of nobles, who guarded the standard, made some resistance, but were soon broken. Cortes, with a stroke of his lance, wounded the Mexican general, and threw him to the ground. One of his followers alighting, put an end to his life, and laid hold of the imperial standard. The moment that their leader fell, and the standard, towards which all directed their eyes, disappeared, an universal panic struck the Mexicans; and, as if the bond which held them together had been dissolved, every ensign was lowered, each soldier threw away his weapons, and fled with precipitation to the mountains. The Spaniards, unable to pursue them far, returned to collect the spoils of the field; and these were so valuable as to be some compensation for the wealth which they had lost in Mexico; for in the enemy's army were most of their principal warriors dressed out in their richest ornaments, as if they had been marching to assured victory.\n\nThe day after this important action (being July 8, 1520), the Spaniards entered the Tlalcalcan territories, where they were received with the most cordial friendship. Cortes endeavoured to avail himself of this disposition as much as possible; for which purpose he distributed among them the rich spoils taken at Otumba with such a liberal hand, that he made himself sure of obtaining from the republic whatever he should desire. He drew a small supply of ammunition, and two or three field-pieces, from his stores at Vera Cruz. He despatched an officer of confidence with four ships of Narvaez's fleet to Hispaniola and Jamaica, to engage adventurers, and to purchase horses, gunpowder, and other military stores. And as he knew that it would be in vain to attempt the reduction of Mexico, unless he could secure the command of the lake, he gave orders to prepare, in the mountains of Tlalcalca, materials for building 12 brigantines, so that they might be carried thither in pieces, ready to be put together, and launched when he stood in need of their service. But, in the mean time, his soldiers, alarmed at the thoughts of being exposed to such calamities a second time, presented a remonstrance to their general, in which they represented the imprudence of attacking a powerful empire with his shattered forces, and formally required him to return back to Cuba. All the eloquence of Cortes could now only prevail with them to delay their departure for some time, when he promised to dismiss such as should desire it. However, this was only a pretence; for Cortes, in fact, had the conquest of Mexico as much at heart as ever. Without giving his soldiers an opportunity of caballing, therefore, he daily employed them against the people of the neighbouring provinces, who had cut off some detachments of Spaniards during his misfortunes at Mexico; and by which, as he was constantly attended with success, his men soon resumed their wonted sense of superiority.\n\nBut all the efforts of Cortes could have been of little avail, had he not unexpectedly obtained a reinforcement of Spanish soldiers. These belonged to an armament fitted out by Francisco de Garay, governor of Jamaica, who had long aimed at dividing with Cortes the glory and gain of annexing the empire of Mexico to the crown of Castile. They had, however, unwisely made their attempt on the northern provinces, where the country was poor and the inhabitants fierce and warlike; so that, after a succession of disasters, they were now obliged to venture into Vera Cruz, and cast themselves upon the mercy of their countrymen; and here they also were soon persuaded to throw off their allegiance to their master, and to enlist with Cortes. About the same time a ship arrived from Spain, freighted by some private adventurers, with military stores; and the cargo was eagerly purchased by Cortes, while the crew, following the example of the rest, joined him at Tlalcalca.\n\nFrom these various quarters, the army of Cortes was augmented with 180 men and 20 horses; by which means he was enabled to dismiss such of the soldiers of Narvaez as were most troublesome and discontented; after the departure of whom he still muttered 550 infantry, of whom 80 were armed with muskets or crossbows.\nMexico.\n\nAt the head of these, with 10,000 Tlascalans and other friendly Indians, he began his march towards Mexico, on the 28th of December, six months after his fatal retreat from that city.\n\nAs soon as Cortes entered the enemy's territories, he discovered various preparations to obstruct his progress. But his troops forced their way with little difficulty; and took possession of Tezcuco, the second city of the empire, situated on the banks of the lake, about 20 miles from Mexico. Here he determined to establish his head-quarters, as the most proper station for launching his brigantines, as well as for making his approaches to the capital. In order to render his residence there more secure, he deposed the cacique or chief, who was at the head of that community, under pretence of some defect in his title, and substituted in his place a person whom a faction of the nobles pointed out as the right heir of that dignity. Attached to him by this benefit, the new cacique and his adherents served the Spaniards with inviolable fidelity.\n\nAs the construction of the brigantines advanced slowly under the unskilful hands of soldiers and Indians, whom Cortes was obliged to employ in afflicting three or four carpenters who happened fortunately to be in his service, and as he had not yet received the reinforcement which he expected from Hispaniola, he was not in a condition to turn his arms directly against the capital. To have attacked a city so populous, so well prepared for defence, and in a situation of such peculiar strength, must have exposed his troops to inevitable destruction. Three months elapsed before the materials for constructing the brigantines were finished, and before he heard anything with respect to the success of his negotiation in Hispaniola. This, however, was not a season of inaction to Cortes. He attacked successively several of the towns situated around the lake; and though all the Mexican power was exerted to obstruct his operations, he either compelled them to submit to the Spanish crown, or reduced them to ruins. Other towns he endeavoured to conciliate by more gentle means; and though he could not hold any intercourse with the inhabitants but by the intervention of interpreters, yet, under all the disadvantages of that tedious and imperfect mode of communication, he had acquired such thorough knowledge of the state of the country, as well as of the dispositions of the people, that he conducted his negotiations and intrigues with astonishing dexterity and success. Most of the cities adjacent to Mexico were originally the capitals of small independent states; and some of them having been but lately annexed to the Mexican empire, still retained the remembrance of their ancient liberty, and bore with impatience the rigorous yoke of their new masters. Cortes having early observed symptoms of their disaffection, availed himself of this knowledge to gain their confidence and friendship. By offering with confidence to deliver them from the odious dominion of the Mexicans, and by liberal promises of more indulgent treatment if they would unite with him against their oppressors, he prevailed on the people of several considerable districts, not only to acknowledge the king of Castile as their sovereign, but to supply the Spanish camp with provisions, and to strengthen his army with auxiliary troops. Guatimozin, on the first appearance of defection among his subjects, exerted himself with vigour to prevent or to punish their revolt; but, in spite of his efforts, the spirit continued to spread. The Spaniards gradually acquired new allies; and with deep concern he beheld Cortes arming against his empire those very hands which ought to have been active in his defence, and ready to advance against the capital at the head of a numerous body of his own subjects.\n\nWhile, by these various methods, Cortes was gradually circumscribing the Mexican power within such narrow limits that his prospect of overturning it seemed neither to be uncertain nor remote, all his schemes were well nigh defeated by a conspiracy against his own person, and which was discovered only a short time before it was to have been executed. Though many were concerned, Cortes did not think proper to punish any more than the principal ringleader, whom he caused immediately to be hanged; and then, without allowing them leisure to ruminate on what had happened, and as the most effectual means of preventing the return of a mutinous spirit, he determined to call forth his troops immediately to action. Fortunately a proper occasion for this occurred, without his seeming to court it. He received intelligence, that the materials for building the brigantines were at length completely finished, and waited only for a body of Spaniards to conduct them to Tezcuco. The command of this convoy, consisting of 200 foot soldiers, 15 horsemen, and two field pieces, he gave to Sandoval, who by the vigilance, activity, and courage, which he manifested on every occasion, was growing daily in his confidence, and in the estimation of his fellow-soldiers. The Tlascalans furnished 8000 Tamezes, an inferior order of men destined for servile tasks, to carry the materials on their shoulders, and appointed 15,000 warriors to accompany and defend them. Sandoval made the disposition for their progress with great propriety, placing the Tamezes in the centre, one body of warriors in the front, another in the rear, with considerable parties to cover the flanks. To each of these he joined some Spaniards, not only to assist them in danger, but to accustom them to regularity and subordination. Parties of Mexicans frequently appeared hovering around them on the high grounds; but perceiving no prospect of success in attacking an enemy continually on his guard, and prepared to receive them, they did not venture to molest him; and Sandoval had the glory of conducting safely to Tezcuco a convoy on which all the future operations of his countrymen depended.\n\nCortes determined to attack the city from three different quarters; from Tezcuco on the east side of the lake, from Tacuba on the west, and from Cuayocan towards the south. Those towns were situated on the principal causeways which led to the capital, and intended for their defence. He appointed Sandoval to command in the first, Pedro de Alvarado in the second, and Crist\u00f3bal de Olid in the third; allotting to each a numerous body of Indian auxiliaries, together with an equal division of Spaniards, who, by the junction of the troops from Hispaniola, amounted now to 86 horsemen, and 818 foot soldiers; of whom 118 were armed with muskets or cross bows. Their train of artillery consisted of three battering cannon, and 15 field-\npieces. He referred for himself, as the station of greatest importance and danger, the conduct of the brigantines, each armed with one of his small cannon, and manned with 25 Spaniards.\n\nAs Alvarado and Olid proceeded towards the posts assigned them, they broke down the aqueducts which the ingenuity of the Mexicans had erected for conveying water into the capital, and, by the distresses to which this reduced the inhabitants, gave a beginning to the calamities which they were destined to suffer. Alvarado and Olid found the towns, of which they were ordered to take possession, deserted by their inhabitants, who had fled for safety to the capital, where Guatimozin had collected the chief force of his empire, as there alone he could hope to make a successful stand against the formidable enemies who were approaching to assail him.\n\nThe first effort of the Mexicans was to destroy the fleet of brigantines, the fatal effects of whose operations they foresaw and dreaded. Though the brigantines, after all the labour and merit of Cortes in constructing them, were of considerable bulk, rudely constructed, and manned chiefly with landmen, hardly possessed of skill enough to conduct them, they must have been objects of terror to a people unacquainted with any navigation but that of their lake, and possessed of no vessel larger than a canoe. Necessity, however, urged Guatimozin to hazard the attack; and hoping to supply by numbers what he wanted in force, he assembled such a multitude of canoes as covered the face of the lake. They rowed on boldly to the charge, while the brigantines, retarded by a dead calm, could scarcely advance to meet them. But as the enemy drew near, a breeze suddenly sprung up; in a moment the sails were spread, and the brigantines with irresistible impetuosity broke their feeble opponents, overset many canoes, and dissipated the whole armament with such slaughter, as convinced the Mexicans, that the progress of the Europeans in knowledge and arts rendered their superiority greater on this new element than they had hitherto found it by land.\n\nFrom that time Cortes remained master of the lake; and the brigantines not only prevented a communication between the Spaniards in their different stations, though at a considerable distance from each other; but were employed to cover the causeways on each side, and keep off the canoes, when they attempted to annoy the troops as they advanced towards the city. He formed the brigantines in three divisions, allotting one to each station, with orders to second the operations of the officer who commanded there. From all the three stations he pushed on the attack against the city with equal vigour; but in a manner so very different from that by which sieges are conducted in regular war, as might appear no less improper than singular to persons unacquainted with his situation. Each morning his troops assaulted the barricades which the enemy had erected on the causeways, forced their way over the trenches which they had dug, and through the canals where the bridges were broken down, and endeavoured to penetrate into the heart of the city, in hopes of obtaining some decisive advantage, which might force the enemy to surrender, and terminate the war at once; but when the obstinate valour of the Mexicans rendered the efforts of the day ineffectual, the Spaniards retired in the evening to their former quarters. Thus their toil and danger were, in some measure, continually renewed, the Mexicans repairing in the night what the Spaniards had destroyed through the day, and recovering the posts from which they had driven them. But necessity prescribed this slow and untoward mode of operation. The number of his troops was so small, that Cortes durst not, with a handful of men, attempt to make a lodgement in a city where he might be surrounded and annoyed by such a multitude of enemies. The remembrance of what he had already suffered by the ill-judged confidence with which he had ventured into such a dangerous situation, was still fresh in his mind. The Spaniards, exhausted with fatigue, were unable to guard the various posts which they daily gained; and though their camp was filled with Indian auxiliaries, they durst not devolve this charge upon them, because they were so little accustomed to discipline, that no confidence could be placed in their vigilance. Besides this, Cortes was extremely solicitous to preserve the city as much as possible from being destroyed, both as he deemed it to be the capital of his conquests, and wished that it might remain as a monument of his glory. From all these considerations, he adhered obstinately, for a month after the siege was opened, to the system which he had adopted. The Mexicans, in their own defence, displayed valour which was hardly inferior to that with which the Spaniards attacked them. On land, on water, by night and by day, one furious conflict succeeded to another. Several Spaniards were killed, more wounded, and all were ready to sink under the toils of uninterrupted service, which were rendered more intolerable by the injuries of the season, the periodical rains being now set in with their usual violence.\n\nAstonished and disconcerted with the length and difficulties of the siege, Cortes determined to make one great effort to get possession of the city before he relinquished the plan which he had hitherto followed, and had recourse to any other mode of attack. With this view he sent instructions to Alvarado and Sandoval to advance with their divisions to a general assault, and took the command in person of that posted on the causeway of Cuyocan. Animated by his presence, and the expectation of some decisive event, the Spaniards pushed forward with irresistible impetuosity. They broke through one barricade after another, forced their way over the ditches and canals, and having entered the city, gained ground incessantly, in spite of the multitude and ferocity of their opponents. Cortes, though delighted with the rapidity of his progress, did not forget that he might still find it necessary to retreat; and in order to secure it, appointed Julian de Alderete, a captain of chief note in the troops which he had received from Hispaniola, to fill up the canals and gaps in the causeway as the main body advanced. That officer deeming it inglorious to be thus employed, while his companions were in the heat of action and the career of victory, neglected the important charge committed to him, and hurried on inconsiderately to mingle with the combatants. The Mexicans, whose military attention and skill were daily improving, no sooner observed this, than they carried an account of it to their monarch.\n\nGuatimozin instantly discerned the consequences of\nthe error which the Spaniards had committed, and, with admirable presence of mind, prepared to take advantage of it. He commanded the troops posted in the front to slacken their efforts, in order to allure the Spaniards to push forward, while he despatched a large body of chosen warriors through different streets, some by land, and others by water, towards the great breach in the causeway, which had been left open. On a signal which he gave, the priests in the great temple struck the great drum consecrated to the god of war. No sooner did the Mexicans near its doleful solemn sound, calculated to inspire them with contempt of death and with enthusiastic ardour, than they rushed upon the enemy with frantic rage. The Spaniards, unable to resist men urged on by religious fury than hope of success, began to retire, at first leisurely, and with a good countenance; but as the enemy pressed on, and their own impatience to escape increased, the terror and confusion became so general, that when they arrived at the gap in the causeway, Spaniards and Tlascalans, horsemen and infantry, plunged in promiscuously, while the Mexicans rushed upon them fiercely from every side, their light canoes carrying them through shoals which the brigantines could not approach. In vain did Cortes attempt to stop and rally his flying troops; fear rendered them regardless of his entreaties or commands. Finding all his endeavours to renew the combat fruitless, his next care was to save some of those who had thrown themselves into the water; but while thus employed, with more attention to their situation than to his own, six Mexican captains suddenly laid hold of him, and were hurrying him off in triumph; and though two of his officers rescued him at the expense of their own lives, he received several dangerous wounds before he could break loose. Above sixty Spaniards perished in the rout; and what rendered the disaster more afflicting, forty of these fell alive into the hands of an enemy never known to show mercy to a captive.\n\nThe approach of night, though it delivered the defeated Spaniards from the attacks of the enemy, ushered in, what was hardly less grievous, the noise of their barbarous triumph, and of the horrid festival with which they celebrated their victory. Every quarter of the city was illuminated; the great temple shone with such peculiar splendour, that the Spaniards could plainly see the people in motion, and the priests busy in hastening the preparations for the death of the prisoners. Through the gloom they fancied that they discerned their companions by the whiteness of their skins, as they were stripped naked and compelled to dance before the image of the god to whom they were to be offered. They heard the shrieks of those who were sacrificed, and thought they could distinguish each unhappy victim by the well-known sound of his voice. Imagination added to what they really saw or heard, and augmented its horror. The most unfeeling melted into tears of compassion, and the stoutest heart trembled at the dreadful spectacle which they beheld.\n\nCortes, who, besides all that he felt in common with his soldiers, was oppressed with the additional load of anxious reflections natural to a general on such an unexpected calamity, could not like them relieve his mind by giving vent to its anguish. He was obliged to assume an air of tranquillity in order to revive the spirits and hopes of his followers. The juncture, indeed, required an extraordinary exertion of fortitude. The Mexicans, elated with their victory, sallied out next morning to attack him in his quarters. But they did not rely on the efforts of their own arms alone: they sent the heads of the Spaniards whom they had sacrificed to the leading men in the adjacent provinces, and assured them that the god of war, appealed by the blood of their invaders, which had been shed so plentifully on his altars, had declared with an audible voice, that in eight days time those hated enemies should be finally destroyed, and peace and prosperity re-established in the empire.\n\nA prediction, uttered with such confidence, and in terms so void of ambiguity, gained universal credit among a people prone to superstition. The zeal of the provinces which had already declared against the Spaniards augmented, and several which had hitherto remained inactive took arms with enthusiastic ardour to execute the decrees of the gods. The Indian auxiliaries who had joined Cortes, accustomed to venerate the same deities with the Mexicans, and to receive the responses of their priests with the same implicit faith, abandoned the Spaniards as a race of men devoted to certain destruction. Even the fidelity of the Tlascalans was shaken, and the Spanish troops were left almost alone in their stations. Cortes, finding that he attempted in vain to dispel the superstitious fears of his confederates by argument, took advantage, from the imprudence of those who had framed the prophecy in fixing its accomplishment so near at hand, to give them a striking demonstration of its falsity. He suspended all military operations during the period marked out by the oracle. Under cover of the brigantines, which kept the enemy at a distance, his troops lay in safety, and the fatal term expired without any disaster.\n\nHis allies, ashamed of their own credulity, returned to their station. Other tribes, judging that the gods, who had now deceived the Mexicans, had decreed finally to withdraw their protection from them, joined his standard; and such was the levity of a simple people, moved by every flight impression, that, in a short time after such a general defection of his confederates, Cortes saw himself, if we may believe his own account, at the head of fifteen thousand Indians. Even with such a numerous army, he found it necessary to adopt a new and more wary system of operation. Instead of renewing his attempts to become master of the city at once, by such bold but dangerous efforts of valor as he had already tried, he made his advances gradually, and with every possible precaution against exposing his men to any calamity similar to that which they still bewailed. As the Spaniards pushed forward, the Indians regularly repaired the causeways behind them. As soon as they got possession of any part of the town, the houses were instantly levelled with the ground. Day by day, the Mexicans, forced to retire as their enemies gained ground, were hemmed in within more narrow limits. Guatimozin, though unable to stop the career of the enemy, continued to defend his capital with obstinate resolution, and disputed every inch of ground. But the Spaniards, having not only varied their mode of attack, but, by order of Cortes, having changed the weapons\nMexico, with which they fought, were again armed with the long Chinantlan spears, which they had employed with such success against Narvaez; and, by the firm array in which this enabled them to range themselves, they repelled, with little danger, the looie assault of the Mexicans; incredible numbers of whom fell in the conflicts, which they renewed every day. While war waited without, famine began to consume them within the city. The Spanish brigantines, having the entire command of the lake, rendered it impossible to receive any supply of provisions by water. The vast number of his Indian auxiliaries enabled Cortes to shut up the avenues to the city by land. The stores which Guatimozin had laid up were exhausted by the multitudes which crowded into the capital to defend their sovereign and the temples of their gods. Not only the people, but persons of the highest rank, felt the utmost distresses of want. What they suffered brought on infectious and mortal distempers, the last calamity that visits beleaguered cities, and which filled up the measure of their woes.\n\nBut, under the pressure of so many and such various evils, the spirit of Guatimozin remained firm and unshaken. He rejected with scorn every overture of peace from Cortes; and, disdaining the idea of submitting to the oppressors of his country, determined not to survive its ruin. The Spaniards continued their progress. At length all the three divisions penetrated into the great square in the centre of the city, and made a secure lodgment there. Three-fourths of the city were now reduced, and laid in ruins. The remaining quarter was so closely pressed, that it could not long withstand assailants who attacked it from their new station with superior advantage, and more assured expectation of success. The Mexican nobles, solicitous to save the life of a monarch whom they revered, prevailed on Guatimozin to retire from a place where resistance was now vain, that he might rouse the more distant provinces of the empire to arms, and maintain there a more successful struggle with the public enemy. In order to facilitate the execution of this measure, they endeavoured to amuse Cortes with overtures of submission, that, while his attention was employed in adjusting the articles of pacification, Guatimozin might escape unperceived. But they made this attempt upon a leader of greater sagacity and discernment than to be deceived by their arts. Cortes suspecting their intention, and aware of what moment it was to defeat it, appointed Sandoval, the officer on whose vigilance he could most perfectly rely, to take the command of the brigantines, with strict injunctions to watch every motion of the enemy. Sandoval, attentive to the charge, observing some large canoes crowded with people rowing along the lake with extraordinary rapidity, instantly gave the signal to chase. Gracia Holguin, who commanded the fleetest brigantine, soon overtook them, and was preparing to fire on the foremost canoe, which seemed to carry some person whom all the rest followed and obeyed. At once the rowers dropt their oars, and all on board, throwing down their arms, conjured him with cries and tears to forbear, as the emperor was there. Holguin eagerly seized his prize; and Guatimozin, with a dignified composure, gave himself up into his hands, praying only that no insult might be offered to the empress or his children. When conducted to Cortes, he appeared neither with the fullen fierceness of a barbarian, nor with the dejection of a supplicant. \"I have done,\" said he, addressing himself to the Spanish general, \"what became a monarch. I have defended my people to the last extremity. Nothing now remains but to die. Take this dagger,\" laying his hand on one which Cortes wore, \"plant it in my breast, and put an end to a life which can no longer be of use.\"\n\nAs soon as the fate of their sovereign was known, Mexico, the resistance of the Mexicans ceased; and Cortes took possession of that small part of the capital which yet remained undestroyed. Thus terminated the siege of Mexico, the most memorable event in the conquest of America. It continued 75 days, hardly one of which passed without some extraordinary effort of one party in the attack, or of the other in the defence of a city, on the fate of which both knew that the fortune of the empire depended. As the struggle here was more obstinate, it was likewise more equal, than any between the inhabitants of the Old and New Worlds. The great abilities of Guatimozin, the number of his troops, the peculiar situation of his capital, so far counterbalanced the superiority of the Spaniards in arms and discipline, that they must have relinquished the enterprise, if they had trusted to success to themselves alone. But Mexico was overturned by the jealousy of neighbours who dreaded its power, and by the revolt of subjects impatient to shake off its yoke. By their effectual aid, Cortes was enabled to accomplish what, without such support, he would hardly have ventured to attempt. How muchsoever this account of the reduction of Mexico may detract, on the one hand, from the marvellous relations of some Spanish writers, by ascribing that to simple and obvious causes which they attribute to the romantic valour of their countrymen, it adds, on the other, to the merit and abilities of Cortes, who, under every disadvantage, acquired such an ascendant over unknown nations, as to render them instruments towards carrying his scheme into execution.\n\nThe exultation of the Spaniards, on accomplishing this arduous enterprise, was at first excessive. But this was quickly damped by the cruel disappointment of those sanguine hopes which had animated them amidst so many hardships and dangers. Instead of the inexhaustible wealth which they expected from becoming masters of Montezuma's treasures, and the ornaments of so many temples, their rapaciousness could collect only an inconsiderable booty amidst ruins and desolation (A). Guatimozin, aware of his impending fate, had ordered what remained of the riches amassed by his ancestors to be thrown into the lake. The Indian auxiliaries, while the Spaniards were engaged in conflict,\n\n(a) The gold and silver according to Cortes, amounted only to 120,000 pesos, (Relat. 280, A.) a sum far inferior to that which the Spaniards had formerly divided in Mexico.\nMexico, fleet with the enemy, had carried off the most valuable part of the spoil. The sum to be divided among the conquerors was so small, that many of them disdained to accept of the pittance which fell to their share, and all murmured and exclaimed; some against Cortes and his confidants, whom they suspected of having fe-cretly appropriated to their own use a large portion of the riches which should have been brought into the com- mon stock; others against Guatimozin, whom they ac-cused of obstinacy, in refusing to discover the place where he had hidden his treasure.\n\nArguments, entreaties, and promises, were employed in order to soothe them; but with so little effect, that Cortes, from solicitude to check this growing spirit of discontent, gave way to a deed which stained the glory of all his great actions. Without regarding the former dignity of Guatimozin, or feeling any re-verence for those virtues which he had displayed, he subjected the unhappy monarch, together with his chief favourite, to torture, in order to force from them a discovery of the royal treasures, which it was sup-posed they had concealed. Guatimozin bore whatever the refined cruelty of his tormentors could inflict, with the invincible fortitude of an American warrior. His fellow-sufferer, overcome by the violence of the anguish, turned a dejected eye towards his master, which seemed to implore his permission to reveal all that he knew. But the high-spirited prince, darting on him a look of authority mingled with scorn, check-ed his weakness, by asking, \"Am I now reposing on a bed of flowers?\" Overawed by the reproach, he per-veered in his dutiful silence, and expired. Cortes, ashamed of a scene so horrid, refused the royal victim from the hands of his torturers, and prolonged a life referred for new indignities and sufferings.\n\nThe fate of the capital, as both parties had fore-seen, decided that of the empire. The provinces sub-mitted one after another to the conquerors. Small detachments of Spaniards marching through them without interruption, penetrated, in different quarters, to the great Southern ocean, which, according to the ideas of Columbus, they imagined would open a short as well as easy passage to the East Indies, and secure to the crown of Castile all the envied wealth of those fertile regions; and the active mind of Cortes began already to form schemes for attempting this important discovery. In his after-schemes, however, he was dis-appointed; but Mexico hath ever since remained in the hands of the Spaniards.\n\nThe ancient kingdom of Mexico, properly so called, was divided into several provinces, of which the vale of Mexico itself was the finest in every respect. It is surrounded by verdant mountains, measuring upwards of 120 miles in circumference at their base. A great part of this vale is occupied by two lakes, the upper one of fresh water, but the lower one brackish, com-municating with the former by means of a canal. All the water running from the mountains is collected in this lower lake, on account of its being in the bottom of the valley; hence it was ready, when swelled by extraordinary rains, to overflow the city of Mexico, as has been already observed. This delightful region contained the three imperial cities of Mexico, Aco-lhuacan, and Tlacopan; besides 40 others, with innu-merable villages and hamlets; but the most consider-able of these, according to Clavigero, now scarcely retain one-twentieth part of their former magnificence. The principal inland provinces to the northward were the Otomies; to the south-west the Malatzincas and Cuitlatecas; to the south the Tlahuicas and Cohu-iexas; to the south-east, after the states of Itzocan, Jauhtepac, Quauhquecollon, Atlxco, Tehuacan, and others, were the great provinces of the Mixtecas, the Zapotecas, and the Chiapanecas; towards the east were the provinces of Tepayacac, the Popolocas, and Totonacas. The maritime provinces on the Mexican gulf were Coatzacualco and Cuatlachtlan, called by the Spaniards Cotulla. On the Pacific ocean were those of Coliman, Zacatollan, Tototepec, Tecuantepetl, and Zoconochco.\n\nThe province of the Otomies began in the northern part of the vale of Mexico, extending through the mountains to the north to the distance of 90 miles from the city of Mexico; the principal cities being Tollan or Tula, and Xilotepec; the latter made the capital of the country by the Spaniards. Beyond the settlements of the Otomies, the country for more than a thousand miles in extent was inhabited only by barbarous and wandering savages.\n\nThe Malatzincas province contained the valley of Tolocan, and all the country from Taximaroa to the frontier of the kingdom of Michuacan. The valley of Tolocan is upwards of 40 miles long from south-east to north-west, and 30 in breadth where broadest. Its principal city, named also Tolocan, is situated at the foot of a high mountain covered with snow, 30 miles distant from Mexico.\n\nThe country of the Cuitlatecas extended from north-east to south-west, upwards of 200 miles, extending as far as the Pacific ocean. Their capital was named Mexcaltepec, once a great and populous city, situated upon the sea-coast; but of which the ruins are now scarcely visible. That of the Tlahuicas was named Quauhnahuac, and situated about 40 miles to the south-ward of Mexico. The province extended almost 60 miles southward, commencing from the southern moun-tains of the vale of Mexico.\n\nThe country of the Cohuixcas extended on the southward as far as the Pacific ocean, through that part where at present the port and city of Acapulco lie. It was divided into the states of Tzompango, Chilapan, Tlapan, and Tititla; the latter a very hot and unwholesome country. To this province belonged a place named Tlacheo, celebrated for its silver mines.\n\nThe province of the Mixtecas extended from Acat-lan, a place distant about 120 miles from Mexico, as far as the Pacific ocean towards the south-east. The inhabitants carried on a considerable commerce, and had several well-inhabited cities and villages. To the east of the Mixtecas were the Zapotecas, so called from their capital Teetzapotlan. In their district was the valley of Huaxyacac, now Oaxaca or Guaxaca.\n\nThe province of Mazatlan lay to the northward of the Mixtecas; and to the northward and eastward of the Zapotecas was Glimantla, having their capitals of the same name with their provinces. The Chiapanecas, Zoqui, and Queleni, were the last of the Mexican provinces towards the south-east. On the side of the mountain Popocatepec and around it lay several states,\nof which the most considerable were Cholallan and Huexotzinco. These two having, with the assistance of the Tlascalans, shaken off the Mexican yoke, re-established their former aristocratical government. The Cholulans possessed a small hamlet called Cuitlaxcoapan, in the place where the Spaniards afterwards founded the city of Angelopolis, which is the second of New Spain.\n\nTo the eastward of Cholula lay a considerable state named Tepeyacac; and beyond that the Popolocas, whose principal cities were Tecamachalco and Quetzolac. To the southward of the Popolocas was the state of Tahuacan, bordering upon the country of the Mixtecas; to the east, the maritime province of Cuetlachtlan; and to the north the Totonacas. The extent of this province was 150 miles, beginning from the frontier of Zacatlan, a state distant about 80 miles from the coast, and terminating in the gulf of Mexico. Besides the capital, named Mizquihuacan, this country had the beautiful city of Chempoallan, situated on the coast of the gulf; remarkable for being that by which the Spaniards entered the Mexican empire.\n\nColima was the most northerly of the provinces on the Pacific ocean; the capital, named also Coliman, being in lat. 19\u00b0 long. 92\u00b0 W. Towards the south-east was the province of Zacotlan, with its capital of the same name; then came the coast of the Cuitlatecas; after it that of the Cohuixcanes, in which was the celebrated port of Acapulco. The Yopil bordered on the Cohuixca coast; and adjoining to that the Mixteca country, now called Xicayan; next to that was the large province of Tecuatepec; and lastly, that of Xococonochco.\n\nThis province, the most southerly of the Mexican empire, was bounded on the east and south-east by the country of Xochitepec, which did not belong to Mexico; on the west by Tecuatepec; and on the south by the ocean. The capital, called also Xococonochco, was situated between two rivers, in 14 degrees of latitude and 103\u00b0 W. longitude. On the Mexican gulf there were, besides the country of the Totonecas, the provinces of Cuetlachtlan and Coatzacualco; the latter bounded on the east by the states of Tabasco and the peninsula of Yucatan. The province of Cuetlachtlan comprehended all the coast between the rivers Alvarado and Antigua, where the province of the Totonecas began.\n\nThe climate of this vast country varies very much according to the situation of its different parts. The maritime places are hot, unhealthy, and moist. The lands which lie in the neighbourhood of high mountains, the tops of which are always covered with snow, must of necessity be cold; and Clavigero informs us, that he has been on a mountain not more than 25 miles distant from the city of Mexico, where there was white frost and ice even in the dog-days.\n\n\"All the other inland countries (says our author), where the greatest population prevailed, enjoy a climate so mild and benign, that they neither feel the rigour of winter nor the heats of summer. It is true, in many of these countries, there is frequently white frost in the three months of December, January, and February, and sometimes even it snows; but the small inconvenience which such cold occasions continues only till the rising sun: no other fire than his rays is necessary to give warmth in winter; no other relief is wanted in the season of heat but the shade: the same clothing which covers men in the dog-days defends them in January, and the animals sleep all the year under the open sky.\"\n\n\"This mildness and agreeableness of climate under the influence of the torrid zone is the effect of several natural causes entirely unknown to the ancients, who did not believe it to be inhabited; and not well understood by some moderns, by whom it is believed unfavourable to those who live in it. The purity of the atmosphere, the smaller obliquity of the solar rays, and the longer stay of this luminary above the horizon in winter, in comparison of other regions farther removed from the equator, concur to lessen the cold, and to prevent all that horror which disfigures the face of nature in other climes. During that season a serene sky and the natural delights of the country are enjoyed; whereas, under the frigid, and even for the most part under the temperate zones, the clouds rob man of the prospect of heaven, and the snow buries the beautiful productions of the earth. No less causes combine to temper the heat of summer. The plentiful showers which frequently water the earth after mid-day from April or May to September or October; the high mountains, continually loaded with snow, scattered here and there through the country of Anahuac; the cool winds which breathe from them in that season; and the shorter stay of the sun above the horizon, compared with the circumstances of the temperate zone, transform the climates of those happy countries into a cool and cheerful spring. But the agreeableness of the climate is counterbalanced by thunder storms, which are frequent in summer, particularly in the neighbourhood of the mountain of Tlascala; and by earthquakes, which are at all times felt, though with less danger than terror. Storms of hail are neither more frequent nor more severe than in Europe.\"\n\nOne undoubted inconvenience which Mexico has is that of volcanoes. One named by the Spaniards Vulcan, can d'Orizaba is higher than the peak of Teneriffe, according to the Jesuit Tallandier, who measured them both. It began to send forth smoke in the year 1545, and continued burning for 20 years, but has not discovered any symptoms of eruption since that time. It is of a conical figure; and may be seen at 50 leagues distance. The top is always covered with snow, but the lower part with woods of pine and other valuable timber. It is about 90 miles to the eastward of the capital.\n\nTwo other mountains, named Popocatepec and Ixtaccihuatl, which lie near each other, at the distance of 33 miles to the south-east of Mexico, are likewise surprisingly high. Clavigero supposes the former to be higher than the highest of the Alps, considering the elevated ground on which the base of it stands. It has a crater more than half a mile wide; from which, in the time of the Mexican kings, great quantities of smoke and flame issued. In the 17th century it frequently threw out great showers of ashes upon the adjacent places; but in the 18th century hardly any smoke has been observed. This mountain is named by the Spaniards Vulcan, and the other Sierra Nevada. The latter has also sometimes emitted flames.\nMexico. Both of them have their tops always covered with snow in such quantities, that the masses which fall down upon the neighbouring rocks supply the cities of Mexico, Gelopoli, Cholula, and all the adjacent country to the distance of 40 miles, with that commodity; of which the consumption is so great, that in 1746 the impost upon what was consumed in the city of Mexico amounted to 15,222 Mexican crowns; some years after it amounted to 20,000; and is now in all probability a great deal more.\n\nBesides these volcanoes, there are others in Mexico of a very remarkable height. The great chain of mountains called the Andes is continued through the isthmus of Panama and through all Mexico, until they are lost in the unknown mountains of the north. The most considerable of that chain is known in Mexico by the name of Sierra Madre, particularly in Cincoa and Tarahumara, provinces no less than 1200 miles distant from the capital.\n\nMexico is well watered by very considerable rivers, though none of them are comparable to those of South America. Some of these run into the gulf of Mexico, and others into the Pacific ocean. The Alvarado has its principal source among the mountains of the Zapotecas, and discharges itself by three navigable mouths into the Mexican gulf, at the distance of 30 miles from Vera Cruz. The most celebrated of the rivers which run into the Pacific ocean is that called by the Spaniards Guadalaxara or Great River. It rises in the mountains of Tolocan; and after running a course of more than 600 miles, discharges itself into the ocean in 22\u00b0 latitude.\n\nThere are likewise in this country several lakes of very considerable magnitude; but those of Nicaragua, Chapallan, and Pazquaro, which are of the greatest extent, did not belong to the ancient Mexican empire. The most remarkable were those in the vale of Mexico, upon which the capital of the empire was founded. Of these, the fresh water one, called the lake of Chalco, extended in length from east to west 12 miles, as far as the city of Xochimilco; from thence, taking a northerly direction, it incorporated itself by means of a canal with the lake of Tezcuco; but its breadth did not exceed six miles. The other, named the lake of Texcoco, extended 15, or rather 17 miles from east to west, and something more from south to north; but its extent is now much less, by reason of the Spaniards having diverted the course of many of the streams which run into it. This lake is salt, which Clavigero supposes to arise from the nature of the soil which forms its bed.\n\nBesides these, there are a number of smaller lakes, some of which are very delightful. There is a vast variety of mineral waters, of the nitrous, sulphureous, and aluminous kinds, some of them so hot that meat may be boiled in them. At Tetihuacan is a kind of petrifying water, as well as in several other parts of the empire. One of them forms a kind of smooth white stones, not displeasing to the taste; the scrapings of which taken in broth are celebrated as a diaphoretic, probably without any good reason. The dose for a person not difficult to be sweated is one dram of the scrapings. Many of the rivers of Mexico afford surprising and beautiful cascades; particularly the great river Guadalaxara, at a place called Tempizque, 15 miles to the southward of that city. Along a deep river called Atoyaque is a natural bridge, consisting of a vast mound of earth, along which carriages pass conveniently. Clavigero supposes it to have been the fragment of a mountain thrown down by an earthquake, and then penetrated by the river.\n\nThe mineral productions of Mexico are extremely valuable, such as gold and silver in abundance, two productions species of copper, tin, lead, mercury, sulphur, alum, vitriol, amber, and asphaltum. It also produces diamonds, amethysts, cats-eyes, cornelians, and some green stones resembling emeralds, as also quarries of jasper and marble of various colours. There are said to be whole mountains of loadstone, and a fine white talc which may be burnt into an excellent plaster.\n\nThe soil is capable of producing all the necessaries, and even the luxuries of human life. Historians mention no fewer than 1200 plants which are all indigenous, or natives of the country; but as these are said to be chiefly medicinal, we must conclude that provident nature has furnished them with many more which are intended for nourishment.\n\nThis country abounds with a great variety of flowers, numbers of which are peculiar to itself, while many exotics even rival them in luxuriance, such as imported from Europe. Water-melons, apples, pears, peaches, apricots, figs, &c., are among the exotics, which thrive in a manner equal to any of the indigenous productions. All the maritime countries abound with cocoa-nut trees, of which Hernandez mentions four kinds, the smallest of which is mostly used for chocolate and other drinks.\n\nPrior to the introduction of corn from Europe, maize was the principal grain of Mexico, and of which there were several species. It was brought from America to Spain, and from thence to the other countries of Europe. The principal kind of pulse used by the people was the French bean, the different species of which exceeded in number those of the maize; and one of them in particular not only supported the poorer classes, but even the Spanish nobility deemed it a luxury. Historians enumerate five species of esculent roots, exclusive of many culinary vegetables imported from the Canaries, Spain, and other European countries. This country produces a variety of palm trees, from the fibres of the leaves of one species of which the Mexicans manufacture thread. The timber trees are numerous, and, in respect of quality, said to be inferior to none in the world. There are whole woods of cedars and ebonies, and some trees mentioned by Clavigero are of a most stupendous magnitude. This author mentions one that measured 107 Paris feet in height; and Acosta speaks of one that was 16 fathoms in circumference. A remarkable fir tree hollowed by lightning, contained within it 100 young men, according to the testimony of the archbishop of Toledo, who went to view it in the year 1770.\n\nThis country abounds also with aromatic and medicinal trees, producing gums, resins, &c. From one and another of these a balsam is produced not in the least inferior to the celebrated balsam of Mecca. It is of a reddish black or yellowish white, of a sharp bitter taste, and of a strong but most grateful odour. It is common in the provinces of Panuco and Chiapan, and other warm countries.\nThe tree producing liquid amber, the liquid florax of the Mexicans, is of a large size, the leaves similar to those of the maple, indented, white in one part and dark in the other, disposed in three; the fruit is thorny and round, but polygonous, with the surface and the angles yellow; the bark of the tree partly green and partly tawny. By incisions in the trunk they extract that valuable substance named liquid amber, and the oil of the same name, which is still more valuable. Liquid amber is likewise obtained from a decoction of the branches, but it is inferior to that obtained from the trunk.\n\nThe name copalli in Mexico is generic, and common to all the resins; but especially signifies those made use of for incense. There are ten species of these trees yielding resins of this kind; the principal of which is that from which the coral is got, so well known in medicine and varnishes. A great quantity of this was made use of by the ancient Mexicans, and is still used for similar purposes by the Spaniards. The teocalli or tepocalli is a resin similar to the incense of Arabia; which distils from a tree of moderate size that grows in the mountains, having a fruit like an acorn, and containing the nut enveloped in a mucilage, within which there is a small kernel useful in medicine.\n\nThe mezquite, or mezquite, is a species of true acacia, and the gum distilling from it is said to be the true gum arabic. It is a thorny shrub, with branches irregularly disposed, the leaves small, thin, and pinnate; the flowers being like those of the birch-tree. Of the elastic gum, which is found in plenty in Mexico, the natives were in use to make foot-balls, which, though heavy, have a better spring than those filled with air. With this they varnish their hats, cloaks, boots, and great coats, in a manner similar to what is done in Europe with wax; and by which means they are rendered all water proof.\n\nThe quadrupeds found in Mexico at the arrival of the Spaniards, were lions, tygers, wild cats, bears, wolves, foxes, the common flags, white flags, bucks, wild goats, badgers, polecats, weasels, martins, squirrels, polatucos, rabbits, hares, otters, and rats. All these animals are supposed to be common to both continents. The white flag, whether it be the same species of the other or not, is undoubtedly common to both, and was known to the Greeks and Romans. The Mexicans call it the king of the flags. M. Buffon imagines the white colour of this creature to be the effect of captivity; but Clavigero says, that it is found wild, and of the same white colour, on the mountains of New Spain. In many other points, he also contests the opinions of this celebrated naturalist, who will not allow the lion, tyger, or rabbit, to be natives of America.\n\nClavigero enumerates the quadrupeds common to New Spain with the rest of the continent of America. Among these he will not allow a place to the Peruvian sheep, the llanaco, and sloth; all of which are peculiar to South America. Hernandez indeed makes mention of the Peruvian sheep, and gives a drawing of it; but this was only on account of a few individuals brought thence from Peru, which the Mexicans called by that name, in the same manner as he describes several animals of the Philippine isles; not that they had ever been bred in Mexico, or found in any country of North America, unless it was some individual carried there, as they are carried as a curiosity from Europe. The animals which he allows to be common to both countries are, the Mexican hog, the mousette, the opossum, the armadillo, the teochichi, a small animal resembling a dog; which being perfectly dumb, gave occasion to a report that the Mexican dogs could not bark. The flesh of this animal was eaten by them, and was esteemed agreeable and nourishing food. After the conquest of Mexico, the Spaniards having neither large cattle nor sheep, provided their markets with this quadruped; by which means, the species soon came to be extinct, though it had been very numerous. The land-squirrel is very numerous in the kingdom of Michuacan, has great elegance of form, and is extremely graceful in its movements; but it cannot be tamed, and bites most furiously every person who approaches it.\n\nBesides these, there are sea lions, rats, and that voracious animal named the tapir. Oviedo informs us, that he has seen it at one bite tear off two or three hand-breadths of skin from a hound, and at another a whole leg and thigh. The flesh is eatable, and its skin is valued on account of its being sufficiently strong to resist musket-balls. There are likewise great numbers of monkeys of many different kinds; some of which have heads resembling those of dogs. Some of them are strong and fierce, equalling a man in stature when they stand upright.\n\nAmong the animals peculiar to Mexico, is one named coyote, which appears to have been inaccurately described by natural historians; some making it one species and some another. It is about the size of a maitiff, but more slender. The eyes are yellow and sparkling, ears small, pointed, and erect; the snout blackish, strong limbs, and the feet armed with large crooked nails. The tail is thick and hairy, the skin a mixture of black, brown, and white; and the voice is compounded of the howl of the wolf and the bark of the dog. It pursues the deer, and will sometimes even attack men. Its usual pace is a trot, but so quick that a horse at the gallop can scarcely overtake it. The talcojol or talcoyoto is about the size of a middling dog, and the largest animal that lives under the earth. Its head has some resemblance to that of a cat; but in colour and length of hair it resembles the lion.\u2014It has a long thick tail, and feeds upon poultry and small animals, which it catches in the night-time. The tepexuintli, or mountain-dog, though it is but of the size of a small dog, is so bold that it attacks deer, and sometimes kills them. Its hair and tail are long, the body black, but the head, neck, and breast, white. M. Buffon reckons this animal, the same with the glutton, but Clavigero denies it. Another animal, larger than the two foregoing, is called the xoloitzcuintli. Some of these are no less than four feet in length. It has a face like the dog, but tufts like the wolf, with erect ears, the neck grofs, and the tail long.\u2014It is entirely destitute of hair, excepting only the snout, where there are some thick crooked bristles. The whole body is covered with a smooth, soft, alabaster-coloured skin, spotted partly with black and tawny. These species of animals, as well as the two former, are almost totally extinct. A Lyncean academician named\nThere are great numbers of birds valuable on account of their plumage, which was made use of by the Mexicans in their excellent mosaic works; an art which seems now to be totally lost. Peacocks have been carried from the old continent to Mexico; but, not being attended to, have propagated very slowly. The birds remarkable for their song are likewise very numerous; among which that called the centonil, by Europeans the mocking-bird, is the most remarkable, on account of its counterfeiting naturally the notes of all others it hears. There are great numbers of beautiful parrots; and there is a bird which counterfeits the human voice, but in a kind of burlesque tone, and will follow travellers a great way. The izacua is remarkable for its instinct. Birds of this kind live in society, every tree being a village or city to them, having great numbers of nests in the neighbourhood of each other, all hanging from the boughs. One of them, whose office it is to be the head or guard of the village, resides in the middle of the tree; from which it flies about from one nest to another, visiting them all, and after singing a little, returns to its place, while the rest continue perfectly silent. If any bird of a different species approaches the tree, he flies to it, and with his bill and wings endeavours to drive it off; but if a man or any large animal comes near, he flies screaming to another tree; and if at that time any of his fellows happen to be returning to their nests, he meets them, and, changing his note, obliges them to retire again; as soon as he perceives the danger over, he returns to his wonted round of visiting the nests.\n\nMexico, like all other American countries, abounds with reptiles, many of them of enormous size. The crocodiles are not least to be dreaded than those of Africa or Asia, and there are likewise some of those monstrous serpents met with in the East Indies and in South America; though happily the species of those terrible creatures seems to be nearly extinct, as they are seldom to be found but in some solitary wood, or other remote place. There are great numbers of lizards, some of which the people suppose to be poisonous; but Clavigero thinks this opinion ill founded. There are several kinds of poisonous serpents, of which the rattlesnake is one.\n\nThe aquatic animals are innumerable. Clavigero mentions a species of frogs so large that a single one animals will weigh a pound, and which are excellent food. Of fish proper for food, he says that he has counted upwards of 100 species, without taking in the turtle, crab, lobster, or any other crustaceous animal. The sharks are well known for their voracity. A whole sheep's skin, and even a large butcher's knife, has been found in the belly of one of them. They are accustomed to follow vessels, to devour any filth that is thrown overboard; and, according to Oviedo, they have been known to keep up with ships sailing before a fair wind for no less than 500 miles. The bottetto is a fish about eight inches in length, but excessively thick. While this fish lies alive upon the beach, it twells whenever it is touched to an enormous size, and boys often take pleasure in making it burst with a kick. The liver is so poisonous as to kill with strong convulsions in half an hour after it is eaten.\n\nOf flying and other minute insects, the number is prodigiously great. There are a variety of beetles;\nMexico some of a green colour make a great noise in flying; on which account children are fond of them. There are great numbers of shining beetles, which make a delightful appearance at night, as well as the luminous flies which abound in the country. There are six kinds of bees and four kinds of wasps; of which last, one collects wax and honey of a very sweet taste; another is called the wandering wasp from its frequent change of abode; and in consequence of these changes, it is constantly employed in collecting materials for its habitations. The lake of Mexico abounds with a kind of fly, the eggs of which are deposited upon the flags and rushes in such quantities as to form large masses. These are collected by the fishermen, and carried to market for sale. They are eaten by both Mexicans and Spaniards, and have much the same taste as the caviare of fish. There are abundance of gnats in the moist places and lakes; but the capital, though situated upon a lake, is entirely free from them. The butterflies are in vast numbers, and their wings glow with colours far superior to those of Europe; the figures of some of them are given by Hernandez. But notwithstanding its beauties and advantages, Mexico is subject to the dreadful devastations of locusts, which sometimes occasion the most destructive famines.\n\nThere are some of the worms of Mexico made use of by the inhabitants as food; others are poisonous. There are great numbers of scolopendrae and scorpions, some of the former growing to an immense size. Hernandez says, that he has seen some of them two feet long and two inches thick. The scorpions are very numerous; and in the hot parts of the country their poison is so strong as to kill children, and give terrible pain to adults. Their sting is most dangerous during those hours of the day in which the sun is hottest. There is a mischievous kind of tick, which in the hot countries abounds among the grass. From thence it easily gets upon the clothes, and from them upon the skin. There it fixes with such force, from the particular figure of its feet, that it can scarcely be got off. At first it seems nothing but a small black speck, but in a short time enlarges to such a degree, from the blood which it sucks, that it equals the size of a bean, and then assumes a leaden colour. If it is not speedily removed, a wound is made similar to that which the nigra or chogoe makes.\n\nMexico produces silk-worms; and the manufacture of silk might be carried on to great advantage, were it not prohibited for some political reasons. Besides the common silk, there is another found in the woods, very white, soft, and strong. It grows on the trees in several maritime places, particularly in dry seasons. Unless by poor people, however, this silk is not turned to any use, partly from inattention to their interests, but \"chiefly (says our author) from the obstructions which would be thrown in the way of any one who should attempt a trade of that kind. We know from Cortes's letters to Charles V. that silk used to be sold in the Mexican markets; and some pictures are still preserved, done by the ancient Mexicans upon a paper made of silk.\"\n\nCochineal is one of the most valuable products of Mexico, and great care is taken to rear the insect in different parts; but the best is that which comes from the province of Mixteca. Some have reckoned that more than 2500 bags of cochineal are sent every year from Mixteca to Spain; and the trade in that article carried on by the city of Oaxaca is computed at 200,000 crowns value.\n\nThough Mexico was originally inhabited by a general number of different nations, yet all of them resembled description each other pretty much, not only in character, but in of the inhabitants' external appearance. \"They generally rather exceed (says Clavigero) than fall under the middle size, and are well proportioned in all their limbs. They have good complexions, narrow foreheads, black eyes, clean, firm, white, and regular teeth; thick, black, coarse, glossy hair; thin beards, and generally no hair upon their legs, thighs, and arms, their skin being of an olive colour. There is scarcely a nation nor earth in which there are fewer persons deformed; and it would be more difficult to find a single hump-backed, lame, or squint-eyed man among a thousand Mexicans, than among a hundred of any other nation. The unpleasances of their colour, the thinness of their foreheads, the thinness of their beards, and the coarseness of their hair, are so far compensated by the regularity and fine proportion of their limbs, that they can neither be called very beautiful nor the contrary, but seem to hold a middle place between the extremes. Their appearance neither engages nor disgusts; but among the young women of Mexico, there are many very beautiful and fair, whose beauty is at the same time rendered more winning by the natural sweetness of their manner of speaking, and by the pleasantness and natural modesty of their whole behaviour. They become gray-headed and bald earlier than the Spaniards; and although most of them die of acute diseases, it is not very uncommon among them to attain the age of a hundred. They are now, and ever have been, moderate in eating, but their passion for strong liquors is carried to the greatest excess. Formerly they were kept within bounds by the severity of the laws; but now that these liquors are become so common, and drunkenshess is unpunished, one half of the people seem to have lost their senses; and this, together with the poor manner in which they live, exposed to all the baneful impressions of disease, and destitute of the means of correcting them, is undoubtedly the principal cause of the havoc which is made among them by epidemical disorders.\n\n\"Many persons allow the Mexicans to possess a great talent of imitation, but deny them that of invention; a vulgar error, which is contradicted by the ancient history of that people. Their minds are affected by the same variety of passions with those of other nations, but not to an equal degree. The Mexicans seldom exhibit those transports of anger, or frenzies of love, which are so common in other countries. They are slow in their motions; and show a wonderful tenacity and steadfastness in those works which require time and long-continued attention. They are most patient of injury and hardship; and where they suspect no evil intention, are most grateful for any kindness shown: but some Spaniards, who cannot disflinguish patience from insensibility, nor distrust from ingratitude, say proverbially, that the Indians are alike inflexible.\"\nMexico, insensible to injuries or benefits. That habitual distrust which they entertain of all who are not of their nation, prompts them often to lie and betray; so that good faith certainly has not been respected among them so much as it deserves. They are by nature taciturn, serious, and austere; and show more anxiety to punish crimes than to reward virtues.\n\n\"Generosity and perfect disinterestedness are the principal features of their character. Gold with the Mexicans has not that value which it enjoys elsewhere. They seem to give without reluctance what has cost them the utmost labour to acquire. The neglect of selfish interests, with the dislike which they bear to their rulers, and consequently their aversion to perform the tasks imposed by them, seem to have been the only grounds of that much exaggerated indolence with which the Americans have been charged; and, after all, there is no set of people in that country who labour more, or whose labour is more necessary. The respect paid by the young people to the old, and by children to their parents, seem to be feelings that are born with them. Parents are very fond of their children; but the affection which husbands bear to their wives is certainly less than that which wives bear to their husbands; and it is very common for the men to love their neighbours' wives better than their own.\n\n\"Courage and cowardice seem alternately to affect their minds, that it is often difficult to determine whether the one or the other predominates. They meet dangers with intrepidity, when they proceed from natural causes, but are easily terrified by the stern look of a Spaniard. That stupid indifference about death and eternity, which many authors have thought inherent in the character of every American, is peculiar only to those who are yet so rude and unformed as to have no idea of a future state.\"\n\nThe Toltecas, who first inhabited Mexico, were accounted much more polished than those who came after them, inasmuch that in after ages it was customary to distinguish people of ingenuity and learning by the name of Toltecas. They always lived in society, collected into cities, under the government of kings, and had regular laws. They were more addicted to the arts of peace than of war; and it was to them that the succeeding nations owed themselves indebted for their knowledge of the culture of grain, cotton, pepper, &c. They understood the art of casting gold and silver, and melting them in whatever forms they pleased, acquiring also great reputation from their skill in cutting gems of all kinds; and they were besides well versed in the sciences of astronomy and chronology.\n\nAccording to the ancient histories of these people, they observed, about a hundred years before the Christian era, how far the solar year exceeded the civil one; supplying the defect, as we do, by the addition of a day once in four years. In the year 660, while their monarchy continued in Tula, a celebrated astronomer, named Huematzin, assembled with the king's consent all the wise men of the nation; and with their assistance painted a famous book named Tzomoxtli, or \"divine book,\" in which were represented, in very plain figures, the origin of the Indians, their dispersion after the confusion of tongues at Babel, their journey in Asia, their first settlements in America, the founding of the kingdom of Tula, and their progress till that time: but these, and other accounts of their great knowledge and accuracy, favour too much of exaggeration, or perhaps invention, from both which it is impossible to clear the Spaniards when speaking of American affairs.\n\nThe Chichemecas derived their knowledge of agriculture from the Toltecas, and of consequence the Mexicans also. Being destitute of ploughs or animals of agriculture, sufficient strength to assist them in their labour, they made use of an instrument of hard copper, which they called coatl or coa, but differing in shape either from a spade or mattock. They used copper axes to cut trees, the figure of which was the same with ours; only that they put the axe into the eye of the handle, instead of putting the handle into the eye of the axe as we do. They had several other instruments of agriculture, but the forms of them are not mentioned by historians. They watered their fields by means of the rivers and small torrents which came from the mountains; raising dams to collect them, and forming canals to conduct them properly to the places which required moisture. They used enclosures of stone, as well as hedges for the fields, using for their hedges the aloe plant, which is well calculated for the purpose; and what reparations were necessary they gave in December. They dibbled their maize; a method of sowing more slow indeed than the ordinary one, but which certainly repays the trouble by a vastly larger crop, as well as by having a very considerable quantity of seed. Close to the newly tilled fields they commonly erected a small tower of wood, where a man kept watch, in order to drive away the birds that came to feed upon the grain; a custom still preserved among the Spaniards.\n\nIn the cultivation of their gardens, the Mexicans were extremely skilful and magnificent; planting in them not only kitchen herbs, but fruit trees, medicinal herbs, and flowers, with great taste and regularity. Some of the royal gardens excited the admiration of the Spaniards so much, that Cortes, in a letter to Charles V., informed him that the garden at Huaxtepec was the most extensive, the most beautiful, and most delightful, that had ever been beheld. It was six miles in circumference, and watered by a beautiful river which crossed it; and there were pleasure houses erected at proper distances from one another. It was for many years preserved by the Spaniards. The plants most cultivated, next to maize, were cotton, cocoa, and aloe; which last served a great many useful purposes. See ALOE.\n\nThough they had not the advantage of the larger quadrupeds, as horses, oxen, or sheep, they bred up mules, an immense number of quadrupeds unknown in Europe. Private persons brought up the small quadrupeds already mentioned, resembling little dogs; as well as turkeys, quails, geese, ducks, and other kinds of fowl. In the houses of the great men were bred fish, deer, rabbits, and a variety of birds; and in the royal palaces, almost all the species of quadrupeds and winged animals to be found in these kingdoms were kept, as well as a great number of aquatic animals and reptiles. According to Clavigero, Montezuma II. surpassed all the kings in the world in this kind of magnificence; and\nand there never was a nation equal to the Mexicans in the care they took in taming animals.\n\nPainting was an art in great request among the Mexicans, and one of very great use; as it was only by means of paintings that they recorded their histories. This art they derived, like others, from the Toltecas. Some of these paintings were mere images of their gods, kings, heroes, or of terrestrial objects. Others were historical, containing an account of particular events; others mythological, of which a volume is preserved in the great library of the order of Bologna: others were codes of law, civil and religious; while some were chronological, astronomical, or astrological; in which were represented their calendar, the position of the stars, changes of the moon, eclipses, and prognostications and variations of the weather. Great numbers of these were burned by the superstitious Spaniards, who imagined that they contained some emblems of heathen worship. They had likewise geographical paintings, which served not only to show the extent and boundaries of their possessions, but likewise the situation of places, the direction of the coasts, and the course of the rivers. In his first letter to Charles V. Cortes says, that having made inquiries if there was any secure harbour for vessels on the Mexican coast, Montezuma presented him with a painting of the whole coast, from the port of Vera Cruz, at that time called Chalchiuhuacan, to the river Coatzacualco. Another author informs us also, that Cortes, in a long and difficult voyage which he made to the bay of Honduras, made use of a chart presented to him by the lords of Coatzacualco, in which all the places and rivers were marked from the coast of Coatzacualco to Huejacallan.\n\nThe cloth on which paintings were done was made of the thread of the aloe or a kind of palm; or they painted on sheep's skins or upon paper. This last was made of the leaves of a certain kind of aloe, steeped like hemp, and afterwards washed, stretched, and smoothed. They used also the bark of other trees, prepared with gum: but we are ignorant of the method they used in the manufacture. This paper is similar in thickness to the European pasteboard, but softer, smoother, and more easy for writing. In general it was made up in very long sheets, which they preserved in rolls, or folded like bed-screens. The volume of Mexican paintings, preserved in the library of Bologna, is a thick skin, ill dressed, composed of different pieces painted all over, and folded up in that manner. The beautiful colours which they employed both in their paintings and in their dyes, were obtained from wood, leaves, and the flowers of different plants, as well as from various animal substances. Their white was made from a kind of stone which burns into a fine plaster; or from a mineral, which after being made into a paste worked like clay, and formed into small balls, turns white in the fire like Spanish white. Their black was got from another mineral, which has a disagreeable smell, or from the foot of a kind of pine collected in small earthen vessels. They obtain blue and azure colours from indigo; but their mode of obtaining these was very different from that used by the moderns. They put the branches of the plant into hot, or rather lukewarm, water; and after having stirred them about for a sufficient time with a stick or ladle, they passed the water, when impregnated with the dye, into certain pots or cups, in which they let it remain until the solid part of the dye was deposited; after which they poured off the water. This sediment was first dried in the sun, and afterwards put between two plates before a fire until it grew hard. They had another plant which likewise afforded a blue colour, but inferior to the indigo. Red was obtained from the seeds of the achiot or rocou, and purple from cochineal. Their yellows were ochre, and a colour extracted from the beautiful flower of a plant resembling artemisia. With nitre these flowers afforded a fine orange colour; and by means of alum they extracted other colours.\n\nThe Mexican painters were by no means arrived at much perfection in the knowledge of light and shade, or of design; nevertheless, in some of the ancient paintings, particularly in the portraits of their kings, the proportions were exactly observed. Besides paintings, however, the Mexicans are said to have employed hieroglyphics and characters; but this is absolutely denied by Clavigero; who tells us, that \"they represented material things by their proper figures; but, in order to save labour, paper, and colours, they contented themselves with representing part of an object, which was sufficient to make it understood. But as we cannot understand the writings of others till we have learned to read them; in like manner those American authors, who say that the Mexicans made use of characters, required to have been first instructed in the Mexican manner of representing objects, in order to have been able to understand the paintings which served them in place of writing. When they would represent any person, they painted a man, or a human head, and over it a figure expressing the meaning of his name, as appears in the figures of the Mexican kings. To express a city or village, they painted in like manner a figure which signified the same thing, with its name. To form their histories or annals, they painted on the margin of the cloth or paper the figures of the years in so many squares, and at the side of each square the event or events which happened that year: and if, on account of the number of years, the history of which they meant to relate, they could not all be contained in one canvas, they were continued on another. With respect to the order of representing the years and events, it was at the liberty of the historian to begin at whichever angle of the piece he pleased; but at the same time constantly observing, that if the painting began at the upper angle of the right-hand, he proceeded towards the left; but if it began, as it most commonly did, at the upper angle of the left hand, he proceeded straight downwards. If he painted the first year at the lower angle of the left, he continued towards the right; but if he began at the lower angle of the right, he painted straight upwards: so that on the upper part of his canvas he never painted from left to right, nor ever on the lower part from right to left; never advanced upwards from the left, nor downwards from the right. When this method of the Mexicans is understood, it is easy to discover at first sight which is the beginning and which the ending of any historical painting. Their paintings, however, ought not to be considered as a regular full history, but only as monuments and aids of tradition. We cannot express too strongly\nstrongly the care which parents and masters took to instruct their children and pupils in the history of the nation. They made them learn speeches and discourses which they could not express by the pencil; they put the events of their ancestors into verse, and taught them to sing them. This tradition dispelled the doubts and undid the ambiguity which paintings alone might have occasioned; and, by the affluence of those monuments, perpetuated the memory of their heroes and of virtuous examples, their mythology, rites, laws, and customs.\n\n\"Nor did that people only make use of tradition, paintings, and songs, to preserve the memory of events, but also of threads of different colours and differently knotted. This curious method of the representation of things, however much used in Peru, does not appear to have been employed in the province of Anahuac, if not in the most early ages; for no traces of such monuments are now to be found. Boturini says, that after the most diligent search, he with difficulty found one in a place in Tlascalan, the threads of which were already wasted and consumed by time. If those who peopled South America ever passed the country of Anahuac, they possibly might have left there this art, which was afterwards abandoned for that of painting, introduced by the Toltecan or some other nation still more ancient.\"\n\nThe Mexicans arrived at greater perfection in sculpture, casting of metals, and mosaic works, than in painting. Sculpture was likewise one of the arts exercised by the ancient Toltecan; but the Mexicans had sculptors among them when they left their native country of Atzlan. Several of the Toltec statues, however, were preserved till the time of the conquest, particularly that of the idol Tlaloc, placed upon the mountain of the same name, and some gigantic statues in one of their temples. Stone and wood were the usual materials of their statues: the former was worked with a chisel made of flint; and, in spite of the unfitness of the instrument, such was the phlegmatic nature of the people, that they surmounted every difficulty arising from the tediousness of the work. In their statues they learned to express all the attitudes and postures of which the human body is capable. They observed the proportions exactly, and could when necessary execute the most delicate strokes with the chisel. They not only made entire statues, but cut out in wood and in stone figures in basso rilievo; of which kind are those of Montezuma II., and one of his sons, recorded with praises by Acosta. They also made statues of clay and wood, employing for these a chisel of copper. The number of their statues was in proportion to that of their idols; but so active were the Spanish priests in destroying these, that there is now scarce any vestige of them remaining. The foundation of the first church in Mexico was laid with idols; on which occasion many thousand statues of their gods were necessarily broke in pieces. In casting of metals, however, the Mexicans greatly excelled their works either of painting or sculpture. \"The miracles they produced of this kind (says Clavigero), would not be credible, if, besides the testimony of those who saw them, a great number of curiosities of this kind had not been sent from Mexico to Europe. The works of gold and silver sent in presents from the conqueror Cortes to Charles V., filled the goldsmiths of Europe with astonishment; who, as several authors of that period attest, declared that they were altogether inimitable. The Mexican founders made both of gold and silver the most perfect images of natural bodies. They made a fish in this manner, which had its scales alternately one of silver and the other of gold; a parrot with a moveable head, tongue, and wings; and an ape with a moveable head and feet, having a spindle in its hand in the attitude of spinning. They set gems in gold and silver, and made most curious jewellery of great value. In short, these sort of works were so admirably finished, that even the Spanish soldiers, all stung with the same wretched thirst for gold, valued the workmanship above the materials. This wonderful art, formerly practised by the Toltecan, the invention of which they ascribed to one of their gods, has been entirely lost by the debasement of the Indians, and the indolent neglect of the Spaniards. We are doubtful if there are any remains of these curious works; at least we apprehend that it would be more easy to find them in some of the cabinets of Europe than in all New Spain. Covetousness to profit by the materials must unquestionably have conquered all desire to preserve them as curiosities.\" The works of the Mexicans in gold and silver, executed with the hammer, were much inferior to those of the Europeans.\n\nBut of all the works executed by the ancient Mexicans, those of mosaic were the most curious, as well as mosaic, most highly valued by themselves. These were made of the feathers of birds; and for procuring them they reared a great number of those birds of fine plumage, with which the country abounded, not only in the royal palaces, but also in private houses; and at certain feasts they carried off the feathers for these purposes, or to sell them at market. They valued particularly the feathers of the humming birds, on account of their smallness, fineness, and various colours; and in these, as well as other birds of fine plumage, nature supplied them not only with all the colours producible by art, but likewise with many which art cannot imitate. Their mosaic works, as well as indeed all others of the Mexicans, required infinite patience. At the undertaking of every work of this kind several artists assembled; and having agreed upon a design, and fixed their measures and proportions, each artist charged himself with the execution of a certain part of the image, and exerted himself so diligently in it, that he frequently spent a whole day in adjusting a feather; first trying one and then another, viewing it sometimes one way, then another, until he found one which gave his part that ideal perfection proposed to be attained. When the part which each artist undertook was done, they assembled again to form the entire image from them. If any part happened to be in the least deformed, it was wrought again until it was perfectly finished. They laid hold of the feathers with small pincers, that they might not do them the least injury, and pasted them on the cloth with some glutinous matter; then they united all the parts upon a little table or a plate of copper, and flattened them softly until they left the surface of the image so equal and smooth, that it appeared to be the work of a pencil. These works were prodigiously admired by the Spaniards.\n\nThe Mexicans were skilled in architecture even before\nMexico. fore they left their native country; and many edifices still remain which were constructed by them during their frequent journeys from one place to another. At their first arrival on the lake, they had no other materials to build their houses but reeds and mud, until the success of their commerce allowed them to purchase better materials. When the city came to its perfection, the houses of the principal people were constructed of stone and lime: they consisted of two floors, having halls, large court-yards, and chambers fitly disposed; the roofs were flat and terraced; the walls so well whitened, polished, and shining, that they appeared to the Spaniards when at a distance to have been constructed of silver. The floor was paved with plaster, perfectly level, plain, and smooth. Many of their houses were crowned with battlements and turrets; and their gardens had fish ponds, and the walks of them symmetrically laid out. The large houses had in general two entrances, the principal one to the street, the other to the canal: they had no wooden doors to their houses, but covered the entrance with small reeds, from whence they suspended a string of cocoa shells, or some other materials which would make a noise, so as to awake the attention of the family when any person lifted up the reeds to enter the house.\n\nThe houses of the poorer sort were constructed of reeds, unburnt bricks, stone, or mud; and the roofs made of a kind of a long hay which grows plentifully in the fields, particularly in the warm parts of the country. For this purpose they used also the leaves of the aloe placed in the manner of tiles, to which they bear some resemblance both in thickness and shape. One of the columns or supports of these houses was generally a tree in the vigour of its growth; by which means, besides the pleasure derived from its foliage and shade, they saved themselves some labour and expense. These houses had one or more apartments according to the circumstances of the family.\n\nThe ancient Mexicans understood the method of constructing arches or vaults, as appears from some remains of their buildings as well as from their paintings. They had likewise cornices and other ornaments of architecture. They had also square or cylindrical columns; but it is not known whether they had any capitals or not. They frequently adorned them with figures in bas-relief; but their great ambition was to have them all made out of one stone. The foundations of the large houses in the capital were laid upon beams of cedar driven into the ground, on account of its want of solidity; and the same method is still practised by the Spaniards. The roofs of these were made of cedar, fir, cypress, pine, &c. In the royal palaces the columns were of marble or even of alabaster, which the Spaniards mistook for jasper. In the reign of Ahuizotl a new kind of stone, named tezontli, was discovered in the Mexican lake, which was ever afterwards made use of for building. It is hard, light, and porous like a sponge; by which means the lime adheres very firmly to it. It is valued likewise on account of its colour, which is a blood red. Some of the pavements were chequered with marble and other valuable stones.\n\nThe most remarkable pieces of Mexican architecture were their aqueducts. There were two which conveyed the water to the capital from the distance of two miles. These were constructed of stone and cement five feet high, and two paces broad, upon a road for that purpose upon the lake; by which the water was brought to the entrance of the city, from whence it was sent forth in smaller channels to supply the different fountains. The famous aqueduct of Chempaallan, which was done in the 16th century, is worthy of being ranked among the greatest in Europe. The conductor of this work was a Franciscan missionary named Tembleque; and it was executed with great skill by the Chempaallese. The water was brought from a great distance, and the country through which it must pass was mountainous and rocky; but every difficulty was overcome by the industry of the Mexicans. The aqueduct, including all the turnings and windings, exceeded 30 miles in length. The principal difficulty consisted in crossing three great precipices, over which they were obliged to construct three bridges, the first of 47, the second of 13, and the third of 67 arches. The largest arch was 100 feet high, and 61 broad; so that a large vessel could have passed under it. It must, however, be observed, that, in executing this undertaking, the Mexicans were undoubtedly assisted by European tools, and the directions of European workmen; so that we cannot with strict propriety call it one of their works.\n\nThey were expert jewellers, and understood the art of cutting and polishing the stones, as well as of setting jewels in them. The gems most common in their country were the emeralds, amethysts, carnelians, turquoises, and some others. Emeralds were so common, that no lord or noble wanted them; and none of them died without having one fixed to his lip, that it might serve him, as they imagined, in the other world, instead of a heart. When Cortes returned the first time to Spain, he brought with him five emeralds, valued, by the jewellers there, at 100,000 ducats. The first was in the form of a rose; the second of an horn; the third of a little fish with eyes of gold; the fourth in the form of a bell, with a fine pearl for a clapper. The fifth was a small cup with a foot of gold, and four little golden chains which united in a pearl in the form of a button. For this alone the Genoese merchants offered 40,000 ducats, in order to sell it again to the grand signior. Besides these, he had two emerald vases valued at 300,000 ducats; but these last were lost by shipwreck in the unfortunate expedition of Charles V. against Algiers. There are no such gems wrought at present, nor is it even known where the emerald mines are situated; though it is said there are still some large pieces of this precious stone, in some of the churches; but the priests take care to secure them with iron chains, lest they should be carried off.\n\nIn other more common manufactures the Mexicans were by no means deficient. The earthen ware of Cholula was much praised by the Spaniards; and they had the art of ornamenting this kind of ware with various colours, though they did not understand the making of glass. Their carpenters wrought with instruments of copper; and there are still remains of their labours which display a tolerable skill. Almost every one was acquainted with the method of making cloth. Being destitute of wool, common silk, lint, or hemp, they were obliged to supply the deficiency by other materials. For wool they substituted cotton,\nMexico. for silk they used feathers, the wool of the hare or rabbit; and instead of lint and hemp, they used the fibrous part of the leaves of the aloe. From these last they obtained a thread as fine as from lint; and from some species they had a coarser sort resembling hemp. To obtain this thread they soaked the leaves in water, cleaned them, exposed them to the sun, and then beat them till they were fit to be spun. Sometimes they interwove with their cotton the finest down on the belly of the rabbits or hares, after having spun it into thread; and of these they made most beautiful cloths, which were particularly used for winter waistcoats for the lords. Their cotton manufactures were equal to any produced in Europe; they wove them with different figures and colours, representing different animals and flowers. Of feathers interwoven with cotton they made mantles and bed-curtains, carpets, gowns, &c. These were exceedingly beautiful; but this kind of manufacture is now lost, though there are still some of these garments in the possession of the principal lords, who wear them upon solemn occasions.\n\nAll these advances towards civilization, however, in the ancient Mexicans, were much more than counterbalanced by the horrible barbarities they committed in their religious ceremonies, and in which they exceeded every nation on earth. Human sacrifices were indeed in use among all the ancient heathens; but such prodigious massacres at the dedication of their temples are unheard of in history. Whether they used these barbarous sacrifices in their own country, or whether the practice began with that of the four Xochimilca prisoners, is not known; but as they only used their prisoners or slaves whom they bought in this way, it is impossible that, during the infancy of their state, the number of human victims could have been very great. Most of those unhappy creatures perished by having their breasts opened, and their hearts pulled out; some were drowned, others starved to death with hunger; and sometimes they were burnt. Prisoners of high rank were allowed to die by what Clavigero calls the gladiatorian sacrifice, which was performed in the following manner: Near to the greater temple of large cities, in an open space of ground sufficient to contain an immense number of people, was a round terrace eight feet high, upon which was placed a large round stone resembling a millstone in shape, but much larger, almost three feet high, well polished, and having figures cut upon it. On this stone, which was called temalcatl, the prisoner was placed, armed with a shield and short sword, and tied by one foot. Here he was encountered by a Mexican officer or soldier better armed than himself. If the prisoner was vanquished, he was carried, dead or alive, to the temple, where his heart was taken out and offered in the usual manner; but if he conquered six combatants, he gained his life and liberty. An instance, however, is given in which this custom was infringed; for the Huetzotzinaces having taken the principal lord of Cholula, a man of singular bravery, he overcame seven combatants; notwithstanding which he was put to death; but on this account the Huetzotzinaces were rendered for ever infamous.\n\nNumber of human victims annually sacrificed concerning the number of victims who perished annually in these sacrifices: Clavigero inclines to think it was 20,000, but others make it much more. Zumarraga, the first bishop of Mexico, says in a letter of the 12th of June 1534, addressed to the general chapter of his order, that in that capital alone there were above 20,000 victims annually sacrificed. Some authors, quoted by Gomara, say that 50,000 were annually sacrificed in the various parts of the empire. Acoita says, that there was a certain day of the year on which they sacrificed 5000 victims, and another on which 20,000 were sacrificed. According to others they sacrificed, on the mountain Tepeyacac only, 20,000 annually to one of their female deities. On the other hand, Bartholomew de las Casas reduces the number of human victims to 50 or at most to 100.\n\n\"We are strongly of opinion (says Clavigero), that all these authors have erred in the number; Las Casas by diminution, and the rest by exaggerating the truth.\"\n\nBesides the cruelties which they practised upon others, the Mexicans were accustomed to treat themselves with the most inhuman severities, thinking that the diabolical rage of their deities would be appeased by human blood. \"It makes one shudder (says Clavigero), to read the severities which they practised upon themselves, either in atonement for their transgressions, or in preparation for their festivals. They mangled their flesh as if it had been insensible, and let their blood run in such profusion as if it had been a superfluous fluid in the body.\" The effusion of blood was frequent and daily with some of their priests. They pierced themselves with the sharpest spines of the aloe, and bored several parts of their bodies, particularly their ears, lips, tongue, and the fat of their arms and legs. Through the holes which they made with these spines they introduced pieces of cane, the first of which were small; but every time this penitential suffering was renewed, a thicker piece was made use of. The blood which flowed from them was carefully collected in the leaves of the plant acajatl. They fixed the bloody spines in little balls of hay, which they exposed upon the battlements of the walls of the temple, to testify the penance which they did for the people. Those who exercised such severities upon themselves within the enclosure of the greater temple of Mexico, bathed in a pond that was formed there, and which, from being always tinged with blood, was called exapam.\n\nThe dress of the Mexicans was very simple; that of the men consisted only of a large belt or girdle, the two ends of which hung down before and behind; the women wore a square mantle, about four feet long; the two ends were tied upon the breast or upon one shoulder. The Mexican gown was also a piece of square cloth, in which the women wrapped themselves from the waist down to the middle of the leg. They wore also a small under vest or waistcoat without sleeves, named huepilli.\n\nThe dress of the poorer sort was made of the thread of the mountain palm, or of coarse cotton; but those of better station wore the finest cotton embellished with various colours, and figures of animals or flowers; or woven with feathers, or the fine hair of the rabbit, &c. The men wore two or three mantles, and the women three or four veils, and as many gowns, putting the longest undermost, so that a part of each of them might be seen. Their shoes were only soles of leather, or coarse cloth of the mountain palm tied with\nMexico, with strings; but those of the great people were adorned with ribbands of gold and jewels. They all wore long hair, and thought themselves dishonoured by being shaved, or having their hair clipped, except the consecrated virgins in the temple. The women wore it loose; but the men tied it up in different forms, and adorned their heads with fine feathers, both when they danced and went to war. With this simplicity, however, they mixed no small quantity of extravagance. Besides feathers and jewels, with which they used to adorn their heads, they wore ear-rings, pendants at their upper lip, as well as many at their noses, necklaces, bracelets for the hands and arms, as well as certain rings like collars which they wore about their legs. The ear-rings of the poor were shells, pieces of crystal, amber, &c.; but the rich wore pearls, emeralds, amethysts, or other gems set in gold.\n\nInstead of soap the Mexicans used a kind of root called copalxocotl; the pulp of which is white, viscous, and very bitter, makes water white, raises a froth, and will clean linen like soap. They used also a kind of root named amalli, which is not unlike the saponaria of the old continent. It is now more used for washing the body, especially the head, than for clothes. Clavigero says, that there is a kind of this root which dyes the hair of a golden colour, and that he has been witness to this effect on the hair of an old man.\n\nThe principal inhabitants of Mexico, in modern times, are Spaniards sent thither by the court, to fill the posts of government. They are obliged, like those in the mother country who aspire to any ecclesiastical, civil, or military employments, to prove that there have been neither heretics, Jews, Mohammedans, nor any person in their family who has been called before the inquisition for four generations. Merchants who are desirous of going to Mexico, as well as to other parts of America, without becoming colonists, are compelled to observe the same forms. They are also obliged to swear that they have 300 palms of merchandise, their own property, in the fleet in which they embark, and that they will not carry their wives with them. On these absurd conditions they become the principal agents of the European commerce with the Indies. Though their charter is only to continue three years, and a little longer for countries more remote, it is of great importance. To them alone belongs the right of selling, as commissioners, the major part of the cargo. If these laws were observed, the merchants stationed in the new world would be confined to dispose of what they have received on their own account.\n\nThe predilection which administration has for Spaniards born in Europe, has reduced the Spanish Creoles to acquiesce in subordinate stations. The descendants of the companions of Cortes, and of those who came after them, being constantly excluded from all places of honour or of trust that were any way considerable, have seen the gradual decay of the power that supported their fathers. The habit of being obliged to bear that unjust contempt with which they have been treated, has at last made them become really contemptible. They have totally lost, in the vices which originate from indolence, from the heat of the climate, and from a superfluous enjoyment of all things, that firmness and that sort of pride which have ever characterized their nation. A barbarous luxury, shameful pleasures, and romantic intrigues, have enervated all the vigour of their minds; and superstition hath completed the ruin of their virtues. Blindly devoted to priests too ignorant to enlighten them by their instructions, too depraved to edify them by their example, and too mercenary to attend to both these duties of their function, they have no attachment to any part of their religion but that which enfeebles the mind; and have neglected what might have contributed to rectify their morals.\n\nThe Metees, who constitute the third order of citizens, are held in still greater contempt. It is well known that the court of Madrid, in order to replenish a part of that dreadful vacancy which the avarice and cruelty of the conquerors had occasioned, and to regain the confidence of those who had escaped their fury, encouraged as much as possible the marriage of Spaniards with Indian women. These alliances, which became pretty common throughout all America, were particularly frequent in Mexico, where the women had more understanding and were more agreeable than in other places. The Creoles transferred to this mixed progeny the contemptuous flight they received from the Europeans. Their condition, equivocal at first, in process of time was fixed between the whites and the blacks.\n\nThese blacks are not very numerous in Mexico. As the natives are more intelligent, more robust, and more industrious, than those of the other colonies, they have hardly introduced any Africans except such as were required either to indulge the caprice, or perform the domestic service, of rich people. These slaves, who are much beloved by their masters, on whom they absolutely depend, who purchased them at an extravagant price, and who make them the ministers of their pleasures, take advantage of the high favour they enjoy, to oppress the Mexicans. They assume over these men, who are called free, an ascendancy which keeps up an implacable hatred between the two nations. The law has studied to encourage this aversion, by taking effectual measures to prevent all connexion between them. Negroes are prohibited from having any amorous correspondence with the Indians; the men, on pain of being mutilated; the women, of being severely punished. On all these accounts, the Africans, who in other settlements are enemies to the Europeans, are in the Spanish Indies their warm friends.\n\nAuthority has no need of this support, at least in Mexico, where population is no longer what it was formerly. The first historians, and those who copied them, have recorded, that the Spaniards found there 10,000,000 of souls. This is supposed to have been the exaggerated account of conquerors, to exalt the magnificence of their triumph; and it was adopted, without examination, with so much the more readiness, as it rendered them the more odious. We need only trace with attention the progress of those savages who at first desolated these fine countries, in order to be convinced that they had not succeeded in multiplying men at Mexico and the adjacent parts, but by depopulating the centre of the empire; and that the provinces which are remote from the capital, differed in nothing from the other deserts of South and North America.\nAmerica. It is making a great concession, to allow that the population of Mexico has only been exaggerated one-half; for it does not now much exceed 2,000,000.\n\nIt is generally believed, that the first conquerors massacred the Indians out of wantonness, and that even the priests incited them to these acts of ferocity. Undoubtedly these inhuman soldiers frequently shed blood without even an apparent motive; and certainly their fanatic militarists did not oppose these barbarities as they ought to have done. This was not, however, the real cause, the principal source of the depopulation of Mexico; it was the work of a slow tyranny, and of that avarice which exacted from its wretched inhabitants more rigorous toil than was compatible with their constitution and the climate.\n\nThis oppression was coeval with the conquest of the country. All the lands were divided between the crown, the companions of Cortes, and the grandees or ministers who were most in favour at the court of Spain. The Mexicans, appointed to the royal domains, were destined to public labours, which originally were considerable. The lot of those who were employed on the estates of individuals was still more wretched. All groaned under a dreadful yoke; they were ill fed; they had no wages given them; and services were required of them, under which the most robust men would have sunk. Their misfortunes excited the compassion of Bartholomew de las Casas.\n\nThis man, so famous in the annals of the new world, had accompanied his father in the first voyage made by Columbus. The mildness and simplicity of the Indians affected him so strongly, that he made himself an ecclesiastic, in order to devote his labours to their conversion. But this soon became the least of his attention. As he was more a man than a priest, he felt more for the cruelties exercised against them than for their superstitions. He was continually hurrying from one hemisphere to the other, in order to comfort the people for whom he had conceived an attachment, or to soften their tyrants. This conduct, which made him be idolized by the one and dreaded by the other, had not the success he expected. The hope of striking awe, by a character revered among the Spaniards, determined him to accept the bishopric of Chiapa in Mexico. When he was convinced that this dignity was an insufficient barrier against that avarice and cruelty which he endeavoured to check, he abdicated it. It was then that this courageous, firm, disinterested man, accused his country before the tribunal of the whole universe. In his account of the tyranny of the Spaniards in America, he accuses them of having destroyed 15,000,000 of Indians. They ventured to find fault with the acrimony of his style; but no one convicted him of exaggeration. His writings, which indicate the amiable turn of his disposition, and the sublimity of his sentiments, have stamped a disgrace upon his barbarous countrymen, which time hath not, and never will, efface.\n\nThe court of Madrid, awakened by the representations of the virtuous Las Casas, and by the indignation of the whole world, became sensible at last, that the tyranny it permitted was repugnant to religion, to humanity, and to policy; and resolved to break the chains of the Mexicans. Their liberty was now only constrained by the sole condition, that they should not quit the territory where they were settled. This precaution owed its origin to the fear that was entertained of their going to join the wandering savages to the north and south of the empire.\n\nWith their liberty their lands ought also to have been restored to them; but this was not done. This injustice compelled them to work solely for their oppressors. It was only decreed, that the Spaniards, in whose service they laboured, should stipulate to keep them well, and pay them to the amount of 5l. 5s. a-year.\n\nFrom these profits the tribute imposed by government was subtracted, together with 4s. 4\u00bdd. for an institution which it is astonishing the conquerors should have thought of establishing. This was a fund set apart in each community, and appropriated to the relief of such Indians as were decayed or indigent, and to their support under private or public calamities.\n\nThe distribution of this fund was committed to their caciques. These were not the descendants of those whom they found in the country at the time of the conquest. The Spaniards chose them from among those Indians who appeared the most attached to their interests; and were under no apprehensions at making these dignities hereditary. Their authority was limited to the supporting the police in their district, which in general extended eight or ten leagues; to the collecting the tribute of those Indians who laboured on their own account, that of the others being stopped by the masters whom they served; and to the preventing their flight by keeping them always under their inspection, and not suffering them to contract any engagement without their consent. As a reward of their services, these magistrates obtained from government a property. They were permitted to take out of the common stock 2\u00bdd. annually for every Indian under their jurisdiction. At last they were empowered to get their fields cultivated by such young men as were not yet subject to the poll tax; and to employ girls, till the time of their marriage, in such occupations as were adapted to their sex, without allowing them any salary except their maintenance.\n\nThese institutions, which totally changed the condition of the Indians of Mexico, irritated the Spaniards to a degree not to be conceived. Their pride would not suffer them to consider the Americans as free men; nor would their avarice permit them to pay for labour which hitherto had cost them nothing. They employed themselves successively, or in combination, craft, remonstrances, and violence, to effect the subversion of an arrangement which so strongly contradicted their warmest passions; but their efforts were ineffectual. Las Casas had raised up for his beloved Indians protectors who seconded his design with zeal and warmth. The Mexicans themselves, finding a support, impeached their oppressors before the tribunals; and even the tribunals that were either weak or in the interest of the court. They carried their resolution so far, as even unanimously to refuse to work for those who had treated any of their countrymen with injustice. This mutual agreement, more than any other circumstance, gave solidity to the regulations.\nMexico. gulations which had been decreed. The other, prescribed by the laws, was gradually established. There was no longer any regular system of oppression; but merely several of those particular vexations which a vanquished people, who have lost their government, can hardly avoid from those who have subdued it.\n\nThese clandestine acts of injustice did not prevent the Mexicans from recovering, from time to time, certain detached portions of that immense territory of which their fathers had been deprived. They purchased them of the royal domain, or of the great proprietors. It was not their labour which enabled them to make these acquisitions: for this they were indebted to the happiness of having discovered, some of them mines, others treasures which had been concealed at the time of the conquest. The greatest number derived their resources from the priests and monks, to whom they owed their existence.\n\nEven those who experienced a fortune less propitious, procured for themselves, by the sole profits of their pay, more conveniences than they had enjoyed before they underwent a foreign yoke. We should be very much deceived, were we to judge of the ancient prosperity of the inhabitants of Mexico by what has been said of its emperor, its court, its capital, and the governors of its provinces. Despotism had there produced those fatal effects which it produces everywhere. The whole state was sacrificed to the caprices, pleasures, and magnificence, of a small number of persons.\n\nThe government drew considerable advantages from the mines which it caused to be worked, and still greater from those which were in the hands of individuals. The salt works greatly added to its revenue. Those who followed agriculture, at the time of harvest paid in a kind of a third of all the produce of the lands, whether they belonged to them as their own property, or whether they were only the farmers of them. Men who lived by the chase, fishermen, potters, and all mechanics, paid the same proportion of their industry every month. Even the poor were taxed at certain fixed contributions, which their labour or their aims might put them in a condition to pay.\n\nThe Mexicans are now less unhappy. Our fruits, our corn, and our cattle, have rendered their food more wholesome, agreeable, and abundant. Their houses are better built, better disposed, and better furnished. Shoes, drawers, shirts, a garment of wool or cotton, a ruff, and a hat, constitute their dress. The dignity which it has been agreed to annex to these enjoyments has made them better economists, and more laborious. This case, however, is far from being universal; it is even very uncommon in the vicinity of the mines, towns, and great roads, where tyranny seldom sleeps; but we often find it with satisfaction in remote parts, where the Spaniards are not numerous, and where they have in some measure become Mexicans.\n\nThe employments of this people are very various. The most intelligent, and those who are in easy circumstances, devote themselves to the most necessary and most useful manufactures, which are dispersed through the whole empire. The most beautiful manufactures are established among the people of Tlalcalca. Their old capital, and the new one, which is called Angelos, are the centre of this industry. Here they manufacture cloth that is pretty fine, calicoes that have an agreeable appearance, certain flight silks, good hats, gold lace, embroidery, lace, glafles, and a great deal of hardware.\n\nThe care of flocks affords a maintenance to some Mexicans, whom fortune or nature have not called to more distinguished employments. America, at the time it was discovered, had neither hogs, sheep, oxen, the cows, nor even any domestic animal. Columbus carried none of these useful animals to St Domingo, from whence they were generally dispersed; and in Mexico, more than in any other place, they have multiplied prodigiously. They count their horned cattle by thousands, whose skins are become an object of considerable exportation. The horses are degenerated, but the quality is compensated by the number. Hogs' lard is here substituted for butter. Sheep's wool is dry, coarse, and bad, as it is everywhere between the tropics.\n\nThe vine and olive tree have experienced the same degeneracy. The cultivation of them was at first prohibited, with a view of leaving a free market for the commodities of the mother country. In 1706, permission was given to the Jesuits, and a little afterwards to the marquis Del Valle, a descendant of Cortes, to cultivate them. The attempts have not proved successful. The trials, indeed, that have been made, have not been abandoned; but no person has solicited the liberty of following an example which did not promise any great emoluments. Other cultures have been more successful. Cotton, sugar, silk, cocoa, tobacco, and European corn, have all thriven in some degree. The Spaniards are encouraged to prosecute the labours which these cultures require, from the happy circumstance of their having discovered iron mines, which were entirely unknown to the Mexicans, as well as some mines of a kind of copper that is hard enough to serve for implements of husbandry. All these articles, however, for want of men and industry, are merely consumed within the country.\u2014There is only the vanilla, indigo, and cochineal, which make part of the trade of Mexico with other nations.\n\nNew Mexico, so called because of its being discovered later than Old Mexico, a country of America, is bounded on the north by high mountains, beyond which is a country altogether unknown; by Louisiana on the east; by New Spain on the south; and on the west by the gulf of California, and the Rio Colorado; extending, it is said, above 1000 miles from east to west, and about 900 from south to north; but the twentieth part of the country within these limits is neither cultivated nor inhabited either by Spaniards or Indians. As it lies in the midst of the temperate zone, the climate, in general, is very pleasant; the summers, though very warm, are neither sultry nor unwholesome; and the winters, though pretty sharp, are far from being insupportable, and, for the most part clear and healthy.\n\nThe greatest encomiums are lavished on the fertility of the soil, the richness of the mines, and the variety of valuable commodities produced in this country. It is said to be beautifully diversified with fields, meadows,\nMexico, rising grounds, and rivers; abounding with fruit and timber trees, turquoises, emeralds, and other precious stones, mines of gold and silver, a great variety of wild and tame cattle, fish and fowls. Upon the whole, we may safely affirm, that New Mexico is among the pleasantest, richest, and most plentiful countries in America, or any other part of the world. There are few great or navigable rivers in it: the most considerable are, the Rio Solado and Rio del Norte, which, with several smaller streams, fall into the gulf of Mexico. On the coast of the gulf are divers bays, ports, and creeks, which might be easily converted into excellent harbours, if the Spaniards were possessed of any portion of that commercial spirit which animates the other maritime nations of Europe.\n\nThe Spanish writers tell us, that New Mexico is inhabited by a great variety of Indian nations or tribes, totally unconnected with each other; but the principal are the Apaches, a brave, warlike, resolute people; fond of liberty, and the inveterate enemies of tyranny and oppression. About the close of the 17th century, thinking themselves aggrieved by the Spanish government, they made a general insurrection, and did a great deal of mischief; but were at last obliged to submit, and have since been curbed by stronger garrisons. Most of the natives are now Christians. When the Spaniards first entered this country, they found the natives well clothed, their lands cultivated, their villages neat, and their houses built with stone. Their flocks also were numerous, and they lived more comfortably than most of the other savages of America. As to religion, they were idolaters, and worshipped the sun and moon; but whether they offered human sacrifices, we are not sufficiently informed.\n\nThe number of provinces in this country is not well ascertained: some writers making them only five, others 10, 15, 20, and 25; but adding no description, either of them or the towns contained in them, excepting the capital, Santa F\u00e9, which we are told stands near the source of the Rio del Norte, in 36\u00b0 north latitude, and about 130 leagues from the gulf: that it is a well built, handsome, rich town; and the seat of the bishop, suffragan of Mexico, as well as the governor of the province, who is subordinate to the viceroy of Mexico or New Spain.","sp":353,"ep":394},{"h":"MEZERAY","t":"Francis Eudes de, an eminent French historian, the son of Isaac Eudes a surgeon, was born at Rye, in Lower Normandy, in 1610; and took the surname of Mezeray, from a hamlet near Rye. Having performed his studies at Caen, he discovered a strong inclination to poetry; but going to Paris, he, by the advice of one of his friends, applied himself to the study of politics and history, and procured the place of commissary at war, which he held for two campaigns. He then shut himself up in the college of St Barbe, in the midst of books and manuscripts; and, in 1643, published the first volume of the History of France, in folio; and some years after, the other two volumes. Mezeray in that work surpassed all who had written the history of France before him, and was rewarded by the king with a pension of 400 livres. In 1668, he published an Abridgement of his History of France, in three volumes 4to, which was well received by the public; but as he inserted in that work the origin of most of the taxes, with very free reflections, M. Colbert complained of it, when Mezeray promised to correct what he had done in a second edition; but those corrections being only palliations, the minister caused half of his pension to be suppressed. Mezeray complained of this in very severe terms; when he obtained no other answer than the suppression of the other half. Vexed at this treatment, he resolved to write on subjects that could not expose him to such disappointments; and composed his treatise on the origin of the French, which did him much honour. He was elected perpetual secretary to the French academy; and died in 1683. He is said to have been a man extremely negligent in his person, and so careless in his dress, that he might have passed for a beggar rather than for what he was. He was actually seized one morning by the archers des pavillons, or parish officers; which mistake was so far from provoking him, that he was highly diverted with it, and told them, that he was not able to walk on foot, but that as soon as a new wheel was put to his chariot, he would attend them wherever they thought proper. He used to study and write by candle light, even at noon-day in summer; and, as if there had been no fun in the world, always waited upon his company to the door with a candle in his hand. With regard to religion, he affected Pyrrhouism; which however was not, it seems, so much in his heart as in his mouth. This appeared from his last sickness; for having sent for those friends who had been the most usual witnesses of his licentious talk about religion, he made a sort of recantation, which he concluded with desiring them \"to forget what he might formerly have said upon the subject of religion, and to remember, that Mezeray dying was a better believer than Mezeray in health.\" Besides his history, he also wrote, 1. A continuation of the history of the Turks. 2. A French translation of John de Salisbury's Latin treatise on the vanities of the court. 3.

But the Hebrew doctors imagined, that the lawgiver meant something more than this. They pretended that, to avoid making themselves ridiculous, by writing the commandments of God without their doors, or rather to avoid exposing themselves to the profanation of the wicked, they ought at least to write them on a parchment, and to enclose it in something. Therefore they wrote these words upon a square piece of parchment prepared on purpose, with a particular ink, and a square kind of character. Deut. vi. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. \"Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord,\" &c.\u2014Then they left a little space, and afterwards went on, Deut. xi. 13. \"And it shall come to pass if thou shalt hearken diligently to my commandments,\" &c., as far as, \"Thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thy house,\" &c. After this they rolled up the parchment, and put it into a case of reeds or other matter; they wrote on the end of the case the word Shaddai, which is one of the names of God; and they put it at the doors of their houses, chambers, and all places most frequented; they fixed it to the knockers of the door, on the right side; and as often as they entered in or went out they touched it in this place, with the end of their finger, which they afterwards kissed out of devotion.

See Engraving.\n\nThe invention of this art has been usually attributed to Prince Rupert. But Baron Heinikin, a very judicious and accurate writer upon the subject of engraving, affirms, with great appearance of truth, that it was a lieutenant-colonel de Siegan, an officer in the service of the landgrave of Hesse, who first engraved in this manner; and that the print which he produced was a portrait of the princess Amelia Elizabeth of Hesse, engraved in the year 1643. Prince Rupert learned the secret from this gentleman, and brought it into England when he came over the second time with Charles II. Prince Rupert's print of An Executioner holding a Sword in one Hand and a Head in the other, a half length, from Spagnoletto, is dated 1658. This art has never been cultivated with success in any country but England.\n\nThe prince laid his grounds on the plate with a channelled roller: but one Sherwin, about the same time, laid his grounds with a half-round file, which was pressed down with a heavy piece of lead. Both these grounding tools have been laid aside for many years; and a hand tool, resembling a shoemaker's cutting board knife, with a fine crenelling on the edge, was introduced by one Edial, a smith by trade, who afterwards became a mezzotinto painter.\n\nIt is very different from the common way of engraving. To perform it, they rake, hatch, or punch, the surface of the plate all over with a knife, or instrument made for the purpose, first one way, then the other, across, &c. till the surface of the plate be thus entirely furrowed with lines or furrows, close and as it were contiguous to each other; so that, if an impression was then taken from it, it would be one uniform blot or smut. This done, the design is drawn or marked on the same face; after which, they proceed with burnishers, scrapers, &c. to expunge and take out the dents or furrows, in all the parts where the lights of the piece are to be; and that more or less as the lights are to be stronger or fainter; leaving those parts black which are to represent the shadows or deepenings of the draught.\n\nAs it is much easier to scrape or burnish away parts of a dark ground corresponding with the outline of any design sketched upon it, than to form shades upon a light ground by an infinite number of hatches, strokes, and points, which must all terminate with exactness on the outline, as well as differ in their force and manner; the method of scraping, as it is called, in mezzotinto, consequently becomes much more easy and expeditious than any other method of engraving. The instruments used in this kind of engraving are cradles, scrapers, and burnishers.\n\nIn this engraving, the plate must be prepared and polished in the same manner as for other engraving; and afterwards divided equally by lines parallel to each other, and traced out with very soft chalk. The distance of these lines should be about one-third of the length of the face of the cradle which is to be used, and these lines should be marked with capital letters, or strokes of the chalk. The cradle is then to be placed exactly betwixt the two first lines, and passed forwards in the same direction; being kept as steady as possible, and pressed upon with a moderate force. The same operation must be repeated with respect to all the other lines; till the instrument has thus passed over the whole surface of the plate.\u2014Other lines must be then drawn from the extremities of the other two sides, in the same manner; which, intersecting the first at right angles, will with them form squares; and the same operation must be repeated with the cradle as in the case of the first. New lines must then be drawn diagonally, and the cradle passed betwixt them as before; and when the first diagonal operation is performed, the lines must be crossed at right angles as the former, and the cradles passed betwixt them in the same manner.\u2014The plate having undergone the action of the cradle, according to the disposition of the first order of lines, a second set must be formed, having the same distances from each other as the first. But they must be\nso placed as to divide those already made into spaces one-third less than their whole extent; i.e., every one after the first on each side will take in one-third of that before it, e.g., beginning at A, of which the first third must be left out; a third of B will consequently be taken in, and so of the rest. These lines of the second order must be marked with small letters, or lesser strokes, to distinguish them from the first; and the same treatment of the plate must be pursued with respect to them as was practised for the others. When this second operation is finished, a third order of lines must be made; the first of which, e.g., in A, must omit two-thirds of it, and consequently take in two-thirds of B, &c. By these means, the original spaces will be exactly divided into equal thirds; and the cradle must be again employed betwixt these lines as before.\n\nWhen the whole of this operation is finished, it is called one turn; but in order to produce a very dark and uniform ground, the plate must undergo the repetition of all these several operations for above twenty times; beginning to pass the cradle again between the first lines, and proceeding in the same manner through all the rest. When the plate is prepared with a proper ground, the sketch must be chalked on it, by rubbing the paper on the backside with chalk. It is also proper to overtrace it afterwards with black lead or Indian ink. The scraping is then performed, by paring or cutting away the grain of the ground in various degrees; so that none of it is left in the original state except in the touches of the strongest shade. The general manner of proceeding is the same as drawing with white upon black paper. The masses of light are first begun with; and those parts which go off into light in their upper part, but are brown below: the reflections are then entered upon; after which the plate is blackened with a printer's blacking-ball made of felt, in order to discover the effect: and then the work is proceeded with; observing always to begin every part in the places where the strongest lights are to be.\n\nThe art of scraping mezzotintos has been applied to the printing with a variety of colours, in order to produce the resemblance of paintings. The inventor of the method of doing this was J. C. Le Blon, a native of Frankfort, and pupil of Carlo Marata, between the years 1720 and 1730. It was established by the inventor on this principle, that there are three primitive colours, of which all the rest may be composed by mixing them in various proportions; that any two of these colours being mixed together, preserve their original power, and only produce a third colour such as their compound must necessarily give; but if transparent colours be mixed, and three primitive kinds compounded together, they destroy each other, and produce black, or a tendency to it, in proportion to the equality or inequality of the mixture; and that if, therefore, these three colours be laid, either separately or upon each other, by three plates, engraved correspondently on these principles to the colouring of the design, the whole variety of tints necessary may be produced. The requisites, therefore, to the execution of any design in this method of printing are as follows:\n\n1. To settle a plan of the colouring to be imitated; showing where the presence of each of the three simple colours is necessary, either in its pure state or combined with some other, to produce the effect required; and to reduce this plan to a painted sketch of each, in which not only the proper outlines, but the degree of strength should be expressed.\n\n2. To engrave three plates according to this plan, which may print each of the colours exactly in the places where, and proportion in which, they are wanted.\n\n3. To find three transparent substances proper for printing with these three primitive colours. The manner in which M. Le Blon prepared the plates was as follows: The three plates of copper were first well fitted with respect to size and figure to each other, and grounded in the same manner as those designed for mezzotinto prints: and the exact place and boundary of each of the three primitive colours, conformably to the design, were sketched out on three papers, answering in dimensions to the plate. These sketches were then chalked on the plates; and all the parts of each plate that were not to convey the colour to which it was appropriated to the print, were entirely scraped away, as in forming the light of mezzotinto prints. The parts that were to convey the colours were then worked upon; and where the most light or diluted teints of the colour were to be, the grain in the ground was proportionally taken off; but where the full colour was required, it was left entire. In this regard was had, not only to the effects of the colour in its simple state, but to its combined operation, either in producing orange-colour, green, or purple, by its admixture with one alone; and likewise to its forming brown, gray, and shades of different degrees, by its co-operation with both the others. But though the greatest part of the engraving was performed in the mezzotinto manner, yet the graver was employed occasionally for strengthening the shades, and for correcting the outline where it required great accuracy and steadiness. It was found necessary sometimes to have two separate plates for printing the same colour, in order to produce a stronger effect; but the second plate, which was used to print upon the first, was intended only to glaze and soften the colours in particular parts that might require it. With respect to the black and brown teints, which could not be so conveniently produced in a due degree by the mixture of the colours, umber and black were likewise used.\n\nWith respect to the order in which the plates are to be applied, it may be proper to observe, that the colour which is least apparent in the picture should be laid on first; that which is betwixt the most and least apparent next; and that which predominates last; except where there may be occasion for two plates for the same colour, as was before mentioned; or where there is any required for adding browns and shades.\n\nM. Le Blon applied this art to portraits, and showed, by the specimens he produced, the possibility of its being brought, by farther improvements, to afford imitations of painting which might have some value. It is nevertheless much better adapted to the simpler subjects, where there are fewer intermixtures of colours; and where the accuracy of the reflections, and demi-teints, are not so essentially necessary to the truth of the design, from the greater latitude of form, and disposition of the colour, as in plants, anatomical figures, and some subjects of architecture. But perhaps plates engraved...\nMiasma graved or rather finished with the tool, particularly with respect to the outline, would be better accommodated in some of these cases than those prepared only by scraping.\n\nM. Cochin remarks, at the end of an account he has given of M. le Blon's manner, that though this ingenious artist confined his method principally to the use of three colours; yet, should this invention be again taken up and cultivated, there would be more probability of success in using a greater variety; and that several different kinds might be printed by one plate, provided they were laid on in their respectively proper places by printing-balls, which should be used for that colour only. His hint might however be very greatly improved, by the further affluence of pencils, accommodated to the plates, for laying on the colours in the proper parts.\u2014For the method of taking off mezzotinto prints on glass, see Back-painting.","sp":395,"ep":397},{"h":"MIASMA","t":"among physicians, a particular kind of effluvia, by which certain fevers, particularly intermittents, are produced.","sp":397,"ep":397},{"h":"MICAH","t":"or The Book of Micah, a canonical book of the Old Testament, written by the prophet Micah, who is the sixth of the twelve lesser prophets.

The scripture account of Michael is, that he was an archangel, who presided over the Jewish nation, as other angels did over the Gentile world, as is evident of the kingdoms of Persia and Greece, (Dan. x. 13.) that he had an army of angels under his command (Rev. xii. 7.) that he fought with the Dragon, or Satan and his angels; and that, contending with the Devil, he disputed about the body of Moses, (Jude 9.) As to the combat between Michael and the Dragon, some authors understand it literally, and think it means the expulsion of certain rebellious angels, with their head or leader, from the presence of God. Others take it in a figurative sense; and refer it, either to the contest that happened at Rome between St Peter and Simon Magus, in which the apostle prevailed over the magician, or to those violent persecutions under which the church laboured for three hundred years, and which happily ceased when the powers of the world became Christian. Among the commentators who maintain the former opinion is Grotius; and among those who take it in a figurative sense are Hammond and Mede.\n\nThe contest about the body of Moses is likewise taken both literally and figuratively. Those who understand it literally are of opinion, that Michael by the order of God hid the body of Moses after his death; and that the Devil endeavoured to discover it, as a fit means to entice the people to idolatry, by a superstitious worship of his relics. But this dispute is figuratively understood to be a controversy about rebuilding the temple, and restoring the service of God among the Jews at Jerusalem; the Jewish church being fitly styled the body of Moses. It is thought by some, that this story of the contest between Michael and the Devil was taken by St Jude out of an apocryphal book called The Assumption of Moses.\n\nThe Roman church celebrates three appearances of Michael, of which no mention is made in scripture, and which have happened, they say, a long time after the age of the apostles. The first appearance of this archangel was at Colossae in Phrygia, but at what time is uncertain. The second is that of Mount Garganus, in the kingdom of Naples, about the end of the fifth century. The third is his appearance to Aubert bishop of Avranches, upon a rock called the Tomb, where at this day is the abbey of St Michael. This was about the year 756. The first of these festivals is observed on the 6th of September, the second on the 8th of May, and the last on the 16th of October. It has been supposed, that it was Michael the archangel who conducted the Israelites in their journey through the wilderness, (see Exod. xxxii. 20, 23, and xxxiii. 2;) that it was he who appeared to Moses in the burning bush; who appeared to Joshua in the fields of Jericho, and to Gideon and Manoah the father of Samson; and, in a word, to him have been imputed the greatest part of the most remarkable appearances either in the Old or New Testament.\n\nMICHAEL ANGELO. See ANGELO.\n\nMount MICHAEL, formerly one of the most celebrated slate prisons of France, lies about 20 miles from Granville. It is a rock situated in the middle of the bay of Avranches; and is only accessible at low water. Nature has completely fortified one side, by its craggy and almost perpendicular descent, which renders it impracticable to mount it by any address or courage, however consummate. The other parts are surrounded by walls fenced with semilunar towers after the Gothic manner; but sufficiently strong, together with the advantage of its situation, to render it impregnable to any attack. At the foot of the mountain begins a street or town, which winds round its base to a considerable height. Above are chambers where state prisoners are kept, and where there are other buildings intended for residence. On the summit is erected the abbey itself, occupying a prodigious space of ground, and of a strength and solidity equal to its enormous size; since it has for many centuries withstood all the injuries of the weather; to which it is so much exposed. In an apartment, called the Sale de Chavalerie, the knights of St Michael used to meet in solemn convocation on important occasions. They were the defenders and guardians of this mountain and abbey, as those of the Temple, and of St John of Jerusalem, were of the holy sepulchre. The hall in which they met is very spacious, but rude and barbarous. At one end is a painting of the archangel, the patron of their order; and in this hall Louis XI. first instituted and invested with the insignia of knighthood the chevaliers of the cross of St Michael. There is a miserable dark apartment, or rather dungeon, in which many eminent persons were formerly confined. In the middle of it is a cage, composed of prodigious bars of wood; and the wicket which gives entrance into it is 10 or 12 inches in thickness. The inside of it comprises about 12 or 14 feet square, and it is nearly 20 in height. Towards\nwards the latter end of the 17th century, a newswriter in Holland, who had presumed to print some very fevered and sarcastic reflections on Madame de Maintenon, was confined in this place. Some months after his publication, he was induced, by a person sent expressly for that purpose, to make a tour into French Flanders. The moment he had quitted the Dutch territories, he was put under arrest; and immediately, by his majesty's express command, conducted to Mount Michael, where he was shut up in this cage. Here he lived upwards of 23 years; and here he at length expired. During the long nights of winter, no candle or fire was allowed him. He was not permitted to have any book. He saw no human face, except the gaoler, who came once every day to present him, through a hole in the wicket, with his little portion of bread and wine. No instrument was given him with which he could destroy himself; but he found means at length to draw out a nail from the wood, with which he engraved, or cut on the bars of his cage, certain fleurs de lis and armorial bearings, which formed his only employment and recreation. They are very curiously performed considering the rudeness of his instrument.\n\nThe subterraneous chambers in this mountain are said to be so numerous, that the gaolers themselves do not know them. There are certain dungeons called abbelettes, into which they were accustomed anciently to let down malefactors guilty of very heinous crimes: they provided them with a loaf of bread and a bottle of wine, and then they were totally forgotten, and left to perish by hunger in the dark vaults of the rock. This punishment, however, has not been inflicted by any king in the last or present century.\n\nHere also is a remarkable chamber, in one corner of which is a kind of window: between this and the wall of the building is a very deep space, of near 100 feet perpendicular, at the bottom of which is another window opening to the sea. It is called the Hole of Montgomery; and the history of it is as follows: In the year 1559, Henry II. king of France was unfortunately killed at a tournament by the count de Montgomery*. He was a Huguenot; and having escaped the massacre of Paris, made head against the royal forces in Normandy, supported by Queen Elizabeth with arms and money. Being driven from his fortresses in these parts, he retired to a rock called the Tombelaine. This is another similar to Mount Michael; only three quarters of a league from it, and of nearly equal dimensions. At that time there was a castle upon it, which has since been demolished, and of which scarce any vestiges now remain. From this fortress, accessible only at low-water, he continually made excursions, and annoyed the enemy, who never dared to attack him. He coined money, laid all the adjacent country under contribution, and rendered himself universally dreaded. Defeated, however, to surprise Mount Michael, he found means to engage one of the monks resident in the abbey; who promised to give him the signal for his enterprise by displaying a handkerchief. The monk having made the signal, betrayed him, and armed all his associates, who waited Montgomery's arrival. The chief came, attended by 50 chosen soldiers, all desperate, and capable of any attempt. They crossed the sand; and having placed their scaling-ladders, mounted one by one. As they came to the top, they were despatched, each in turn, without noise. Montgomery, who followed last, discovered the perfidy, and escaped with only two of his men, with whom he regained the Tombelaine. They preserve with great care the ladders and grappling irons used on this occasion. The count was at last besieged and taken prisoner, by the mar\u00e9chal de Matignon, in 1574, at Domfront, in Normandy; and Catharine de Medicis, who hated him for having been, though innocently, the cause of her husband's death, caused him to be immediately executed.\n\nThe church of Mount Michael is a great curiosity. It stands on nine pillars of most enormous dimensions, built on the solid rock. Each of them appears to be about 25 feet in circumference: besides these, there are two others much inferior in size, on which the centre of the church rests, and over which is the tower. The following is the legendary account of the origin of this church: In the reign of Childbert II., there was a bishop of Avranches named St Aubert. To this holy man the archangel Michael was pleased to appear one night, and ordered him to go to this rock to build a church. St Aubert treated this as a dream; upon which the angel appeared a second time; and being still disobeyed, he returned a third time, when, by way of imprinting his command upon the saint's memory, he made a hole in his skull, by touching it with his thumb. The skull is still preserved in the treasury of the church. It is enclosed in a little shrine of gold, and a crystal, which opens over the orifice, admits the gratification of curiosity by the minute examination of it. The hole is of a size and shape proportionable to the thumb said to have produced it; but it is impossible to determine whether it has been really made by a knife or any other way. It is not to be supposed that the saint would forget such a sensible mark of the angel's displeasure; he therefore immediately repaired to the rock, and constructed a small church, as he had been commanded. Here, however, true history supplies the place of fable; and informs us, that it was in 966 when Richard the second duke of Normandy began to build the abbey. It was completed about the year 1070, under William the Conqueror, though many other additions were made by succeeding abbots.\n\nIn the treasury of the church are innumerable other relics: among which some few have a real and intrinsic value. There is a fine head of Charles VI. of France, cut in a crystal, and the representation of a cockleshell in gold, weighing many pounds, given by Richard II. duke of Normandy, when he founded the abbey. There is an arm said to belong to St Richard king of England; but who this saint was it must be very difficult to determine. Such is the history of the priory, abbey, and church of Mount Michael previous to the revolution; they have probably undergone some changes since that period.\n\nSt MICHAEL'S, a borough town of Cornwall, between St Columb and Truro, 247 miles from London. Though one of the oldest boroughs in the county by prescription, and of great note in the Saxon times, it is a mean hamlet in the parishes of Newland and St Enidore; yet it is governed by a porreeve, chosen yearly by a jury of the chief inhabitants, out of the six chief tenants, called deputy lords of the manor, because they hold lands in the borough. Here is\nMichaelis, is no market, but two fairs. A court-leet is held here twice a year. This place was formerly called Modif-hole, and afterwards Michael. Its list of members begins in the 6th of Edward VI.\n\nSt Michael's Mount, in the county of Cornwall, in the corner of Mount's Bay, is a very high rock, only divided by the tide from the main land, so that it is land and island twice a day. The town here was burnt by the French in the reign of King Henry VIII. At the bottom of this mount, in digging for tin, there have been found spear heads, battle axes, and swords, of brass, all wrapped up in linen. The county is contracted here into a sort of isthmus, so that it is scarcely four miles between the Channel and the Severn sea.\u2014Large trees have been driven in by the sea between this mount and Penzance.","sp":397,"ep":399},{"h":"MICHAELIS","t":"JOHN DAVID, a celebrated biblical critic, and author of many esteemed works, was the eldest son of Dr Christian Benedict Michaelis, professor in the university of Halle in Lower Saxony, and was born at that place, Feb. 27, 1717. His father devoted him at an early age to an academical life; and with that view he received the first part of his education in a celebrated Prussian seminary, called the Orphan house, at Glanche, in the neighbourhood of his native place. He commenced his academical career at Halle in 1733, and took his master's degree in the faculty of philosophy in 1739. In 1741 he made an excursion to this country, where his superior knowledge of the oriental languages, which was considerably increased by his indefatigable researches in the Bodleian library at Oxford, introduced him to the acquaintance, and gained him the esteem, of our first literary characters; with several of whom, and particularly Bishop Lowth, he was in correspondence for many years. On his return to Halle, after an absence of fifteen months, he began to read lectures on the historical books of the Old Testament, which he continued after his removal to Gottingen in 1745. In 1746 he was appointed professor extraordinary, and soon after professor of philosophy, in that university. The next year he obtained a place of secretary to the Royal Society there, of which he was director in 1761, and was soon afterwards made aulic counsellor by the court of Hanover. In 1764 his distinguished talents, but chiefly a publication relative to a journey to Arabia, which was undertaken by several literary men, at the expense of the king of Denmark, in consequence of his application by means of Count Bernstorff, procured him the honour of being chosen a correspondent, and afterwards foreign member, of the Academy of Inscriptions at Paris, of whom the institution admitted only eight; and in the same year he became a member of the society of Haarlem. In 1775, Count Hopkin, who eighteen years before had prohibited the use of his writings at Upsal, when he was chancellor of that university, prevailed upon the king of Sweden to confer on him the order of the Polar Star, as a national compensation. In 1786 he was raised to the distinguished rank of privy counsellor of justice by the court of Hanover; and in 1788 received his last literary honour, by being unanimously elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London.\u2014His great critical knowledge of the Hebrew language, which he displayed in a new translation of the Bible, and in other works, raised him to a degree of eminence almost unknown before in Germany; and his indefatigable labours were only equalled by his desire of communicating the knowledge he acquired to the numerous students of all countries who frequented his admirable lectures, which he continued to deliver on various parts of the sacred writings in half-yearly courses, and on the Hebrew, Arabic, and Syriac languages, to the last year of his life. He was professor in the university of Gottingen 45 years, and, during that long period, he filled the chair with dignity, credit, and usefulness. He died October 22, 1791, aged 74. He is said to have left behind him several valuable MSS. Of the works that were published during his lifetime, and which are very numerous, a catalogue, in the order of their publication, is given in the Gentleman's Magazine for March 1792.","sp":399,"ep":399},{"h":"MICHAELMAS","t":"or Feast of St Michael and all Angels, a festival of the Christian church, observed on the 29th of September.

This gentleman having resided a few years in London, was presented to the church of Langholm in Scotland, where he married; and our author was one of the younger sons. He was born about the year 1735, and was educated by his father. In his early years his passion for poetry frequently discovered itself; though till the age of 13 he did not show any particular attachment to books. At that time having accidentally met with Spencer's Faery Queen, he became enamoured of his manner of writing, and instantly began to imitate him. After the death of his father, he came to Edinburgh to reside with an uncle who was a brewer there, and who admitted him into a share of his business; not being qualified to succeed in this line, he went to London about the time of the conclusion of the war which began in 1755, with a view to procure a commission in the marine service. Here he was disappointed; but introduced himself to the first Lord Lyttelton, to whom he sent one of his poems. From his Lordship, however, he received no other favour than being admitted to several interviews, and encouraged to persevere in his poetical plans.\n\nSo closely did our author cultivate the study of the muses, that before he was 18 years of age he had written two tragedies and half an epic poem; but all these were committed to the flames. The first of his poems which appeared in print was published in one of the Edinburgh magazines, and entitled, \"On passing through the Parliament Cloak of Edinburgh at Midnight.\" This was afterwards inserted in A Collection of Original Poems by a Scotch gentleman, vol. ii. p. 137.\n\nFrom the time of Mr Mickle's arrival in London till the year 1765, it is not known how he employed his time, though it is probable that he was employed in some branch of the printing business; and in 1765 he engaged himself as corrector to the Clarendon press. This year he published the poem which first brought him into notice, entitled, \"Pollio, an Elegiac Ode,\" written in the Wood near R\u2014\u2014 (Rollin) Castle,\"\nThis was an elegy written on the death of his brother; which, previous to its publication, had been shown to Lord Lyttelton, and received some corrections from him. The latter, in an epistle to the author, spoke of it as equal to any thing of the kind in our language. In 1767 he published a poem called \"The Concubine, in two cantos, after the manner of Spencer,\" 4to; and in 1769 he published, \"A Letter to Mr Harwood, wherein some of his evasive gloffes, false translations, and blundering criticisms, in support of the Arian Heresy, contained in his literal translation of the New Testament, are pointed out and confuted,\" 8vo: and next year he published \"Mary Queen of Scots, an Elegy;\" \"Hengist and Mary, a Ballad;\" and \"Knowledge, an Ode;\" in Peach's Collection of Poems. In 1770 he published \"Voltaire in the Shades, or Dialogues on the Deistical Controversy,\" 8vo. The Elegy on Mary had been submitted to the judgement of Lord Lyttelton, who declined to criticise it, not for its deficiency in poetical merit, but from thinking differently from the author concerning that unfortunate princess.\n\nAbout this time Mr Mickle was a frequent writer in the Whitehall Evening Post; but a more important work now engaged his attention. When no more than 17 years of age he had read Caffara's translation of the Lusiad of Camoens into French, and then projected the design of giving an English translation of it. From this, however, he was prevented by various avocations till the year 1771, when he published the first book as a specimen: and having prepared himself by acquiring some knowledge of the Portuguese language, he determined to apply himself entirely to this work. With this view he quitted his residence at Oxford, and went to a farm house at Forest-hill, where he pursued his design with unremitting assiduity till the year 1775, when the work was entirely finished.\n\nDuring the time that Mr Mickle was engaged in this work, he subsisted entirely by his employment as corrector of the press; and on his quitting that employment he had only the subscriptions he received for his translation to support him. Notwithstanding these difficulties, he adhered steadily to the plan he had laid down, and completed it in about five years.\n\nWhen his work was finished, Mr Mickle applied to a person of great rank, with whom his family had been connected, for permission to dedicate it to him. Permission was granted, and his patron honoured him with a very polite letter; but after receiving a copy, for which an extraordinary price was paid for the binding, he did not think proper to take any notice of the author. At last a gentleman of high rank in the political world, a firm friend to the author, and who afterwards took him under his protection, waited on the patron, and heard him declare that he had not read the work, but that it had been represented not to have the merit it was at first said to possess. The applause with which the work was received, however, soon banished from the author's mind those disagreeable sensations which had been occasioned by the contemptuous neglect of his patron, as well as some severe criticisms which had been circulated concerning it. A second edition was prepared in 1773, with a plate prefixed to it, executed by the celebrated artist Mortimer; on whom Mr Mickle wrote an epitaph in 1779. This year also he published a pamphlet, entitled, \"A Candid Examination of the Reasons for depriving the East India Company of its Charter, contained in The History and Management of the East India Company from its Commencement to the Present Time; together with some Strictures on the Self-Contradictions and Historical Errors of Dr Adam Smith, in his Reasons for the Abolition of the said Company,\" 4to. About this time some of his friends thought of recommending him to the king as deserving of a pension; but this scheme was never put into execution. Dr Lowth bishop of London, would have put him into orders, and provided for him in the church; but this was not agreeable to our author's disposition. While he was meditating a publication of all his poems, in which he would most probably have found his account, he was appointed secretary to Commodore Johnstone, who had lately obtained the command of the Romney man of war. In November 1779 he arrived at Lisbon, and was named by his patron joint agent for the prizes which were taken. In this capital and its neighbourhood he resided more than six months, being everywhere received with every mark of politeness and attention; and during this period he composed his poem called \"Almada Hill,\" which in 1781 was published in quarto. He collected also many particulars concerning the manners of the Portuguese, which he intended also to have published. During his stay at Lisbon the Royal Academy was opened; and Mr Mickle, who was present at the ceremony of its commencement, had the honour to be admitted a member under the presidency of Don John of Braganza, duke of Laf\u00f5es. His presence being thought necessary in England to attend to the proceedings of the courts of law respecting the condemnation of some of the prizes, he did not accompany the Commodore in his last expedition, nor did he go any more to sea. In 1782 he published \"The Prophecy of Queen Emma, an ancient Ballad lately discovered, written by Johannes Turgotus, prior of Durham, in the reign of William Rufus; to which is added by the Editor, an Account of the Discovery, and Hints towards a Vindication of the Authenticity, of the Poems of Offian and Rowley,\" 8vo.\n\nIn June this year Mr Mickle married Miss Tomkins, daughter of the person with whom he resided at Forest-hill, while engaged in translating the Lusiad. Having received some fortune with this lady, as well as made some money himself when in the service of Commodore Johnstone, he now enjoyed a comfortable independence. He afterwards fixed his residence at Wheatley in Oxfordshire, and devoted his time to the revision of his poetical works, which he proposed to publish by subscription. During the last seven years of his life he was employed in writing for the European Magazine. The Fragments of Leo, and some of the most approved reviews of books, in that periodical work, were of his production. He died after a short illness, on the 25th of October 1788, at Wheatley, leaving one son behind him. His poetry possesses much beauty, variety, harmony of numbers, and vigour of imagination:","sp":399,"ep":400},{"h":"MICROCOSM","t":"a Greek term signifying the little world; used by some for man, as being supposed an epitome of the universe or great world.","sp":400,"ep":401},{"h":"MICROGRAPHY","t":"the description of objects viewed with the assistance of a microscope.

The first TELESCOPIC micrometers were only mechanical contrivances for measuring the image of an object in the focus of the object-glass. Before these contrivances were thought of, astronomers were accustomed to measure the field of view in each of their telescopes, by observing how much of the moon they could see through it, the semidiameter being reckoned at 15 or 16 minutes; and other distances were estimated by the eye, comparing them with the field of view. Mr Galcogne, an English gentleman, however, fell upon a much more accurate method before the year 1641, and had a Treatise on Optics prepared for the press; but he was killed during the civil wars in the service of Charles I., and his manuscript was never found. His instrument, however, fell into the hands of Mr R. Townly*, who says, that by the help of it he could mark above 40,000 divisions in a foot.\n\n2. Mr Galcogne's instrument being shown to Dr Hooke, he gave a drawing and description of it, and proposed several improvements\u2020. Mr Galcogne divided the image of an object in the focus of the object glass, by the approach of two pieces of metal ground to a very fine edge, in the place of which Dr Hooke would substitute two fine hairs stretched parallel to one another.\n\n3. Mr Huygens measured the apparent diameters of the planets, by first determining the quantity of the field of view in his telescope; which, he says, is best done by observing the time that a star takes up in passing over it, and then preparing two or three long and slender brass plates, of various breadths, the sides of which are very straight, and converging to a small angle. In using these pieces of brass, he made them slide in two slots, made in the sides of the tube, opposite to the place of the image, and observed in what place it just covered the diameter of any planet, or any small distance that he wanted to measure\u2021. It was observed, however, by Sir Isaac Newton, that the diameters of planets, measured in this manner, will be larger than they should be, as all lucid objects appear to be when they are viewed upon dark ones.\n\n4. In the Ephemerides of the Marquis of Malvasia, published in 1662, it appears that he had a method of measuring small distances between fixed stars and the diameters of the planets, and also of taking accurate draughts of the spots of the moon by a net of silver wire, fixed in the focus of the eye-glass. He likewise contrived to make one of two stars pass along the threads of this net, by turning it, or the telescope, as much as was necessary for that purpose; and he counted, by a pendulum-clock, beating seconds, the time that elapsed in its passage from one wire to another, which gave him the number of minutes and seconds of a degree contained between the intervals of the Micrometer wires of his net, with respect to the focal length of his telescope.\n\n5. In 1666, Messrs Auzout and Picard published a description of a micrometer, which was nearly the same micrometer with that of the Marquis of Malvasia, excepting the method of dividing it, which they performed with more exactness by a screw. In some cases they used threads of silk, as being finer than silver wires. Dechales also recommends a micrometer consisting of fine wires, or silk threads, the distances of which were exactly known, disposed in the form of a net, as peculiarly convenient for taking a map of the moon.\n\n6. M. de la Hire says, that there is no method more simple or commodious for observing the digits of an micrometric eclipse than a net in the focus of the telescope. These, he says, were generally made of silk threads; and that for this particular purpose six concentric circles had also been made use of, drawn upon oiled paper; but he advises to draw the circles on very thin pieces of glass with the point of a diamond. He also gives several particular directions to assist persons in the use of them.\n\n7. Construction of Different Micrometers. The first we shall describe is the common micrometer. Let ABCD micrometer be the focus of the telescope at the principal focus of the object-glass, or where the wires are situated, which are placed in a short tube containing the eye-glass, and may be turned into any position by turning that tube; m n is a fine wire extended over its centre; v w, x y, are two parallel wires well fixed, and perpendicular to m n; v w is fixed, and x y moves parallel to it by means of a screw, which carries two indexes over a graduated plate, to show the number of revolutions and parts of a revolution which it makes. Now to measure any angle, we must first ascertain the number of revolutions and parts of a revolution corresponding to some known angle, which may be thus done: 1st, Bring the inner edges of the wires exactly to coincide, and set each index to 0; turn the screw, and separate the wires to any distance; and observe the time a star m is in passing along the wire m n from one vertical wire to the other: for that time, turned into minutes and seconds of a degree, will be the angle answering to the number of revolutions, or the angle corresponding to the distance. Thus, if d = col. of the star's declination, we have \\( \\frac{d}{m} \\) dm, the angle corresponding to this distance; and hence, by proportion, we find the angle answering to any other. 2ndly, Set up an object of a known diameter, or two objects at a given distance, and turn the screw till the vertical wires become tangents to the object, or till their opening just takes in the distance of the two objects upon the wire m n; then from the diameter, or distance of the two objects from each other, and their distance from the glass, calculate the angle, and observe the number of revolutions and parts corresponding. 3rdly, Take the diameter of the sun on any day, by making the wires tangents to the opposite limbs, and find, from the nautical almanac, his diameter on that day. Here it will be best to take the upper and lower limbs of the sun when on the meridian, as he has then no motion perpendicular to the horizon. If the edges do not coincide when the indexes stand at 0, we must allow for the error. Instead of making a proportion, it is better to have a table calculated to show the angle correspond-\ning to every revolution and parts of a revolution. But the observer must remember, that when the micrometer is fixed to telescopes of different focal lengths, a new table must be made. The whole system of wires is turned about in its own plane, by turning the eye-tube round with the hand, and by that means the wire can be thrown into any position, and consequently angles in any position may be measured. Dr Bradley added a small motion by a rack and pinion to set the wires more accurately in any position.\n\n8. But the micrometer, as now contrived, is of use, not only to find the angular distance of bodies in the field of view at the same time, but also of those which, when the telescope is fixed, pass through the field of view successively; by which means we can find the difference of their right ascensions and declinations.\n\nLet Aa, Bb, Cc, be three parallel and equidistant wires, the middle one bisecting the field of view; HOR a fixed wire perpendicular to them passing through the centre of the field; and Ff, Gg, two wires parallel to it, each moveable by a micrometer screw, as before, so that they can be brought up to HOR, or a little beyond. Then to find the angular distance of two objects, bring them very near to Bb, and in a line parallel to it, by turning about the wires, and bring one upon HOR, and by the micrometer screw make Ff or Gg pass through the other; then turn the screw till that wire coincides with HOR, and the arc which the index has passed over shows their angular distance. If the objects be further remote than you can carry the distance of one of the wires Ff, Gg from HOR, then bring one object to Ff and the other to Gg; and turn each micrometer screw till they meet, and the sum of the arcs passed over by each index gives their angular distance. If the objects be two stars, and one of them be made to run along HOR, or either of the moveable wires as occasion may require, the motion of the other will be parallel to these wires, and their difference of declinations may be observed with great exactness; but in taking any other distances, the motion of the stars being oblique to them, it is not quite so easy to get them parallel to Bb; because if one star be brought near, and the eye be applied to the other to adjust the wires to it, the former star will have gotten a little away from the wire. Dr Bradley, in his account of the use of this micrometer, published by Dr Maskelyne in the Philosophical Transactions for 1772, thinks the best way is to move the eye backwards and forwards as quick as possible; but it seems to be best to fix the eye at some point between, by which means it takes in both at once sufficiently well defined to compare them with Bb. In finding the difference of declinations, if both bodies do not come into the field of view at the same time, make one run along the wire HOR, as before, and fix the telescope and wait till the other comes in, and then adjust one of the moveable wires to it, and bring it up to HOR, and the index gives the difference of their declinations. The difference of time between the passage of the star at either of the cross moveable wires, and the transit of the other star over the cross fixed wire (which represents a meridian), turned into degrees and minutes, will give the difference of right ascension. The star has been here supposed to be biflected by the wire; but if the wire be a tangent to it, allowance must be made for the breadth of the wire, provided the adjustment be made for the coincidence of the wires. In observing the diameters of the sun, moon, or planets, it may perhaps be most convenient to make use of the outer edges of the wires, because they appear most distinct when quite within the limb; but if there should be any sensible inflection of the rays of light in passing by the wires, it will be best avoided by using the inner edge of one wire and the outward edge of the other; for by that means the inflection at both limbs will be the same way, and therefore there will be no alteration of the relative position of the rays passing by each wire. And it will be convenient in the micrometer to note at what division the index stands when the moveable wire coincides with HOR; for then you need not bring the wire when a star is upon it up to HOR, only reckon from the division at which the index then stands to the above division.\n\n9. With a micrometer thus adapted to a telescope, Mr Savery of Exeter proposed a new way of measuring the difference between the greatest and least apparent diameters of the sun, although the whole of the sun's disk was not visible in the field of view at once. The method we shall briefly describe. Place two object-glasses instead of one, so as to form two images whose limbs shall be at a small distance from each other; or instead of two perfect lenses, he proposed to cut a single lens into four parts of equal breadths by parallel lines, and to place the two segments with their straight sides against each other, or the two middle frustums with their opposite edges together; in either case, the two parts which before had a common centre and axis, have now their centres and axes separated, and consequently two images will be formed as before by two perfect lenses. Another method in reflectors was to cut the large concave reflector through the centre, and by a contrivance to turn up the outer edges whilst the straight ones remained fixed; by which means the axis of the two parts became inclined, and formed two images. Two images being formed in this manner, he proposed to measure the distance between the limbs when the diameters of the sun were the greatest and least, the difference of which would be the difference of the diameters required. Thus far we are indebted to Mr Savery for the idea of forming two images; and the admirable uses to which it was afterwards applied, we shall next proceed to describe.\n\n10. The divided object-glass micrometer, as now made, was contrived by the late Mr John Dollond, and by Mr John him adapted to the object-end of a reflecting telescope, Dollond, and has been since by the present Mr P. Dollond his son applied with equal advantage to the end of an achromatic telescope. The principle is this: The object-glass is divided into two segments in a line drawn through the centre; each segment is fixed in a separate frame of brass, which is moveable, so that the centres of the two segments may be brought together by a handle for that purpose, and thereby form one image of an object; but when separated they will form two images, lying in a line passing through the centre of each segment; and consequently the motion of each image will be parallel to that line, which can be thrown into any position by the contrivance of another handle to turn...\nturn the glass about in its own plane. The brass-work carries a vernier to measure the distance of the centres of the two segments. Now let E, and H be the centres of the two segments, F their principal focus, and PQ two distant objects in FE, FH, produced, or the opposite limbs of the same object PBQD; then the images of P and Q, formed by each segment, or the images of the opposite limbs of the object PBQD, coincide at F: hence two images m = F, n = F of that object are formed, whose limbs are in contact; therefore the angular distance of the points P and Q is the same as the angle which the distance EH subtends at F, which, as the angles supposed to be measured are very small, will vary as EH extremely nearly; and consequently if the angle corresponding to one interval of the centres of the segments be known, the angle corresponding to any other will be found by proportion. Now to find the interval for some one angle, take the horizontal diameter of the sun on any day, by separating the images till the contrary limbs coincide, and read off by the vernier the interval of their centres, and look into the nautical almanac for the diameter of the sun on that day, and you have the corresponding angle. Or if greater exactness be required than from taking the angle in proportion to the distances of their centres, we may proceed thus:\u2014Draw FG perpendicular to EH, which therefore bisects it; then one half EH, or EG, is the tangent of half the angle EFH; hence, half the distance of their centres is to the tangent of half the angle corresponding to that distance as half any other distance of the centres is to the tangent of half the corresponding angle (A).\n\n11. From this the method of measuring small angles is manifest; for we consider P, Q either as two objects whose images are brought together by separating the two segments, or as the opposite limbs of one object PBQA, whose images, formed by the two segments E, H, touch at F; in the former case, EH gives the angular distance of the two objects; and in the latter, it gives the angle under which the diameter of the object appears. In order to find the angular distance of two objects, therefore, separate the segments till the two images which approach each other coincide; and to find the diameter of an object, separate the segments till the contrary limbs of the images touch each other, and read off the distance of the centres of the segment from the vernier (B), and find the angle as directed in the last article. Hence appears Micrometer's one great superiority in this above the wire micrometer; as, with the one any diameter of an object may be measured with the same ease and accuracy; whereas with the other we cannot with accuracy measure any diameter, except that which is at right angles to the direction of motion.\n\n12. But, besides these two uses to which the instrument seems so well adapted, Dr Malkeleyne* has shown, how it may be applied to find the difference of right ascensions and declinations. For this purpose, two wires at right angles to each other, bifurcating the field of view, must be placed in the principal focus of the eye-glass, and moveable about in their own plane.\u2014Let HCR be the field of view, HR and Cc the two wires; turn the wires till the westernmost star (which is the best, having further to move) run along ROH; Fig. 4, then separate the two segments, and turn about the micrometer till the two images of the same star lie in the wire Cc; and then, partly by separating the segments, and partly by raising or depressing the telescope, bring the two innermost images of the two stars to appear and run along ROH, as a, b, and the vernier will give the difference of their declinations; because, as the two images of one of the stars coincided with Cc, the image of each star was brought perpendicularly upon HR, or to HR in their proper meridian. And, for the same reason, the difference of their times of passing the wire COc will give their difference of right ascensions. These operations will be facilitated, if the telescope be mounted on a polar axis.* If two other wires KL, MN, parallel to Cc, be placed near H and R, the observation may be made on two stars whose difference of meridians is nearly equal to HR the diameter of the field of view, by bringing the two images of one of the stars to coincide with one of these wires. If two stars be observed whose difference of declinations is well settled, the scale of the micrometer will be known.\n\n13. It has hitherto been supposed, that the images of the two stars can be both brought into the field of view at once upon the wire HOR; but if they cannot, let the micrometer to the difference of their declinations as nearly as you can, and make the image which comes first run along the wire HOR, by elevating or depressing the telescope; and when the other star comes in, if it do not also run along HOR, alter\n\n---\n\n(A) If the object is not distant let f be the principal focus; then Ff : FG :: FG : FK (FG being produced to meet a line joining the apparent places of the two objects P, Q,), \u2234 dividendo, fG : FG :: GK : FK, and alternando, fG : GK :: FG : FK :: (by similar triangles) EH : PQ, hence EH = PQ, therefore the angle subtended by EH at f = the angle subtended by PQ at G; and consequently, as fG is constant, the angle measured at G is, in this case, also proportional to EH. The instrument is not adapted to measure the angular distance of bodies, one of which is near and the other at a distance, because their images would not be formed together.\n\n(B) To determine if there be any error in the adjustment of the micrometer scale, measure the diameter of any small well-defined object, as Jupiter's equatorial diameter, or the longest axis of Saturn's ring, both ways, that is, with o on the vernier to the right and left of o on the scale, and half the difference is the error required. This error must be added to or subtracted from all observations, according as the diameter measured with o on the vernier, when advanced on the scale, is less or greater than the diameter measured the other way. And it is also evident, that half the sum of the diameters thus measured gives the true diameter of the object.\nthe micrometer till it does, and half the sum of the numbers shown by the micrometer at the two separate observations of the two flares on the wire HOR will be the difference of their declinations. That this should be true, it is manifestly necessary that the two segments should recede equally in opposite directions; and this is effected by Mr Dollond in his new improvement of the object-glass micrometer.\n\n14. The difference of right ascensions and declinations of Venus or Mercury in the sun's disk and the sun's limb may be thus found. Turn the wires so that the north limb n of the sun's image AB, or the north limb of the image V of the planet, may run along the wire RH, which therefore will then be parallel to the equator, and consequently Cc a secondary to it; then separate the segments, and turn about the micrometer till the two images Vv of the planet pass Cc at the same time, and then by separating the segments, bring the north limb of the northernmost image V of the planet to touch HR, at the time the northernmost limb n of the southernmost image AB of the sun touches it, and the micrometer shows the difference of declinations of the northernmost limbs of the planet and sun, for the reason formerly given (Art. 11.) having brought the northernmost limbs of the two innermost images V and AB to HR, these two being manifestly interior to v and the northernmost limb N of the image PQ. In the same manner we take the difference of declinations of their southernmost limbs; and half the difference of the two measures (taking immediately one after another) is equal to the difference of the declinations of their centres, without any regard to the sun's or planet's diameters, or error of adjustment of the micrometer; for as it affects both equally, the difference is the same as if there were no error; and the difference of the times of the transits of the eastern or western limbs of the sun and planet over Cc gives the difference of their right ascensions.\n\n15. Instead of the difference of right ascensions, the distance of the planet from the sun's limb, in lines parallel to the equator, may be more accurately observed thus: Separate the segments, and turn about the wires and micrometer, so as to make both images V, v, run along HR, or so that the two intersections I, T of the sun's image may pass Cc at the same time. Then bring the planet's and sun's limbs into contact, as at V, and do the same for the other limb of the sun, and half the difference gives the distance of the centre of the planet from the middle of the chord on the sun's disk parallel to the equator, or the difference of the right ascensions of their centres, allowing for the motion of the planet in the interval of the observations, without any regard to the error of adjustment, for the same reason as before. For if you take any point in the chord of a circle, half the\n\n(c) For if the eye can see distinctly an image at F, the pencils of rays, of which PF, QF are the two axes, diverging from F, are each brought to a focus on the retina at the same point; and therefore the two limbs appear to coincide: but if we increase the refractive power of the eye, then each pencil is brought to a focus, and they cross each other before the rays come to the retina, consequently the two limbs on the retina will lap over; and if we diminish the refractive power of the eye, then each pencil being brought to a focus beyond the retina, and not crossing till after they have passed it, the two limbs on the retina must be separated.\nMicrometer R by the prism PR, may proceed in the direction RQ; and as all the rays which were proceeding to a suffer the same refraction at the prism, they will all be refracted to Q; and therefore, instead of an image ab, which would have been formed by the lens alone, an image Oc is formed by those rays which fall on the prism PR; and for the same reason, the rays falling on the prism SR will form an image Qd: and in fig. 9, the image of the point b is brought to Q, by the prism PR, and consequently an image Qd is formed by those rays which fall on PR: and for the same reason, an image Oc is formed by the rays falling on SR.\n\nNow in both cases, as the rays EFR, WGR, coming from the two opposite limbs of the sun, and forming the point of contact of the two limbs, proceed in the same direction RQ, they must thus accompany each other through the eye-glass and also through the eye, whatever refractive power it has, and therefore to every eye the images must appear to touch. Now the angle aRb is twice the refraction of the prism, and the angle aCb is the diameter of the sun; and as these angles are very small, and have the same subtense ab, we have the angle aRb : angle aCb :: CQ : RQ.\n\nNow as CQ is constant, and also the angle aRb being twice the refraction of the prism, the angle aCa varies as RQ. Hence the extent of the scale for measuring angles becomes the focal length of the object-glass, and the angle measured is in proportion to the distance of the prisms from the principal focus of the object-glass; and the micrometer can measure all angles (very small ones excepted, for the reason given in Art. 19.) which do not exceed the sum of the refractions of the prisms; for the angle aCb, the diameter of the object to be measured, is always larger than the angle aRb, the sum of the refractions of the prisms, except when the prisms touch the object glass, and then they become equal. The scale can never be out of adjustment, as the point o, where the measurement begins, answers to the focus of the object-glass, which is a fixed point for all distant objects, and we have only to find the value of the scale answering to some known angle: for instance, bring the two limbs of the sun's images into contact, and measure the distance of the prisms from the focus, and look in the nautical almanac for the sun's diameter, and you get the value of the scale.\n\nIn fig. 8, the limb Q of the image Oc, is illuminated by the rays falling on the object glass between A and F, and of the image Qd by those falling between B and G; but in fig. 9, the same limbs are illuminated by the rays falling between B and F, A and G respectively, and therefore will be more illuminated than in the other case; but the difference is not considerable in achromatic telescopes, on account of the great aperture of the object glass compared with the distance FG.\n\nIt might be convenient to have two sets of prisms, one for measuring angles not exceeding 30', and therefore fit for measuring the diameters of the sun and moon, and the lucid parts and distances of the cusps in their eclipses; and another for measuring angles not much greater than 1', for the convenience of measuring the diameters of the planets. For as QC : QR :: sum of the refractions of the prisms : angle aCb, the apparent diameter of the object, it is evident that if you diminish the third term, you must increase the second in the same ratio, in order to measure the same Micrometer; and thus by diminishing the refractive angle of the prisms, you throw them further from Q, and consequently avoid the inconvenience of bringing them near to Q, for the reason in the next paragraph; and at the same time you will increase the illumination in a small degree. The prisms must be achromatic, each composed of two prisms of flint and crown glass, placed with their refracting angles in contrary directions, otherwise the images will be coloured.\n\nIn the construction here described, the angle measured becomes evanescent when the prisms come to the principal focus of the object-glass, and therefore o on the scale then begins: but if the prisms be placed in the principal focus they can have no effect, because the pencil of rays at the junction of the prisms would then vanish, and therefore it is not practicable to bring the two images together to get o on the scale. Dr. Maskelyne, therefore, thought of placing another pair of prisms within, to refract the rays before they came to the other prisms, by which means the two images would be formed into one before they came to the principal focus, and therefore o on the scale could be determined. But to avoid the error arising from the multiplication of mediums, he, instead of adding another pair of prisms, divided the object-glass through its centre, and sliding the segments a little it separated the images, and then by the prisms he could form one image very distinctly, and consequently could determine o on the scale; for by separating the two segments you form two images, and you will separate the two pencils so that you may move up the two prisms, and the two pencils will fall on each respectively, and the two images may be formed into one. In the instrument which Dr. Maskelyne had made, o on the scale was chosen to be about 3' of the focal length of the object-glass, and each prism refracted 27'. By this means all angles are measured down to o.\n\nIn the Philosophical Transactions for 1779, Mr. Ramsden has described two new micrometers, which he contrived with a view of remedying the defects of the object-glass micrometer.\n\nOne of these is a catoptric micrometer, which, beside the advantage it derives from the principle of reflecting reflection, of not being disturbed by the heterogeneity micrometer of light, avoids every defect of other micrometers, and can have no aberration, nor any defect arising from the imperfection of materials or of execution; as the extreme simplicity of its construction requires no additional mirrors or glasses to those required for the telescope; and the separation of the images being effected by the inclination of the two specula, and not depending on the focus of any lens or mirror, any alteration in the eye of an observer cannot affect the angle measured. It has peculiar to itself the advantages of an adjustment, to make the images coincide in a direction perpendicular to that of their motion; and also of measuring the diameter of a planet on both sides of the zero, which will appear no inconsiderable advantage to observers who know how much easier it is to ascertain the contact of the external edges of two images than their perfect coincidence.\n\nA represents the final speculum divided into two equal parts; one of which is fixed on the end of the arm B; the other end of the arm is fixed on a steel axis.\nMicrometer X, which crosses the end of the telescope C. The other half of the mirror A is fixed on the arm D, which arm at the other end terminates in a socket g; that turns on the axis X; both arms are prevented from bending by the braces a a. G represents a double screw, having one part e cut into double the number of threads in an inch to that of the part g; the part e having 100 threads in one inch, and the part g 50 only. The screw e works in a nut F in the side of the telescope, while the part g turns in a nut H, which is attached to the arm B; the ends of the arms B and D, to which the mirrors are fixed, are separated from each other by the point of the double screw pressing against the fluid h, fixed to the arm D, and turning in the nut H on the arm B. The two arms B and D are pressed against the direction of the double screw e g by a spiral spring within the part n, by which means all shake or play in the nut H, on which the measure depends, is entirely prevented.\n\nFrom the difference of the threads on the screw at e and g, it is evident, that the progressive motion of the screw through the nut will be half the distance of the separation of the two halves of the mirror; and consequently the half mirrors will be moved equally in contrary directions from the axis of the telescope C.\n\n23. The wheel V fixed on the end of the double screw has its circumference divided into 100 equal parts, and numbered at every fifth division with 5, 10, &c., to 100, and the index I shows the motion of the screw with the wheel round its axis, while the number of revolutions of the screw is shown by the divisions on the same index. The steel screw at R may be turned by the key S, and serves to incline the small mirror at right angles to the direction of its motion. By turning the finger-head T, the eye tube P is brought nearer or farther from the small mirror, to adjust the telescope to distinct vision; and the telescope itself hath a motion round its axis for the convenience of measuring the diameter of a planet in any direction. The inclination of the diameter measured with the horizon is shown in degrees and minutes by a level and vernier on a graduated circle, at the breech of the telescope.\n\n24. Besides the table for reducing the revolutions and parts of the screw to minutes, seconds, &c., it will require a table for correcting a small error which arises from the eccentric motion of the half-mirrors. By this motion their centres of curvature will approach a little towards the large mirror: the equation for this purpose in small angles is infinibl; but when angles to be measured exceed ten minutes, it should not be neglected. Or, the angle measured may be corrected by diminishing it in the proportion the verified sine of the angle measured, supposing the eccentricity radius, bears to the focal length of the small mirror.\n\n25. Mr Ramsden preferred Caflgrain's construction of the reflecting telescope to either the Gregorian or Newtonian; because in the former, the errors of one speculum are corrected by those of the other. From a property of the reflecting telescope, not generally known, that the apertures of the two specula are to each other very nearly in the proportion of their focal lengths, it follows, that their aberrations will be in the same proportion; and these aberrations will be in the same direction, if the two specula are concave; or in contrary directions, if one speculum is concave and the other convex. In the Gregorian telescope, both specula being concave, the aberration at the second image will be the sum of the aberrations of the two mirrors; but in the Caflgrainian telescope one mirror being concave and the other convex, the aberration at the second image will be the difference between the two aberrations. By assuming such proportions for the foci of the specula as are generally used in the reflecting telescope, which is about as 1 to 4, the aberration in the Caflgrainian construction will be to that in the Gregorian as 3 to 5.\n\n26. The other is a dioptric micrometer, or one suited to the principle of refraction. This micrometer is applied to the erect eye-tube of a refracting telescope, and is placed in the conjugate focus of the first eyeglas: in which position, the image being considerably magnified before it comes to the micrometer, any imperfection in its glass will be magnified only by the remaining eye-glasses, which in any telescope seldom exceeds five or six times. By this position also the size of the micrometer glass will not be the $\\frac{1}{\\text{v}}$ part of the area which would be required if it was placed in the object-glas; and, notwithstanding this great disproportion of size, which is of great moment to the practical optician, the same extent of scale is preserved, and the images are uniformly bright in every part of the field of the telescope.\n\n27. Fig. 12. represents the glasses of a reflecting telescope; x y, the principal pencil of rays from the object-glas O; t u and u v, the axis of two oblique pencils; a, the first eye-glas; m, its conjugate focus, or the place of the micrometer; b the second eye-glas; c the third; and d the fourth, or that which is nearest the eye. Let p be the diameter of the object-glas, e the diameter of a pencil at m, and f the diameter of the pencil at the eye; it is evident, that the axes of the pencils from every part of the image will cross each other at the point m; and e, the width of the micrometer-glas, is to p the diameter of the object-glas, as m a is to g o, which is the proportion of the magnifying power at the point m; and the error caused by an imperfection in the micrometer glass placed at m will be to the error, had the micrometer been at O, as m is to p.\n\n28. Fig. 13. represents the micrometer; A, a convex lens bisected by a plane across its centre; one of these semi-lenses is fixed in a frame B, and the other in the frame E; which two frames slide on a plate H, and are pressed against it by thin plates a a: the frames B and E are moved in contrary directions by turning the button D: L is a scale of equal parts on the frame B; it is numbered from each end towards the middle with 10, 20, &c. There are two verniers on the frame E, one at M and the other at N, for the convenience of measuring the diameter of a planet, &c., on both sides the zero. The first division on both these verniers coincides at the same time with the two zeros on the scale, L; and, if the frame is moved towards the right, the relative motion of the two frames is shown on the scale L by the vernier M; but if the frame B be moved towards the left, the relative motion is shown by the vernier N.\u2014This micrometer has a motion round the axis of vision, for the convenience of measuring the diameter of a planet, &c., in any direction, by turning...\ning an endless screw F; and the inclination of the diameter measured with the horizon is shown on the circle g by a vernier on the plate V. The telescope may be adjusted to distinct vision by a screw, which moves the whole eye-tube with the micrometer nearer to or farther from the object-glass, as telescopes are generally made; or the same effect may be produced without moving the micrometer, by sliding the part of the eye tube m on the part n, by help of a screw or pinion.\n\n29. Notwithstanding these improvements on micrometers, they are still liable to many sources of error. The imperfections of the wire micrometer, (which was still the most correct instrument for measuring small angles) when employed to determine the distance of close double stars, have been ably pointed out by Dr. Herschel.\n\n30. When two stars are taken between the parallel wires the diameters must be included. Dr. Herschel has in vain attempted to find lines sufficiently thin to extend them across the centres of the stars so that their thickness might be neglected. The threads of the silk-worm, with such lenses as he uses, are too much magnified that their diameter is more than that of many of the stars. Besides, if they were much smaller, the deflection of light would make the attempt to measure the distance of the centres this way fruitless; for he has always found the light of the stars to play upon those lines and separate their apparent diameters into two parts. Now since the spurious diameters of the stars thus included, are continually changing with the state of the air, and the length of time we look at them, we are, in some respects, left at an uncertainty; and our measures taken at different times, and with different degrees of attention, will vary on that account. Nor can we come at the true distance of the centres of any two stars, unless we know the semidiameters of the stars themselves; for different stars have different apparent diameters, which, with a power of 227, may differ from each other as far as two seconds (D).\n\n31. The next imperfection arises from a deflection of light upon the wires when they approach very near to each other; for if this be owing to a power of repulsion lodged at the surface, it is easy to see that such powers must interfere with each other, and give the measures larger in proportion than they would have been if the repulsive power of one wire had not been opposed by a contrary power of the other wire.\n\n32. Another disadvantage of these micrometers is an uncertainty of the real zero. The least alteration in the situation and quantity of light will affect the zero; and a change in the position of the wires will sometimes produce a difference. To remove this difficulty Dr. Herschel always found his zero while the apparatus preserved the situation which it had when his observations were made; but this introduces an additional observation.\n\n33. The next imperfection, is that every micrometer hitherto used requires either a screw, or a divided bar and pinion, to measure the distance of the wires or the two images. Those acquainted with works of this kind are sensible how difficult it is to have screws perfectly equal in every thread or revolution of each thread; or pinions and bars that shall be so evenly divided as to be depended upon in every leaf and tooth to the two or three thousandth part of an inch: and yet, on Microme-\n\naccount of the small scale of these micrometers, these quantities are of the greatest consequence; an error of a single thousandth part inducing in most instruments a mistake of several seconds.\n\n34. The greatest imperfection of all is, that the wires require to be illuminated; and when Dr. Herschel had double stars to measure, one of which was very obscure, he was obliged to be content with less light than is necessary to make the wires distinct; and several stars on this account could not be measured at all, though not too close for the micrometer.\n\nDr. Herschel, therefore, was led to direct his attention to the improvement of these instruments; and the result of his endeavours has been a very ingenious lamp-micrometer, which is not only free from the imperfections above specified, but also possesses the advantages of a large scale.\n\n35. It is represented in fig. 14, where A B G C F E is a Dr. Her-\n\nFig. 14.\nand nine feet high, upon which a semicircular board (the lamp-ghoq) is moveable upwards or downwards, and is held ter-\nin its situation by a peg p put into any one of the holes of the upright piece A R. This board is a segment of a circle of fourteen inches radius, and is about three inches broader than a semicircle, to give room for the handles r D, e P, to work. The use of this board is to carry an arm L, thirty inches long, which is made to move upon a pivot at the centre of the circle, by means of a string, which passes in a groove upon the edge of the semicircle ghoq; the string is fastened to a hook at o (not expressed in the figure, being at the back of the arm L), and passing along the groove from o h to q is turned over a pulley at q, and goes down to a small barrel e, within the plane of the circular board, where a double-jointed handle e P commands its motion. By this contrivance, we see, the arm L may be lifted up to any altitude from the horizontal position to the perpendicular, or be suffered to descend by its own weight below the horizontal to the reverse perpendicular situation. The weight of the handle P is sufficient to keep the arm in any given position; but if the motion should be too easy, a friction spring applied to the barrel will moderate it at pleasure.\n\n36. In front of the arm L a final slider, about three inches long, is moveable in a rabbet from the end L towards the centre backwards and forwards. A string is fastened to the left side of the little slider, and goes towards L, where it passes round a pulley at m, and returns under the arm from m, n, towards the centre, where it is led in a groove on the edge of the arm, which is of a circular form, upwards to a barrel (raised above the plane of the circular board) at r, to which the handle r D is fastened. A second string is fastened to the slider, at the right side, and goes towards the centre, where it passes over a pulley n; and the weight w, which is suspended by the end of this string, returns the slider towards the centre, when a contrary turn of the handle permits it to act.\n\n37. By a and b are represented two small lamps, two inches high, 1/2 in breadth by 1/2 in depth. The sides, back, and top, are made so as to permit no light to be seen, and the front consists of a thin brass sliding door. The flame in the lamp a is placed three-tenths of an inch\n\n(D) These imperfections are remedied in the instrument described in p. 801.\nMicrometers from the left side, three-tenths from the front, and half an inch from the bottom. In the lamp b it is placed at the same height and distance, measuring from the right side. The wick of the flame consists only of a single very thin lamp cotton thread; for the smallest flame being sufficient, it is easier to keep it burning in so confined a place. In the top of each lamp must be a little slit lengthways, and a small opening in one side near the upper part, to permit the air to circulate to feed the flame. To prevent every reflection of light, the side opening of the lamp a should be to the right, and that of the lamp b to the left. In the sliding door of each lamp is made a small hole with the point of a very fine needle just opposite the place where the wicks are burning, so that when the sliders are shut down, and everything dark, nothing shall be seen but two fine lucid points of the size of two stars of the third or fourth magnitude. The lamp c is placed so that its lucid point may be in the centre of the circular board where it is fixed. The lamp d is hung to the little slider which moves in the rabbet of the arm, so that its lucid point, in an horizontal position of the arm, may be on a level with the lucid point in the centre. The moveable lamp is suspended upon a piece of braids fastened to the slider by a pin exactly behind the flame, upon which it moves as a pivot. The lamp is balanced at the bottom by a leaden weight, so as to remain upright, when the arm is either lifted above or depressed below the horizontal position. The double-jointed handles rD, eP, consist of deal rods, 10 feet long, and the lowest of them may have divisions, marked upon it near the end P, expressing exactly the distance from the central lucid point in feet, inches, and tenths.\n\n38. Hence we see, that a person at a distance of 10 feet may govern the two lucid points, so as to bring them into any required position south or north preceding or following from 0 to 90\u00b0 by using the handle P, and also to any distance from six-tenths of an inch to five or six and twenty inches by means of the handle D. If any reflection or appearance of light should be left from the top or sides of the lamps, a temporary screen, consisting of a long piece of pasteboard, or a wire frame covered with black cloth, of the length of the whole arm, and of any required breadth, with a slit of a half an inch broad in the middle, may be affixed to the arm by four bent wires projecting an inch or two before the lamps, situated so that the moveable lucid point may pass along the opening left for that purpose.\n\nFig. 15 represents part of the arm L, half the real size; S the slider; m the pulley, over which the cord xyzyz is returned towards the centre; v the other cord going to the pulley n of fig. 14. R the braids piece moveable upon the pin e, to keep the lamp upright. At R is a wire riveted to the braids piece, upon which is held the lamp by a nut and screw. Fig. 16, 17 represent the lamps a, l, with the sliding doors open, to show the situation of the wicks. W is the leaden weight with a hole d in it, through which the wire R of fig. 15, is to be passed when the lamp is to be fastened to the slider S. Fig. 18 represents the lamp a with the sliding door shut; f the lucid point; and i the openings at the top, and s at the sides, for the admission of air.\n\n39. The motions of this micrometer are capable of great improvement by the application of wheels and pinions, and other mechanical resources; but as the principal object is only to be able to adjust the two lucid points to the required position and distance, and to keep them there for a few minutes, while the observer measures their distance, it will be unnecessary to say more upon the subject.\n\n40. It is well known that we can with one eye look into a telescope, and see an object much magnified, while the other eye may see a scale upon which the magnified picture is thrown. In this manner Dr Herschel generally determined the power of his telescopes; and anyone who has been accustomed to make such observations will seldom mistake so much as one in fifty in determining the power of an instrument, and that degree of exactness is fully sufficient for the purpose.\n\n41. When Dr Herschel uses this instrument he puts it at ten feet distance from the left eye, in a line perpendicular to the tube of his Newtonian telescope, and raises the moveable board to such a height that the lucid point of the central lamp may be upon a level with the eye. The handles, lifted up, are passed through two loops fastened to the tube, just by the observer, to as to be ready for his use. The end of the tube is cut away, so as to leave the left eye entirely free to see the whole micrometer.\n\n42. The telescope being directed to a double star, it is viewed with the right eye, and at the same time with the left it is seen projected upon the micrometer; then, by the handle P, the arm is raised or depressed so as to bring the two lucid points to a similar situation with the two stars; and, by the handle D, the moveable lucid point is brought to the same distance of the two stars, so that the two lucid points may be exactly covered by the stars.\n\n43. With a rule divided into inches and forty parts, the distance of the lucid points is thus determined with the greatest accuracy; and the measure thus obtained is the tangent of the magnified angle under which the stars are seen to a radius of ten feet; therefore, the angle being found and divided by the power of the telescope, the real angular distance of the centres of a double star is ascertained. On September 25, 1781, Dr Herschel measured a Herculis with this instrument. Having caused the two lucid points to coincide with the stars, he found the radius or distance of the central lamp from the eye 10 feet 4.45 inches; the tangent or distance of the two lucid points 50.6 forty parts of an inch; this gives the magnified angle 35\u00b0, and dividing by the power 460, we obtain 4\" 34\"' for the distance of the centres of the two stars. The scale of the micrometer at this convenient distance, with the power of 460, is above a quarter of an inch to a second; and by putting on a power of 922, we obtain a scale of more than half an inch to a second, without increasing the distance of the micrometer; whereas the most perfect micrometers, with the same instrument, had a scale of less than the two thousandth part of an inch to a second.\n\n44. Mr Brewster has lately directed his attention to Mr Brewster's improvement of micrometers, and has invented one in her's particular which appears to be highly deserving of notice in this place. In this instrument a pair of fixed wires is made to subtend different angles by varying the magnifying power of the telescope, by sliding one tube within another; whereas in all other micrometers with wires...\nwires this effect is produced by mechanical contrivances. Mr Brewster's method of shutting and opening the wires optically is therefore free from all those sources of error to which other micrometers are subject, and renders it particularly useful to the practical astronomer; while the mode of changing the magnifying power by the motion of a second object glass affords a length of scale equal to the local distance of the principal object-glass. The same principle is peculiarly applicable to the Gregorian telescope; for the magnifying power of this instrument can be changed by merely increasing or diminishing the distance of the eye-piece from the large speculum.\n\n45. In the common micrometer, which can manifestly, as well as Mr Cavallo's and Mr Brewster's, be used in the measurement of distances, the focal length of the telescope to which it is attached remains always the same; so that a correction computed from an optical theorem must be applied to every angle that is measured; but in Mr Brewster's telescope and micrometer, the focal length varies in the same proportion as the distance of the object; and consequently no correction of the angles can be necessary. To obviate the necessity of having a stand for the instrument, which would prevent its usefulness at sea, Mr Brewster divides the second or moveable object-glass into two, as in the divided object-glass micrometer. By this contrivance two images are formed, and these images are separated or made to form different angles at the eye, by bringing the moveable object-glass nearer to the fixed one. In determining the angle, therefore, we have only to bring the two images of the object into contact; and such contact the eye is capable of ascertaining even during the agitation of a carriage, as the two images retain the same relative position whatever be their absolute motion.\n\nThis ingenious instrument, being formed with sliding tubes, is very portable and convenient; and will be found extremely useful to military gentlemen, and others who may wish to ascertain distances without a more cumbersome apparatus. Haidy's Nat. Phil. by Gregory, v. ii. p. 427.\n\n46. Mr Brewster, we understand, still continues to direct his attention to the subject of micrometers, keeping in view the improvement of these instruments, not only in greater accuracy of construction, but also in their more extensive application to various practical purposes. An account of those uses and improvements is to form the subject of an appropriate publication; and, if we are rightly informed, the author deems them of sufficient importance to secure to himself, by patent, the exclusive right to the advantages which he thinks will arise from using them.\n\n47. A very simple micrometer for measuring small angles with the telescope has been invented by Mr Cavallo. It consists of a thin and narrow slip of mother-of-pearl finely divided, and situated in the focus of the eye-glass of a telescope, just where the image of the object is formed. It is immaterial whether the telescope be a refractor or a reflector, provided the eye-glass be a convex lens.\n\nThe simplest way of fixing it is to stick it upon the diaphragm, which generally stands within the tube, in the focus of the eye-glass. When thus fixed, the divisions of the micrometrical scale will appear very distinct, unless the diaphragm is not exactly in the focus; in which case, the scale must be placed accurately in the focus of the eye-glass, either by moving the diaphragm, or by interposing any thin substance, such as paper or card between it and the scale. This construction is fully sufficient, when the telescope is always to be used by the same person; but when different persons are to use it, then the diaphragm which supports the micrometer must be constructed so as to be easily moved backwards or forwards, though that motion need not be greater than about \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) or \\( \\frac{1}{16} \\) of an inch.\n\nThe scale of the micrometer is represented in fig. 19 (fig. 19), which is about four times greater than one which Mr Cavallo has adapted to a three feet achromatic telescope that magnifies about 84 times. It is something less than the 24th part of an inch broad; its thickness is equal to that of common writing paper; and the length of it is determined by the breadth of the field of view. The divisions are 2000ths of an inch, and the lines which form them reach from one edge of the scale to about the middle of it, excepting every fifth and tenth division, which are longer. Two divisions of the scale in the telescope already mentioned are very nearly equal to one minute; and as a quarter of one of those divisions may be easily distinguished by the eye, an angle of one-eighth part of a minute, or of \\( \\frac{7}{3} \\), may be measured with it.\n\nIn looking through a telescope furnished with such a micrometer, the field of view appears divided by the micrometer scale, the breadth of which occupies about \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)th of the aperture; and as the scale is semitransparent, that part of the object which is behind it may be discerned sufficiently well to ascertain the division, with which its borders coincide. Fig. 20 shows the appearance of the field of the telescope with the micrometer, when directed to the title page of the Philosophical Transactions, in which it appears that the thickness of the letter C is equal to three-fourths of a division, the diameter of the O is equal to three divisions, and so on.\n\n48. After having adapted this micrometer to the telescope, we must then ascertain the value of the divisions. It is hardly necessary to mention in this place, that though those divisions measure the chords of the angles, and not the angles or arches themselves, and the chords are not as the arches, yet in small angles the chords, arches, sines, and tangents, follow the same proportion to very nearly, that the difference may be safely neglected: so that if one division of this micrometer is equal to one minute, we may conclude, that two divisions are equal to two minutes, three divisions to three minutes, and so on. In order to ascertain the value of the divisions of this micrometer, the following simple and accurate method may be adopted.\n\nMark upon a wall the length of six inches, by making two dots or lines six inches asunder, or by fixing a six inch ruler upon a stand; then place the telescope before it so that the ruler or six-inch length may be at right angles with the direction of the telescope, and just 37 feet 3\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inches distant from the object-glass of the telescope: this done, look through the telescope at the ruler or other extension of six inches, and observe how many divisions of the micrometer are equal to it, and that same number of divisions is equal to half a degree, or \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) as may be shown by plane trigonometry.\n\n49. When this value has been once ascertained, any other angle measured by any other number of divisions is determined by simple proportion. Thus, if the diameter of the sun seen through the same telescope, be equal to\nMicrometer. 12 divisions, say as \\( \\frac{1}{11} \\) divisions are to 30 minutes, so are 12 divisions to \\( \\left( \\frac{12}{11} \\times \\frac{30}{1} \\right) = 31.3 \\), which is the required diameter of the sun.\n\nNotwithstanding the facility of this calculation, a scale may be made answering to the divisions of a micrometer, which will show the angle corresponding to any number of divisions by mere inspection. Thus, for the above-mentioned small telescope, the scale is represented in fig. 21. AB is a line drawn at pleasure; it is then divided into 23 equal parts, and those divisions which represent the divisions of the micrometer that are equal to one degree, are marked on one side of it. The line then is divided again into 60 equal parts, which are marked on the other side of it; and these divisions represent the minutes which correspond to the divisions of the micrometer; thus the figure shows, that six divisions of the micrometer are equal to \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) minutes, \\( \\frac{1}{11} \\) divisions are nearly equal to 20 minutes, &c. What has been said of minutes may be said of seconds also, when the scale is to be applied to a large telescope.\n\nSo we shall therefore add some practical rules to render this micrometer useful to persons unacquainted with trigonometry and the use of logarithms.\n\nProblem I. The angle, not exceeding one degree, which is subtended by an extension of one foot perpendicular to the axis of the telescope being given, to find its distance from the object-glass of the telescope.\n\nRule 1. If the angle be expressed in minutes, say, as the given angle is to 60, so is 687.55 to a fourth proportional, which gives the answer in inches.\n\nExample. At what distance is a globe of one foot diameter when it subtends an angle of two seconds?\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2''}{3600''} : \\frac{687.55}{60} = \\frac{3600 \\times 687.55}{2} = 1237590\n\\]\n\ninches, or 10313 feet, which is the answer required.\n\nProblem II. The angle, not exceeding one degree, which is subtended by any known extension, being given, to find its distance from the object-glass of the telescope.\n\nRule. Proceed as if the extension were of one foot by Problem I, and call the answer B; then, if the extension in question be expressed in inches, say, as 12 inches are to that extension, so is B to a fourth proportional, which is the answer in inches; but if the extension in question be expressed in feet, then you need only multiply it by B, and the product is the answer in inches.\n\nExample. At what distance is a man six feet high, when he appears to subtend an angle of 30\u00b0?\n\nBy Problem I. If the man were one foot high, the distance would be 82506 inches; but as he is six feet high, therefore multiply 82506 by 6, and the product gives the required distance, which is 495036 inches, or 41253 feet.\n\nFor greater convenience, especially in travelling, or in such circumstances in which one has not the opportunity of making even the easy calculations required in those problems, the following two tables have been computed; the first of which shows the distance answering to any angle from one minute to one degree, which is subtended by a man, the height of which has been called an extension of six feet; because, at a mean, such is the height of a man when dressed with hat and Microshoes on.\n\nThus, if it is required to measure the extension of a street, let a foot ruler be placed at the end of the street; measure the angle it subtends, which suppose to be 36\u00b0, and in the table you will have the required distance opposite 36\u00b0, which is 9\u00bd feet. Thus also a man who appears to be 49' high, is at the distance of 421 feet.\n\nAngles subtended by an Extension of one Foot at different Distances.\n\n| Angles | Distances in Feet |\n|--------|------------------|\n| Min.   | 1                |\n|        | 3437.7           |\n|        | 1718.9           |\n|        | 1145.9           |\n|        | 859.4            |\n|        | 687.5            |\n|        | 572.9            |\n|        | 491.1            |\n|        | 429.7            |\n|        | 382.0            |\n|        | 343.7            |\n|        | 312.5            |\n|        | 286.5            |\n|        | 264.4            |\n|        | 245.5            |\n|        | 229.2            |\n|        | 214.8            |\n|        | 202.2            |\n|        | 191.0            |\n|        | 180.9            |\n|        | 171.8            |\n|        | 162.7            |\n|        | 156.2            |\n|        | 149.4            |\n|        | 143.2            |\n|        | 137.5            |\n|        | 132.2            |\n|        | 127.3            |\n|        | 122.7            |\n|        | 118.5            |\n|        | 114.6            |\n\nAngles subtended by an Extension of six Feet at different Distances.\n\n| Angles | Distances in Feet |\n|--------|------------------|\n| Min.   | 1                |\n|        | 20626.8          |\n|        | 10313.3          |\n|        | 6875.4           |\n|        | 5156.5           |\n|        | 4125.2           |\n|        | 3437.7           |\n|        | 2916.6           |\n|        | 2578.2           |\n|        | 2291.8           |\n|        | 2062.6           |\n|        | 1875.2           |\n|        | 1718.8           |\n|        | 1586.7           |\n|        | 1473.3           |\n|        | 1375.1           |\n|        | 1298.1           |\n|        | 1213.3           |\n|        | 1145.9           |\n|        | 1085.6           |\n|        | 1031.4           |\n|        | 982.2            |\n|        | 937.6            |\n|        | 866.8            |\n|        | 859.4            |\n|        | 825.1            |\n|        | 793.3            |\nMr Brewster's circular mother-of-pearl micrometer.\n\nThe following is the account of a micrometer invented by Mr Brewster, of the circumstances which led to the invention, and of its advantages. We shall give it in his own words:\n\n\"In the winter of 1805 (he observes), when I was employed in delineating the surface of the moon, I wished to measure the diameter of the lunar spots by applying Mr Cavallo's micrometer to a thirty-inch achromatic telescope made by Berge. But as the eyepiece was moved by a rack and pinion, and consequently could not turn round its axis, the micrometer must have remained stationary, and could only measure angles in one direction. This difficulty, indeed, might have been surmounted by a mechanical contrivance for turning the diaphragm about its centre, or more simply by giving a motion of rotation to the tube which contains the third and fourth eye-glasses. Such a change in the eye-piece, however, was both inconvenient and difficult to be made. Mr Cavallo's micrometer, therefore, has this great disadvantage, that it cannot be used in reflecting telescopes, or in any achromatic telescope where the adjustment of the eye-piece is effected by rackwork, unless the structure of these instruments is altered for the purpose. Another disadvantage of this micrometer arises from the slip of mother-of-pearl passing through the centre of the field. The picture in the focus of the eye-glass is broken into two parts, and the view is rendered still more unpleasant by the inequality of the segments into which the field is divided. In addition to these disadvantages, the different divisions of the micrometer are at unequal distances from the eye-glass which views them, and therefore can neither appear equally distinct nor subtend equal angles at the eye.\n\nFinding that Mr Cavallo's instrument laboured under these imperfections, I thought of a circular mother-of-pearl micrometer which is free from them all, and has likewise the advantage of a kind of diagonal scale, increasing in accuracy with the angle to be measured. This micrometer, which I got executed by Miller and Adie, optical instrument-makers in Edinburgh, and which I have often used, both in determining small\n\n| Angles | Distances in Feet |\n|--------|------------------|\n| Min. 27 | 763.9 |\n| 28     | 736.6 |\n| 29     | 711.3 |\n| 30     | 687.5 |\n| 31     | 665.4 |\n| 32     | 644.5 |\n| 33     | 625.5 |\n| 34     | 606.6 |\n| 35     | 589.3 |\n| 36     | 572.9 |\n| 37     | 557.5 |\n| 38     | 542.8 |\n| 39     | 528.9 |\n| 40     | 515.6 |\n| 41     | 503.1 |\n| 42     | 491.1 |\n| 43     | 479.7 |\n\n| Angles | Distances in Feet |\n|--------|------------------|\n| Min. 44 | 46.88 |\n| 45     | 45.84 |\n| 46     | 44.84 |\n| 47     | 43.89 |\n| 48     | 42.97 |\n| 49     | 42.17 |\n| 50     | 41.25 |\n| 51     | 40.44 |\n| 52     | 39.67 |\n| 53     | 38.92 |\n| 54     | 38.19 |\n| 55     | 37.51 |\n| 56     | 36.83 |\n| 57     | 36.19 |\n| 58     | 35.56 |\n| 59     | 34.96 |\n| 60     | 34.37 |\n\nangles in the heavens and such as are subtended by terrestrial objects, is represented in fig. 27, which exhibits its appearances in the focus of the fourth eye-glass. The black ring, which forms part of the figure, is the diaphragm, and the remaining part is a ring of mother-of-pearl, having its interior circumference divided into 365 equal parts. The mother-of-pearl ring, which appears connected with the diaphragm, is completely separate from it, and is fixed at the end of a brass tube which is made to move between the third eye-glass and the diaphragm, so that the divided circumference may be placed exactly in the focus of the glass next the eye. When the micrometer is thus fitted into the telescope, the angle subtended by the whole field of view, or by the diameter of the innermost circle of the micrometer, must be determined either by measuring a base or by the passage of an equatorial star, and the angles subtended by any number of divisions or degrees will be found by a table constructed in the following manner.\n\nLet \\( A \\) \\( m \\) \\( p \\) \\( n \\) \\( B \\), fig. 28, be the interior circumference of the micrometer scale, and let \\( m \\) \\( n \\) be the object to be measured. Bisect the arch \\( m \\) \\( n \\) in \\( p \\), and draw \\( C \\) \\( m \\), \\( C \\) \\( p \\), \\( C \\) \\( n \\). The line \\( C \\) \\( p \\) will be at right angles to \\( m \\) \\( n \\), and therefore \\( m \\) \\( n \\) will be twice the sine of half the arch \\( m \\) \\( n \\). Consequently, \\( A \\) \\( B \\) : \\( m \\) \\( n \\) = rad. fine of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) \\( m \\) \\( p \\) \\( n \\); therefore \\( m \\) \\( n \\times R = \\sin \\frac{1}{2} m \\) \\( p \\) \\( n \\times A \\) \\( B \\), and \\( m \\) \\( p \\) \\( n = \\frac{\\sin \\frac{1}{2} m \\) \\( p \\) \\( n \\times A \\) \\( B}{R} = \\frac{\\sin \\frac{1}{2} m \\) \\( p \\) \\( n}{R} \\times A \\) \\( B \\); a formula by which the angle subtended by the chord of any number of degrees may be easily found. The first part of the formula, viz. \\( \\frac{\\sin \\frac{1}{2} m \\) \\( p \\) \\( n}{R} \\) is constant, while \\( A \\) \\( B \\) varies with the size of the micrometer and with the magnifying power which is applied. We have therefore computed the following table, containing the value of the constant part of the formula for every degree or division of the scale.\n\n| Deg. | Constant Part of the Formula

In order to find the angle subtended by any number of degrees, we have only to multiply the constant part of the formula corresponding to that number in the table by A.B., or the angle subtended by the whole field. Thus if A.B. is 30 minutes, as it happens to be in the micrometer which I have constructed, the angle subtended by 1 degree of the scale will be $30 \\times 0.009 = 16\\frac{1}{2}$ seconds, and the angle subtended by 40 degrees will be $30 \\times 0.342 = 10\\frac{1}{2} \\times 15.6''$; and by making the calculation it will be found that as the angle to be measured increases, the accuracy of the scale also increases; for when the arch is only 1 or 2 degrees, a variation of 1 degree produces a variation of about 16 seconds in the angle; whereas when the arch is between 170 and 180, the variation of a degree does not produce a change much more than one second in the angle. This is an important advantage in the circular scale, as in Cavallo's micrometer a limit is necessarily put to the size of the divisions.\n\n\"It is obvious, from an inspection of fig. 27, that there is no occasion for turning the circular micrometer round its axis, because the divided circumference lies in every possible direction. In fig. 2, for example, if the object has the direction a b it will be measured by the arch a o b, and if it lies in the line c d it will be measured by the arch c r d.\"\n\n\"In the circular micrometer which I have been in the habit of using, A.B., or the diameter of the field of view, is exactly half an inch, the diameter of the brass tube in which it is fixed is one inch, the length of the tube half an inch, and the degrees of the divided circumference $\\frac{1}{4}$ th of an inch.\"\n\n54. II. The micrometer has not only been applied to telescopes, and employed for astronomical purposes; but there have also been various contrivances for adapting it to MICROSCOPICAL observations. Mr Leeuwenhoek's method of estimating the size of small objects was by the microscope, comparing them with grains of sand, of which 100 in diameter to a line took up an inch. These grains he laid upon the microscope, placed plate with his objects, and viewed them at the same time. Dr Jurin's method was similar to this; for he found the diameter of a piece of fine silver wire, by wrapping it as close as he could about a pin, and observing how many rings made an inch; and he used this wire in the same manner as Leeuwenhoek employed his sand. Dr Hooke looked upon the magnified object with one eye, while at the same time he viewed other objects placed at the same distance with the other eye. In this manner he was able, by the help of a ruler, divided into inches and small parts, and laid on the pedestal of the microscope, to call it as it were the magnified appearance of the object upon the ruler, and thus exactly to measure the diameter which it appeared to have through the glass; which being compared with the diameter as it appeared to the naked eye, showed the degree in which it was magnified.\n\n55. Mr Martin recommended such a micrometer for Martin's microscope as had been applied to telescopes; for he advises to draw a number of parallel lines on a piece of glass, with the fine point of a diamond, at the distance of one fourtieth of an inch from one another, and to place it in the focus of the eye-glass. By this method, Dr Smith contrived to take the exact draught of objects viewed by a double microscope; for he advises to get a lattice, made with small silver wires or squares, drawn upon a plain glass by the strokes of a diamond, and to put it into the place of the image, formed by the object glass; then by transferring the parts of the object, seen in the squares of the glass or lattice upon similar corresponding squares drawn on paper, the picture may be exactly taken. Mr Martin also introduced into compound microscopes another micrometer, consisting of a screw.\n\n65. The mode of actual measurement (Mr Adams observes) is without doubt the most simple that can be used; as by it we comprehend, in a manner, at one glance, the different effects of combined glasses; and as it saves the trouble, and avoids the obscurity, of the usual modes of calculation: but many persons find it exceedingly difficult to adopt this method, because they have not been accustomed to observe with both eyes at once. To obviate this inconvenience, the late Mr Adams contrived an instrument called the Needle-Micrometer, which was first described in his Micrographia Illustrata; and of which, as now constructed, we have the following description by his son Mr George Adams in the ingenious Essays above quoted.\n\nThis micrometer consists of a screw, which has 50 threads to an inch; this screw carries an index, which points to the divisions on a circular plate, which is fixed at right angles to the axis of the screw. The revolutions of the screw are counted on a scale, which is an inch divided into 50 parts; the index to these divisions is a flower-de-luce marked upon the slider, which carries the needle point across the field of the microscope. Every revolution of the micrometer screw measures $\\frac{1}{50}$ th part of an inch, which is again subdivided by means of the divisions on the circular plate,\nMicrometer.\n\nMicrometer as this is divided into 20 equal parts, over which the index passes at every revolution of the screw; by which means we obtain with ease the measure of 1000th part of an inch: for 50, the number of threads on the screw in one inch, being multiplied by 20, the divisions on the circular plate are equal to 1000; so that each division on the circular plate shows that the needle has either advanced or receded 1000th part of an inch.\n\n57. To place this micrometer on the body of the microscope, open the circular part FKH, fig. 25, by taking out the screw G, throw back the semicircle FK, which moves upon a joint at K; then turn the sliding tube of the body of the microscope, so that the small holes which are in both tubes may exactly coincide, and let the needle g of the micrometer have a free passage through them; after this, screw it fast upon the body by the screw G. The needle will now traverse the field of the microscope, and measure the length and breadth of the image of any object that is applied to it.\n\nBut further affluence must be had, in order to measure the object itself, which is a subject of real importance; for though we have ascertained the power of the microscope, and know that it is so many thousand times, yet this will be of little affluence towards ascertaining an accurate idea of its real size; for our ideas of bulk being formed by the comparison of one object with another, we can only judge of that of any particular body, by comparing it with another whose size is known: the same thing is necessary, in order to form an estimate by the microscope; therefore, to ascertain the real measure of the object, we must make the point of the needle pass over the image of a known part of an inch placed on the stage, and write down the revolutions made by the screw, while the needle passed over the image of this known measure; by which means we ascertain the number of revolutions on the screw, which are adequate to a real and known measure on the stage. As it requires an attentive eye to watch the motion of the needle point as it passes over the image of a known part of an inch on the stage, we ought not to trust to one single measurement of the image, but ought to repeat it at least five times; then add the five measures thus obtained together, and divide their sum by five, or the number of trials; the quotient will be the mean of all the trials. This result is to be placed in a column of a table next to that which contains the number of the magnifiers.\n\n58. By the affluence of the sectoral scale, we obtain with ease a small part of an inch. This scale is shown at figs. 22, 23, 24, in which the two lines ca, cb, with the side ab, form an isosceles triangle; each of the sides is two inches long, and the base still only of one-tenth of an inch. The longer sides may be of any given length, and the base still only of one tenth of an inch. The longer lines may be considered as the line of lines upon a sector opened to one-tenth of an inch. Hence whatever number of equal parts ca, cb are divided into, their transverse measure will be such a part of one-tenth as is expressed by their divisions. Thus if it be divided into ten equal parts, this will divide the inch into 100 equal parts; the first division next e will be equal to 100th part of an inch, because it is the tenth part of one-tenth of an inch. If these lines are divided into twenty equal parts, the inch will be by that means divided into 200 equal parts. Lastly, if ab, ca, are made three inches long, and divided into 100 equal parts, we obtain with ease the 1000th part. The scale is represented as folio at fig. 23, but as perforated at fig. 22, and 24, so that the light passes through the aperture, when the sectoral part is placed on the stage.\n\n59. To use this scale, first fix the micrometer, fig. 25, to the body of the microscope; then fit the sectoral scale, fig. 24, in the stage, and adjust the microscope to its proper focus or distance from the scale, which is to be moved till the base appears in the middle of the field of view; then bring the needle point g, fig. 25, (by turning the screw L) to touch one of the lines ca, exactly at the point answering to 20 on the sectoral scale. The index a of the micrometer is to be set to the first division, and that on the dial plate to 20, which is both the beginning and end of its divisions; we are then prepared to find the magnifying power of every magnifier in the compound microscope which we are using.\n\n60. Example. Every thing being prepared agreeable to the foregoing directions, suppose you are desirous of ascertaining the magnifying power of the lens marked No. 4, turn the micrometer screw until the point of the needle has passed over the magnified image of the tenth part of an inch; then the division, where the two indices remain, will show how many revolutions, and parts of a revolution, the screw has made, while the needle point traversed the magnified image of the one-tenth of an inch; suppose the result to be 26 revolutions of the screw, and 14 parts of another revolution, this is equal to 26 multiplied by 20, added to 14; that is, 534,000 parts of an inch.\u2014The 26 divisions found on the straight scale of the micrometer, while the point of the needle passed over the magnified image of one-tenth part of an inch, were multiplied by 20, because the circular plate CD, fig. 25, is divided into 20 equal parts; this produced 520; then adding the 14 parts of the next revolution, we obtain the 534,000 parts of an inch, or five tenths and 3400 parts of another tenth, which is the measure of the magnified image of one-tenth of an inch, at the aperture of the eye-glasses or at their foci. Now if we suppose the focus of the two eye-glasses to be one inch, the double thereof is two inches; or if we reckon on the 1000th part of an inch, we have 2000 parts for the distance of the eye from the needle point of the micrometer. Again, if we take the distance of the image from the object at the stage at 6 inches, or 6000, and add thereto 2000, double the distance of the focus of the eye-glasses, we shall have 8000 parts of an inch for the distance of the eye from the object; and as the glasses double the image, we must double the number 534 found upon the micrometer, which then makes 1068; then, by the following analogy, we shall obtain the number of times the microscope magnifies the diameter of the object; say, as 240, the distance of the eye from the image of the object, is to 800, the distance of the eye from the object; so is 1068, double the measure found on the micrometer, to 3563, or the number of times the microscope magnifies the diameter of the object. By working in this manner, the magnifying power of each lens used with the compound microscope may be easily found, though the result will\nbe different in different compound microscopes, varying according to the combination of the lenses, their distance from the object and one another, &c.\n\n61. Having discovered the magnifying power of the microscope, with the different object-lenses that are used therewith, our next subject is to find out the real size of the objects themselves, and their different parts: this is easily effected, by finding how many revolutions of the micrometer screw answer to a known measure on the sectorial scale or other object placed on the stage; from the number thus found, a table should be constructed, expressing the value of the different revolutions of the micrometer with that object lens, by which the primary number was obtained. Similar tables must be constructed for each object lens. By a set of tables of this kind, the observer may readily find the measure of any object he is examining; for he has only to make the needle point traverse over this object, and observe the number of revolutions the screw has made in its passage, and then look into his table for the real measure which corresponds to this number of revolutions, which is the measure required.\n\n62. Mr Coventry of Southwark has favoured us with the description of a micrometer of his own invention; the scale of which, for minuteness, surpasses every instrument of the kind of which we have any knowledge, and of which, indeed, we could scarcely have formed a conception, had he not indulged us with several of these instruments, graduated as underneath.\n\nThe micrometer is composed of glass, ivory, silver, &c., on which are drawn parallel lines from the 10th to the 10,000th part of an inch. But an instrument thus divided, he observes, is more for curiosity than use; but one of those which Mr Coventry has lent us is divided into squares, so small that fifteen millions of them are contained on the surface of one square inch, each square appearing under the microscope true and distinct; and though so small, it is a fact, that animalcula are found which may be contained in one of these squares.\n\nThe use of micrometers, when applied to microscopes, is to measure the natural size of the object, and how much that object is magnified. To ascertain the real size of an object in the single microscope, nothing more is required than to lay it on the micrometer, and adjust it to the focus of the magnifier, noticing how many divisions of the micrometer it covers. Suppose the parallel lines of the micrometer to be the 1000th of an inch, and the object covers two divisions; its real size is 500ths of an inch; if five, 200ths, and so on.\n\nBut to find how much the object is magnified, is not mathematically determined so easily by the single as by the compound microscope: but the following simple method (says Mr Coventry) I have generally adopted, and think it tolerably accurate. Adjust a micrometer under the microscope o, say the 100th of an inch of divisions, with a small object on it; if square, the better: notice how many divisions one side of the object covers, suppose 10; then cut a piece of white paper something larger than the magnified appearance of the object: then fix one eye on the object through the microscope, and the other at the same time on the paper, lowering it down till the object and the paper appear level and distinct: then cut the paper till it appear exactly the size of the magnified object; the paper being then measured, suppose an inch square: Now, as the object under the magnifier, which appeared to be one inch square, was in reality only ten hundredths, or the tenth of an inch, the experiment proves that it is magnified ten times in length, one hundred times in superficies, and one thousand times in cube, which is the magnifying power of the glass; and, in the same manner, a table may be made of the power of all the other glasses.\n\nIn using the compound microscope, the real size of the object is found by the same method as in the single; but to demonstrate the magnifying power of each glass to greater certainty, adopt the following method.\u2014Lay a two-feet rule on the stage, and a micrometer level with its surface (an inch suppose, divided into 100 parts): with one eye see how many of those parts are contained in the field of the microscope, (suppose 50); and with the other, at the same time, look for the circle of light in the field of the microscope, which with a little practice will soon appear distinct; mark how much of the rule is intercepted by the circle of light, which will be half the diameter of the field. Suppose eight inches; consequently the whole diameter will be sixteen. Now, as the real size of the field, by the micrometers, appeared to be only 50 hundredths, or half an inch, and as half an inch is only one 32d part of 16 inches, it shows the magnifying power of the glass to be 32 times in length, 1024 superficies, and 32,768 cube (E).\n\n63. Another way of finding the magnifying power of compound microscopes, is by using two micrometers of the same divisions; one adjusted under the magnifier, the other fixed in the body of the microscope in the focus of the eye-glass. Notice how many divisions of the micrometer in the body are seen in one division of the micrometer under the magnifier, which again must be multiplied by the power of the eye-glass. Example: Ten divisions of the micrometer in the body are contained in one division under the magnifier; so far the power is increased ten times: now, if the eye-glass be one inch focus, such glass will itself magnify about seven times in length, which, with the ten times magnified before, will be seven times ten, or 70 times in length, 4900 superficies, and 343,000 cube.\n\n\"If (says Mr Coventry) these micrometers are employed in the solar microscope, they divide the object into squares on the screen in such a manner as to render it extremely easy to make a drawing of it. And (says he) I apprehend they may be employed to great advantage with such a microscope as Mr Adams's lenticular; because this instrument may be used either by day or night, or in any place, and gives the actual magnifying power without calculation.\"\n\n(e) It will be necessary, for great accuracy, as well as for comparative observations, that the two-feet rule should always be placed at a certain distance from the eye: eight inches would, in general, be a proper distance.\nThe case with which we have been favoured by Mr Coventry contains six micrometers, two on ivory and four on glass. One of those on ivory is an inch divided into one hundred parts, every fifth line longer than the intermediate ones, and every tenth longer still, for the greater ease in counting the divisions under the microscope, and is generally used in measuring the magnifying power of microscopes. The other ivory one is divided into squares of the 50th and 100th of an inch, and is commonly employed in measuring opaque objects.\n\nThose made of glass are for transparent objects, which, when laid on them, show their natural size.\u2014That marked on the bars 100, are squares divided to the 100th of an inch; that marked 5000 are parallel lines forming nine divisions, each division the 1000th of an inch; the middle division is again divided into 5, making divisions to the 5000th of an inch. That marked 10,000 is divided in the same manner, with the middle division divided into 10, making the 10,000th of an inch. Example:\n\nThe glass micrometer without any mark is also divided, the outside lines into 100th, the next into 1000th, and the inside lines into the 4000th of an inch: these are again crossed with an equal number of lines in the same manner, making squares of the 100th, 1000th, and 4000th of an inch, thus demonstrating each other's size. The middle square of the 1000th of an inch (see fig. 26.) is divided into sixteen squares; now as 1000 squares in the length of an inch, multiplied by 1000, gives one million in an inch surface; by the same rule, one of those squares divided into 16 must be the sixteen millionth part of an inch surface. See fig. 26, which is a diminished view of the apparent surface exhibited under the magnifier No. 1. of Wilson's microscope. In viewing the smallest lines, Mr Coventry uses No. 2. or 3.; and they are all better seen, he says, by candle than by day-light.\n\nMICR\u00d3PUS, BASTARD CUDWEED: A genus of plants belonging to the syngenesia class, and in the natural method ranking under the 49th order, Compositae.

In some notices concerning this subject which we have seen, it is observed that this science is more intimately connected with the Egyptian hieroglyphics than is generally thought, and that this connection may help to explain them. In Germany this art has been revived by M. Aretin; and a pupil of his, M. Kaestner has been permitted to teach Mnemonica the new doctrine at Leipzig, but on the express condition of not allowing his hearers to write down his lectures. This seems to be a singular, and we may add a silly prohibition. The following account is given of this art in a letter from Paris in the beginning of 1807. \"During my residence, says the writer, in this metropolis I heard a great deal of a new method of mnemonique, or of a method to assist and fix our memory, invented by Gregor de Feinaigle. Notwithstanding the simplicity with which he announced his lectures in the papers, I could not determine myself to become a pupil of his, as I thought to find a quack or mountebank, and to be laughed at by my friends for having thrown away my cash in such a foolish manner. Perhaps I should hesitate to this moment about the utility of this newly invented method to assist our natural memory, had I not had the pleasure of dining at his excellency's the Count of Metternich, the Austrian ambassador, who followed, with all his secretaries, the whole course of lectures: they all spoke very advantageously of it, likewise several other persons of the first rank I met there: in consequence of this I was invited into the list of pupils, and I follow, at this moment, the lectures. All I can tell you about this method is, it is a very simple one, and easy to be learned, adapted to all ages and sexes: all difficulties in such sciences as require an extraordinary good memory, for instance, the names and epochs in history, are at once overcome and obviated. There is not one branch of science to which this method cannot be applied. It is easy to be perceived that such an invention cannot pass without some critique, and even farce, in the public prints: some of them were very injurious, and plausible enough to mislead the public, who, knowing nothing of the method, are always more ready to condemn than to assist. Mr Feinaigle, to answer all these critics at once, adopted a method not less public for Paris than the public papers, but let's public for the rest of Europe: he gave, the 24th of last month, a public exhibition to about 2000 spectators, in which he did not appear at all, only about 12 or 15 of his pupils; each of them made such an application of the method as his situation in life required. The principal parts were the following: history, about names and years; geography, with respect to longitude, latitude, number of inhabitants, square miles, &c. &c.; grammar in various languages, about different editions of the same work; pandects, their division, and title of each book, title, &c.; different systems of botany, poetry, arithmetic, &c. &c. At last one desired the company to give him one thousand words, without any connection whatsoever, and without numeric order; for instance, the word astronomer, for No. 623; wood, for No. 188; lovely, for No. 370; dynasty, for No. 23; David, for No. 92, &c. &c.; all the numbers were filled; and he repeated the whole (notwithstanding he heard these words without order, and but once,) in the numerical order; or he told you what word was given against any one number, or what number any one word bore. It is still more striking, but certainly, likewise, more difficult, to retain as many numbers however great they may be.

Hence each link is 7.92 inches in length.\n\nThe plane table is used for drawing a plan of a field, and taking such angles as are necessary to calculate its area. It is of a rectangular form, and is surrounded by a moveable frame, by means of which a sheet of paper may be fixed to its surface. It is furnished with an index by which a line may be drawn on the paper in the direction of any object in the field, and with scales of equal parts by which such lines may be made proportional to the distances of the objects from the plane table when measured by the chain, and its frame is divided into degrees for observing angles.\n\nThe crofs consists of two pair of sights set at right angles to each other upon a staff having a pike at the bottom to stick into the ground. Its use is to determine the points where a perpendicular drawn from any object to a line will meet that line; and this is effected by finding by trials a point in the line, such that the crofs being fixed over it so that one pair of the sights may be in the direction of the line, the object from which the perpendicular is to be drawn may be seen through the other pair; then the point thus found will be the bottom of the perpendicular, as is evident.\n\nA theodolite may also be applied with great advantage to land-surveying, more especially when the ground to be measured is of great extent.\n\nIn addition to these, there are other instruments employed in surveying, as the perambulator, which is used for measuring roads and other great distances. Levels, with telecopic or other sights, which are used to determine how much one place is higher or lower than another. An offset-staff for measuring the offsets and other short distances. Ten small arrows, or rods of iron or wood, which are used to mark the end of every chain length. Pickets or stakes with flags to be set up as marks or objects of direction; and lastly, scales, compasses, &c., for protracting and measuring the plan upon paper.\n\nThe observations and measurements are to be regularly entered as they are taken, in a book which is called the Field-book, and which serves as a register of all that is done or occurs in the course of the survey.\nTo Measure a Field by the Chain.\n\nLet \\( A m B C D q \\) represent a field to be measured. Let it be resolved into the triangles \\( A m B, A B D, B C D, A q D \\). Let all the sides of the large triangles \\( A B D, B C D \\), and the perpendiculars of the small ones \\( A m B, A q D \\) from their vertices \\( m, q \\) be measured by the chain, and the areas calculated by the rules delivered in this section, and their amount is the area of the whole. But if, on account of the curvature of its sides the field cannot be wholly resolved into triangles, then, either a straight line may be drawn over the curve side, so that the parts cut off from the field and those added to it, may be nearly equal. Or, without going beyond the bounds of the field, the curvilinear spaces may be measured by the rule given in Prob. XV. of this section.\n\nTo Measure a Field with the Plane Table.\n\nLet the plane table be fixed at \\( F \\), about the middle of the field \\( A B C D E \\), and its distances \\( F A, F B, F C, \\ldots \\) from the several corners of the field measured by the chain. Let the index be directed from any point assumed on the paper to the points \\( A, B, C, D, \\ldots \\) successively, and the lines \\( F a, F b, F c, \\ldots \\) drawn in these directions. Let the angles contained by these lines be observed, and the lines themselves made proportional to the distances measured. Then their extremities being joined, there will be formed a figure \\( a b c d e \\) similar to that of the field; and the area of the field may be found by calculating the areas of the several triangles of which it consists.\n\nTo Plan a Field from a given Base Line.\n\nLet two stations \\( A, B \\) be taken within the field, but not in the same straight line with any of its corners; and let their distance be measured. Then the plane table being fixed at \\( A \\), and the point \\( a \\) assumed on its surface directly above \\( A \\), let its index be directed to \\( B \\), and the straight line \\( a b \\) drawn along the side of it to represent \\( A B \\). Also, let the index be directed from \\( a \\) to an object at the corner \\( C \\), and an indefinite straight line drawn in that direction, and so of every other corner successively. Next, let the plane table be set at \\( B \\), so that \\( b \\) may be directly over \\( B \\), and \\( b a \\) in the same direction with \\( B A \\), and let a straight line be drawn from \\( b \\) in the direction \\( B C \\). The intersection of this line with the former, it is evident, will determine the point \\( C \\), and the triangle \\( a b c \\) on the paper will be similar to \\( A B C \\) in the field. In this manner all the other points are to be determined, and these being joined there will be an exact representation of the field.\n\nIf the angles at both stations were observed, as the distance between them is given, the area of the field might be calculated from these data, but the operation is too tedious for practice. It is usual therefore to measure each line in the figure that has been constructed as will render the calculation easy.","sp":123,"ep":124},{"h":"OF THE MENSURATION OF RIGHT LINES AND ANGLES","t":"The rules by which certain of the sides or angles of a triangle are to be found, when other sides and angles are given, might be considered as belonging to this part of mensuration. But as they are fully investigated and explained in the article PLANE TRIGONOMETRY, it is not necessary to deliver them also here. Referring therefore to that article, we shall employ the remainder of this section in the application of trigonometry to the mensuration of heights and distances.\n\n### Mensuration of Heights and Distances.\n\nBy the application of geometry the measurement of lines, which, on account of their position or other circumstances, are inaccessible, is reduced to the determination of angles, and of other lines which are accessible, and admit of being measured by methods sufficiently obvious.\n\nA line considered as traced on the ground may be measured with rods or a Gunter's chain of 66 feet; but more expeditiously with measuring tapes of 50 or 100 feet. By these, if the ground be tolerably even, and the direction of the line be traced pretty correctly, a distance may, by using proper care, be measured within about 3 inches of the truth in every 50 feet, so that the error may not exceed the 200th part of the whole line.\n\nVertical angles may be measured with a quadrant furnished with a plummet and sights in the manner indicated by fig. 1. and fig. 2. If an angle of elevation is to be measured, as the angle contained by a horizontal line AC, and a line drawn from A to B the top of a tower, hill, or other eminence; or to a celestial body, as a star, &c.; the centre of the quadrant must be fixed at A, and the instrument moved about A, in the vertical plane, till to an eye placed at G, the object B be seen through the two sights D, d. Then will the arch EG, cut off by the plumb-line AF, be the measure of the angle CAB.\n\nAn angle of depression CAB (fig. 2.) is to be measured exactly in the same manner, except that here the\nOf Right eye is to be placed at A the centre of the instrument, Lines and Angles. and the measure of the angle is the arch EF.\n\nBut the most convenient instrument of any for observing angles, whether vertical or horizontal, is the Theodolite. This instrument is variously constructed, so as to admit of being sold at a higher or lower price, according to the degree of accuracy the purchaser may wish to attain in his observations with it. An instrument of this kind is represented in fig. 3. Its principal parts are, 1. A telescope and its level CC, D. 2. The vertical arc BB. 3. The horizontal limb and compass AA. The limb is generally about 7 inches in diameter. 4. The staff with its parallel plates E.\n\nThe telescope CC in the best instruments is generally of the achromatic kind, in order to obtain a larger field and greater magnifying power. In the focus of the eye glass are two very fine hairs or wires, at right angles to each other, whose intersection is in the plane of the vertical arc. The object glass may be moved to different distances from the eye glass by turning the milled nut a, and thus may be accommodated to the eye of the observer and distance of the object. The screws for moving and adjusting the cross hairs, are sunk a little within the eye tube. On the outside of the telescope are two metal rings which are ground perfectly true. These are to lie on the supports e, e, called Y's, which are fixed to the vertical arc. The vertical arc BB is firmly fixed to a long axis which is at right angles to the plane of the arc. This axis is sustained by, and moveable on, the two supports, which are fixed firmly to the horizontal plate. On the upper part of the vertical arc are the two Y's for holding the telescope; the inner sides of these are so framed as to be tangents to the cylindrical rings of the telescope, and therefore bear only on one part. The telescope is confined to the Y's by two loops which turn on a joint, and may therefore be readily opened and turned back when the two pins are taken out.\n\nOne side of the vertical arc is graduated to half degrees, which are subdivided to every minute of a degree by a nonius. It is numbered each way from the middle from 0 to 90\u00b0; towards the eye end for angles of altitude, and towards the object end for angles of depression. On the other side of the vertical arc are two ranges of divisions, one for taking the upright height of timber in 100th parts of the distance between the instrument and tree whose height is to be measured; and the other for reducing hypotenusal lines to such as are horizontal.\n\nThe vertical arc is cut with teeth or a rack, and may be moved regularly, and with ease, by turning the milled nut b.\n\nThe compass is fixed to the upper horizontal plate, its ring is divided into 360\u00b0, and the bottom of the box is divided into four parts or quadrants, each of which is subdivided into 15\u00b0. The magnetic needle is supported in the middle of the box upon a steel pin finely pointed, and there is a wire trigger for throwing the needle off the point when not in use.\n\nThe horizontal limb AA consists of two plates, one moveable on the other, the outermost edge of the upper plate is chamfered to serve as an index to the degrees on the lower. The upper plate, together with the compass, vertical arc, and telescope, are easily turned round by a pinion fixed to the screw c; d is a nut for fixing the index to any part of the limb, and thereby rendering it secure, while the instrument is moved from one station to another. The horizontal limb is divided into half degrees, and numbered from the right hand towards the left; the divisions are subdivided by the nonius scale to every minute of a degree.\n\nOn the upper plate, towards the nonius, are a few divisions similar to those on the vertical arc, giving the 100th parts, for measuring the diameter of trees, buildings, &c.\n\nThe whole instrument fits on the conical ferril of a strong brass-headed staff, with three substantial wooden legs. The top or head of the staff consists of two brass plates E, parallel to each other: four screws pass through the upper plate and rest on the lower plate; by the action of these the horizontal limb may be set truly level, and for this purpose a strong pin is fixed to the outside of the plate, and connected with a ball that fits into a socket in the lower plate; the axis of the pin and ball are so framed as to be perpendicular to the plate, and consequently to the horizontal limb.\n\nThere are three adjustments necessary before the instrument is applied to the mensuration of angles. In the first place, care must be taken that the line of collimation (that is, the line of vision passing through the cross hairs) be exactly in the centre of the cylindrical rings round the telescope; in the next place, that the level be parallel to this line; and, lastly, the horizontal limb must be so let, that when the vertical arc is at zero, and the upper part moved round, the bubble of the level will remain in the middle of the open space.\n\nWhen these adjustments are made, and the instrument is to be applied to practice, the lower plate of the horizontal limb AA being supposed to remain unmoved and parallel to the horizon, the telescope is to be directed successively to the different objects, whose angular positions are to be determined, by means of the pinions at c and d; (the former of which turns the upper part of the instrument round in a horizontal plane, and the latter turns the arc BB in a vertical plane). Then, the angle which a line passing through the axis of the telescope and any object makes with the horizon, will be indicated by the arc of the vertical circle between 0\u00b0 and the index engraved on the nonius scale H fixed to the upper plate of the horizontal limb of the instrument. Also, the horizontal angle contained by two vertical planes conceived to pass through any two objects and the centre of the instrument, will be shown by the arc of the lower plate of the horizontal limb over which the index engraved on the upper plate has passed by the direction of the telescope being changed from the one object to the other.\n\nHaving thus explained shortly the nature of the instruments by which accessible lines and angles are to be measured, and the manner of applying them, we shall now shew, by a few examples, how to find from these other lines which cannot be determined by a direct measurement.\n\nExample 1. Having measured AE, a distance of Fig. 4. 200 feet in a direct horizontal line from the bottom of a tower, the angle BCD, contained by the horizontal line CD; and a line drawn from C to the top of the tower,\ntower, was measured by a quadrant, or theodolite placed at C, and found to be $47^\\circ 30'$. The centre C of the instrument was five feet above the line AE at its extremity E. It is required hence to determine AB the height of the tower.\n\nIn the right-angled triangle CBD we have given the side CD = 200 feet, and the angle C = $47^\\circ 30'$. And since by the rules of Plane Trigonometry,\n\n$$\\text{rad} : \\tan. BCD :: DC : DB;$$\n\nBy employing the logarithmic tables (see Logarithms), and proceeding as is taught in Plane Trigonometry, we shall find DB = 218.3 feet. To which add DA = EC = 5 feet, the height of the instrument, and we have AB = 223.3 feet, the height of the tower.\n\nEx. 2. Suppose a cloud, or balloon C, is seen at the same time by two observers at A and B, and that these stations are in the same vertical plane with the object C, and on the same side of it. Also, suppose that its angles of elevation, viz. the angles A and B, are $35^\\circ$ and $64^\\circ$, and that AB, the distance between the observers, is 880 feet. It is required hence to determine CD the height of the object, also AC, BC its distances from the two observers.\n\nIn the triangle CAB, there are given the outward angle CBD = $64^\\circ$, and one of the inward angles A = $35^\\circ$; hence the other inward angle ACB, which is their difference, is given, and $64^\\circ - 35^\\circ = 29^\\circ$.\n\nNow in the triangle CAB\n\n$$\\sin. ACB : \\sin. A :: AB : BC,$$\n\nand $\\sin. ACB : \\sin. B :: AB : AC.$\n\nFrom these proportions, by actual calculation, BC will be found = 1041 feet, and AC = 1631 feet.\n\nAgain, in the right-angled triangle BCD\n\n$$\\text{rad} : \\sin. B :: BC : CD,$$\n\nHence CD will be found = 936 feet.\n\nEx. 3. Wanting to know the breadth CD of a river, and also the distance of an object A close by its side from another object C on its opposite side, a base AB of 400 yards was measured along the bank. Then, by means of a theodolite, the angles CBA and CAB were measured, and found to be $37^\\circ 40'$ and $59^\\circ 15'$ respectively. It is required thence to determine the breadth CD, and the distance AC between the objects A and C.\n\nThis example differs from the last only by the given angles, and distances required, lying in a horizontal instead of a vertical plane.\n\nIn the triangle ABC we have the base AB, also the angles A and B, and consequently the angle C given.\n\nAnd by Plane Trigonometry,\n\n$$\\sin. ACB : \\sin. B :: AB : AC.$$\n\nHence AC is found to be 246.2 yards.\n\nAlso, in the right-angled triangle ACD,\n\n$$\\text{rad} : \\sin. A :: AC : CD.$$\n\nHence CD is found to be 211.6 yards.\n\nEx. 4. At B the top of a tower, which stood on a hill near the sea shore, the angle of depression of a ship at anchor (viz. the angle HBS), was $4^\\circ 52'$; and at R, the bottom of the tower, its depression (namely, the angle NRS) was $4^\\circ 2'$. Required AS the horizontal distance of the vessel; and also RA, the height of the bottom of the tower above the level of the sea, supposing RB the height of the tower itself to be 54 feet.\n\nFrom the angle BSA = HBS = $4^\\circ 52'$ subtract the angle RSA = NRS = $4^\\circ 2'$, and there remains the angle BSBR = $50'$. Also, from the angle HBA = $90^\\circ$ subtract HBS = $4^\\circ 52'$, and there remains SBR = $85^\\circ 8'$.\n\nIn the triangle SBR,\n\n$$\\sin. BSR : \\sin. SBR :: BR : SR;$$\n\nHence SR is found. Again, in the triangle SRA,\n\n$$\\text{rad} : \\sin. RSA :: SR : AR,$$\n\nand $$\\text{rad} : \\cos. RSA :: SR : AS.$$\n\nFrom the first of these proportions we find AR = 260 feet; and from the second, AS = 3690 feet.\n\nEx. 5. To measure the height of an obelisk CD, Fig. 6, standing on the top of a declivity, two stations at A and B were taken, one at the distance of 40, and the other at the distance of 100 feet from the centre of its base, which was in a straight line with the stations. At the nearer station A, a line drawn from it to the top of the obelisk was found to make an angle of $41^\\circ$ with the plane of the declivity; and at B, the more remote station, the like angle was found to be $23^\\circ 45'$. Hence it is required to find the height of the obelisk.\n\nFrom the angle CAD = $41^\\circ$, subtract the angle B = $23^\\circ 45'$, and there remains the angle BCA = $17^\\circ 15'$.\n\nIn the triangle BCA,\n\n$$\\sin. BCA : \\sin. B :: AB : AC.$$ Hence AC = 81.49 feet.\n\nAnd in the triangle ACD,\n\n$$AC + AD : AC - AD :: \\tan. \\frac{1}{2}(D+C) : \\tan. \\frac{1}{2}(D-C).$$\n\nHence $\\frac{1}{2}(D-C) = 42^\\circ 24'15''$, which, subtracted from $\\frac{1}{2}(D+C)$, gives the angle ACD = $27^\\circ 5'15''$.\n\nLastly, in the triangle ACD,\n\n$$\\sin. ACD : \\sin. A :: AD : DC.$$ Hence DC, the height required, will be found to be 57.62 feet.\n\nEx. 6. Wanting to know the distance between two inaccessible objects H and M, a base AB of 670 yards was measured in the same plane with the objects, and the following angles were taken at its extremities.\n\nAt A $\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{l} BAM = 40^\\circ 16' \\\\ MAH = 57^\\circ 40' \\end{array} \\right.$\n\nAt B $\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{l} ABH = 42^\\circ 22' \\\\ HBM = 71^\\circ 7' \\end{array} \\right.$\n\nHence it is required to determine HM, the distance between the objects.\n\nIn the triangle HAB we have the angle HBA = $42^\\circ 22'$, the angle HAB ($= HAM + MAB$) = $97^\\circ$.","sp":114,"ep":116},{"h":"PROBLEM II","t":"Having given any two sides of a right-angled triangle, to find the remaining side.","sp":118,"ep":118},{"h":"PROBLEM II","t":"To find the content of a cask of the second, or parabolic spindle form.","sp":130,"ep":130},{"h":"PROBLEM III","t":"To find the area of a triangle.\n\nRULE I.\n\nMultiply any one of its sides by the perpendicular let fall upon it from the opposite angle, and half the product will be the area.\n\nThe truth of this rule is proved in GEOMETRY, Sect.

The height of the whole sphere is its diameter.\n\nThe truth of this rule has been already shown in the article Fluxions, \u00a7. 165. It may however be deduced from principles more elementary, by reasoning as follows. Let PCQ be a semicircle, and ABCDE several successive sides of a regular polygon inscribed in it. Conceive the semicircle to revolve about the diameter PQ as an axis, then the arch ABCDE will generate a portion of the surface of a sphere, and the chords AB, BC, CD, &c. will generate the surfaces of frustums of cones; and it is easy to see that the number of chords may be so great that the surface which they generate shall differ from the surface generated by the arch ACE by a quantity which is less than any assigned quantity. Bisect AB in L, and draw AF, LM, BG, CH, &c. perpendicular to PQ. For the sake of brevity, let circ. AF denote the circumference of a circle whose radius is AF. Then because AF, BG, LM, are to each other respectively as circ. AF, circ. BG, circ. LM (Geom. Sect. VI. Prop. 4.), and because \\(\\frac{1}{2}(AF + BG) = LM\\), therefore \\(\\frac{1}{2}(\\text{circ. AF} + \\text{circ. BG}) = \\text{circ. LM}\\). Now the area of the surface generated by the chord AB is \\(\\frac{1}{2}(\\text{circ. AF} + \\text{circ. BG})(\\times AB)\\) (Prob. 3.) therefore the same area is also equal to \\((\\text{circ. LM}) \\times AB\\). Draw AO parallel to FG, and draw LN to the centre of the circle. Then the triangles AOB, OLM are manifestly similar; therefore \\(AB : AO :: NL : LM :: \\text{circ. NL} : \\text{circ. LM}\\); and hence \\(AO \\times \\text{circ. NL} = AB \\times \\text{circ. LM}\\). But this last quantity has been proved equal to the surface generated by AB, therefore the same surface is equal to \\(AO \\times \\text{circ. NL}\\), or to \\(FG \\times \\text{circ. NL}\\), that is, to the rectangle contained by FG and the circumference of a circle inscribed in the polygon. In the same way it may be shown that the surfaces generated by BC, CD, DE, are respectively equal to \\(GH \\times \\text{circ. LN}, HI \\times \\text{circ. LN}, IK \\times \\text{circ. LN}\\). Therefore the whole surface generated by the chords AB, BC, CD, DE, &c. is equal to \\((FG + GH + HI + IK) \\times \\text{circ. LN} = FK \\times \\text{circ. LN}\\). Conceive now the number of chords between A and E to be indefinitely increased; then, observing that the limit of the surface generated by the chords is the surface generated by the arch ABCDE, and that the limit of NL is NP, the radius of the generating circle, it follows that the spherical surface or zone generated by the arch ACE is equal to the product of the circumference of the sphere by FK the height of the zone.\n\nEx. 1.

The\nVol. XIII. Part II.\n\n(A) The story is as follows: After St Paul had made some stay at Messina (a circumstance of his travels\nunnoticed by St Luke), the Messinese prevailed upon him to return to Jerusalem with an embassy of four\npersons sent by the city to the Virgin Mary. Their excellencies were graciously received by her, and brought\nback a letter written with her own hand in the Hebrew tongue, which St Paul translated into Greek. By\nthe irruption of the Saracens this invaluable treasure was lost, and utterly forgotten till the year 1467, when\nConstantine Lascaris, a refugee Greek, found a copy of it, and turning it into Latin, made it known to the\ncitizens, and then to all the Catholic world. Its authenticity is now so well established at Messina, that Regna\nthe historian candidly acknowledges, that whoever was to confess even a doubt on the subject in that city would\nbe treated as an infidel.\n\nThis curious epistle is conceived in these terms:\u2014Maria Virgo, Joachim filia, Dei humillima Christi Jesu\ncrucifixi mater, ex tribu Iuda, stirpe David, Messianentibus omnibus salutem, et Dei Patris Omnipotentis bene-\ndictionem. Vos omnes fide magna legatos ac nuncios per publicum documentum ad nos misse comitatis. Fi-\nlium nostrum Dei genitum Deum et hominem elle fatemini, et in coelum post suam resurrectionem ascendisse,\nPauli apostoli elechi praedicatione mediante viam veritatis agnoscentes. Ob quod vos et ipsam civitatem bene-\ndicimus, cujus perpetuam protectionem nos effe volumus. Anno filii nostri XLII. Indici, I. III. Nonas Junii,\nluna XXVII. feria V. ex Hierofolymis.\n\nThus translated:\u2014\"The Virgin Mary, daughter of Joachim, most humble mother of God, Jesus Christ\ncrucified, of the tribe of Juda and the family of David, health and the blessing of God the Father Almighty\nto all the people of Messina. Out of the abundance of your faith, you have, in consequence of a public de-\nliberation, sent a deputation to me; and since you acknowledge that my Son is both God and man, and that\nhe ascended into heaven after his resurrection, as you have learned from the preaching of St Paul the apostle,\npretensions to pre-eminence over the whole island, nay over the whole world; to its virtues and patronage they attribute every piece of good fortune, and to their own unworthiness all finister events that have befallen them. The authenticity of this epistle has been seriously impugned, and of course vigorously defended by many Sicilian divines and disputators.\n\nThere is another church in this city that deserves particular notice, not so much on account of its architecture or ornaments, as for its being the last refuge of the Greek liturgy, which was once the predominant service of the island, but gradually abolished by different conquerors. It is dedicated to the Virgin Mary de Graffico, or of the Letter, which denomination may perhaps have furnished Lascaris with the idea of his letter. It is known at present by the name of la Cattolica. According to the Greek canons, the entrance of monastic churches was reciprocally forbidden to each sex, and the cathedrals were the only places of worship where a daily sacrifice was offered up by the bishop and clergy, and where both men and women were present at the same time, but in different parts of the church. From this general admittance the building acquired the title of Catholic or universal.\n\nMezzina is all paved with lava, cut into large flags of two feet square: a material which the vicinity of lavas renders it easy to procure, and which being very hard resists friction better than any other.\n\nDuring a series of ages, notwithstanding the various revolutions and calamities to which it has been exposed, this city has still maintained its original situation; while most other cities have shifted their ground more or less from the place where they were first founded. But its situation enjoys advantages which have still tempted such of its inhabitants as escaped from the ravages of war and the desolation of earthquakes, to prefer it to every other spot, however delightful or secure. It is of very ancient origin; it has been under many different races of monarchs; and its name has been repeatedly changed: it has been at different times called Zancle, Mamertina, Mezzina. Its first name Zancle, which in the old language of Sicily meant \"a fickle;\" alluding, as some authors suppose, to the form of the port; or, according to others, to the fertility of the country. Allured by the advantages of its situation, the Cumeans, a commercial and enterprising people, invaded the island and drove the Siculi from this settlement; they were in their turn overpowered by a band of Samian adventurers, who made way for a colony of citizens of Messina, and under these masters it changed its name to Mezzina. Their government was of short duration; for in the 289th year before Christ it was destroyed by the Mamertines, a warlike unprincipled nation inhabiting the south part of Bruttium. These soldiers being received into Messina on their return to Italy from Syracuse, where they had served as mercenaries in the army of Agathocles, took an opportunity of massacring the inhabitants and usurping their possessions. The city was now called Mamertina; and, in order to support themselves against the resentment of the Sicilian powers, the Mamertines implored the protection of the Romans, who, eager to extend their dominion beyond the limits of Italy, and jealous of the growing power of Carthage, made no scruple to succour these allies with a consular army. This step brought on the first Punic war. The Mamertines reaped no other fruit from the alliance but a more honourable degree of slavery; for such was the real nature of their connexion with Rome, whatever name it might be disguised under.\n\nMezzina was, however, always distinguished by particular attentions and favours from the senate; and, excepting a short period during the wars of the triumvirate, appears to have tasted all the sweets of Roman prosperity, without partaking of the bitter draughts of adversity. Its fate, in the ruin of the empire, was similar to that of the rest of Sicily. In 829 Mezzina fell into the hands of the Saracens, but obtained very honourable terms of capitulation; for half the city was left to the Christians, where they were to be governed by their own laws, and professed their own religion undisturbed. In the other resided the bey of one of the five provinces into which the Arabian conquerors had divided the island. Notwithstanding this indulgence, Mezzina was the first to cast off the yoke in 1377, when George Maniaces landed an army of Greeks and Normans on the shore of the Faro. It afterwards held out against the whole Mahometan force, till the feeble state of a distracted empire put out all hopes of assistance from Constantinople. This unfortunate city then opened its gates to the army of the caliph, and felt very severely the weight of his resentment, but it did not long groan under the yoke; for in less than 20 years Roger the Norman took it by surprise and delivered it from Mahometan oppression. During the crusade our Richard Coeur de Lion and Philip Augustus king of France wintered here in their way to Palestine; a sojourn marked by continual quarrels, conflagration, and bloodshed. The Mezzinese were particularly tardy in entering into the national conspiracy of 1282, but afterwards exceeded the rest of the insurgents in deeds of cruelty: This, and the importance of their situation, flung them out for the first objects of Charles's vengeance. He invested their city closely, and declared to openly his determination to refuse all terms whatever to the beleaguered, that they saw no hopes of safety but in an obstinate defence. Their courage, perseverance, and sufferings, were excessive; at length their strength and resources began to fail rapidly, and every circumstance seemed to denounce their speedy destruction, when Roger Lauria appeared off the harbour with the Aragonian fleet, forced the king to retire with precipitation across the\n\nI give my blessing to you and all your city, and agree to become your protectors. In the 42d year of my Son, the 1st of the Indiction, the 3d day of June, and the 27th of the moon, at Jerusalem.\"\n\nNot to dwell upon the astronomical blunders in these dates, let it suffice to observe, that Lascaris was not aware that Denis the Little, a Syrian monk in the 6th century, was the first who made use of the era that commences at our Saviour's birth.\nthe straits, and in his flight defeated and destroyed his naval armament. Robert, grandson of Charles I., also made a fruitless attack; but in the disturbed reign of Frederick III., Messina was delivered up to Louis king of Naples and his consort Queen Joan, who entered it in triumph. In a few years it returned to its former possessors. The year 1672 was remarkable for the revolt of the Messinese.\u2014They threw off the Spanish yoke, and swore allegiance to Louis XIV., king of France. They were for some time vigorously afflicted by the French; but before the Spaniards had gained the least advantage to excite any hopes of recovering so valuable a possession, Louis found himself necessitated from motives of political interest to desert his new subjects, and leave them to the mercy of their old incensed masters. The horror of being thus abandoned, and the chastisement inflicted by Spain, broke the fierce spirit of the Messinese; they were still stunned with the remembrance and effects of this blow, when the plague in 1743 was introduced from the Levant, and swept away more than half the inhabitants. From this chain of calamities, the opulence, trade, and population of Messina, have been gradually sinking; and unless very favourable circumstances happen, will every year fall lower. The number of its inhabitants does not now exceed 35,000.\n\nThe following particulars are added from M. Houel, who visited this city since the late earthquakes, which completed its destruction.\n\nOn the front of the cathedral there is a square, which, though not regular, is far from being mean. This was not the largest square in Messina before its overthrow; but it was the most elegant, the most splendidly adorned, and the best frequented. There stands in this square an equestrian statue of Charles II., of Spain, in bronze, which has been spared by the earthquake. It stands on a marble pedestal, in the middle of the square. Opposite to this statue is an elegant marble fountain, ornamented with a variety of figures, representing men and other animals, all of them spouting out water in great abundance; which used, in summer, to spread an agreeable and refreshing coolness over the square, that induced company to assemble here. Seven streets terminated here. The cathedral forms a part of the square. It is dedicated to the blest Virgin; the occasion of which has been already mentioned.\n\nThere is an anniversary feast celebrated in Messina, which is called the feast of the Letter. A lock of the Virgin's hair, which she sent to the Messenians at the same time with the letter, is carried through the city in procession in a crystal vessel. She made also a present of her picture to the Messenian deputies. It is placed over the tabernacle. None but the canons of the cathedral are permitted to touch, or take up on their shoulders, the silver shrine in which the crystal vessel with the Virgin's hair is deposited. Eight of those canons, with mitres on their heads, bear this shrine in the procession. The canopy suspended over it is supported by six senators in their robes. The picture and the hair are shown to strangers. This procession, and the other religious ceremonies of this festival, are followed by horse races. The spirits of the people being already elevated by their religious exercises, they engage with amazing eagerness in these and the other diversions with which they are accompanied: a tumultuous joy reigns over the city; and the evening concludes with illuminations and fireworks. The ships in the harbour pay the citizens the compliment of entertaining them with a discharge of their guns on the occasion.\n\nThrough a square called the Square of the Great Hospital, runs a large and impetuous torrent, the Porta delle Legni. It is precipitated from those lofty mountains which overlook this city on the south side. The channel which it has cut out for itself is at times entirely full. It would, on such occasions, overflow the square and other parts of the city, were it not confined by walls which have been built on both sides to prevent such accidents.\u2014Another stream of a similar origin, called the Torrent of La Boceta, runs through another part of the city, it is also confined within walls to prevent it from overflowing.\n\nThe Square of St John of Malta is one of the largest in Messina. In the middle of this square is a fine marble fountain, ornamented with a variety of sculptured figures and jets d'eau. Beside the fountain there used to stand a large reservoir for horses to drink out of.\n\nIn the time of the annual festivals, there used to be exhibited on the water of the reservoir a galley, or rather a fictitious representation of a galley, with galley-slaves, soldiers, officers, and a commander on board, all in arms, and the galley properly equipped as a ship of war. This galley was decorated with great art; and by night the masts, and every other suitable part, were hung with lamps, which illuminated it in a very splendid manner. Everything around was so artificially disposed, that when the fireworks were played off, the spectator was led to think, though he perceived only one galley, that the noise which he heard was produced by a naval combat; and that the other ships were concealed from his view by the smoke occasioned by the guns and fireworks. This, when properly conducted, was a noble spectacle. The festa repaired thither from the cathedral, attended with a guard and a numerous company. In one carriage sat six senators, the governor of the city, and sometimes the archbishop. It was exceedingly large, and drawn by six white horses very richly harnessed. Other carriages followed, with the train who attended the governor and the senators.\n\nAlmost all festivals owe their origin to some extraordinary event, or some singular story either true or false. It is said, that when the splendor with which the feast of the Assumption de la Bara was celebrated at Messina, first began to attract foreigners to the city, on that occasion such crowds repaired thither as to alarm the inhabitants with the fears of a famine: But one year, when the number of strangers was greater than usual at the time of this festival, the magistrates were very much at a loss how to supply them with provisions; and at length, every other resource failing, no hopes of relief remained but from the kindness of the Blest Virgin. Fervent prayers were addressed to their patroness; and next morning by day-break three brigantines appeared entering the harbour with full sails. They proved to be loaded with corn. It was eagerly purchased; and the people of the city halted to appease their hunger. But when they came after\nrefreshing themselves to pay the corn merchants their money, neither ships nor merchants could be found. After their first emotions of surprize had subsided, they naturally concluded that such a seasonable supply must undoubtedly be a present from the Virgin, who, being pleased with the zeal of her Messina votaries, and desirous to prevent the concourse of strangers who attended the festival from diminishing, had interposed in this miraculous manner to save them from the distresses of famine. A new festival was celebrated in gratitude to their generous benefactress. Three small vessels of silver were made, and dedicated to the Virgin in memory of the event; and these are at present used as lamps in the cathedral. The senate likewise decreed, that the clergy should pay annually a small tax, to be laid out in constructing a small gallery to swim on the fountain, and in defraying the expenses of the fireworks. The profits of the clergy are so considerable on the occasion of the festival, that they may be supposed to pay the tax with great cheerfulness.\n\nIn Messina, as in the other cities of Sicily, the women wrap themselves in a large black mantle above the neck of their dresses. The stuffs are richer or plainer according to rank and circumstances. People who are not rich enough to have fine clothes of their own, hire them at so much an hour. There are women who make a livelihood by lending out their clothes. The mantle covers the wearer from head to foot.\u2014It reduces the old and the young, the ill-shaped and the handsome, pretty much to an equality in point of appearance. This must naturally appear very unfavourable to the influence of beauty. But yet, on proper occasions, at church or in a public walk, the ladies of Messina find means to open and adjust the mantle so as to display all their beauties of face and shape, and to attract the affections of lovers, perhaps more powerfully than if their dresses were suited to display their charms in a more ostentatious manner.\n\nBetween Messina and the tower of Faro there stands a small church called the Madonna of the Grotto. It was anciently a temple of a round structure, and ornamented with columns like the temple of the sun at Rome. Modern columns now supply the place that was occupied by the ancient. There are large niches in the rock adjoining to the temple, which are thought to be of equal antiquity. These contain no sculptured figures; but in Pagan times they might possibly contain some.\n\nMessina being situated between Mount Etna and the gulf of Charybdis, and being likewise at no great distance from the volcanoes of Lipari and Stromboli, must have been in all ages liable to suffer by earthquakes. Such terrible events, however, appear to have been more unfrequent in ancient than in modern times, and have actually alarmed the present age oftener than any other. In the year 1693 a fourth part of the cities of Sicily was destroyed by an earthquake. Messina merely felt the shock; all its buildings, however, suffered. In the year 1742 it suffered another equally violent. A plague which followed in 1743 retarded the repairs necessary after the earthquake. In the year 1780 this city continued, for more than six months, to suffer from new earthquakes.\n\nWere the state of the elements, previous to these dreadful events, carefully examined, it might perhaps be found to undergo certain changes which might be considered as prognosticating them.\n\nThe autumn of the year 1782 was unusually cold and rainy. Fahrenheit's thermometer was often as low as 56 degrees. The succeeding winter was dry; and the mercury never fell under 25 degrees: And, what is uncommon in that season, storms were now and then observed to arise from the west. The pilots in the channel observed that the tides no longer rose at the usual periods, and the gulf of Charybdis raged with extraordinary fury.\n\nOn the 5th of February 1783, the air was heavy and calm; and the sky obscured with thick clouds, and the atmosphere seemingly all in a flame. About half after twelve at noon, the earth began to shake with a dreadful noise. The shocks continually increased, and became at length so violent as to open the ground, and to overturn in two or three minutes a considerable part of the buildings.\n\nA long white cloud appeared to the north-west; and soon after another, very dark, in the same quarter of the heavens. The latter in a moment spread over the whole horizon, and deluged the city with rain and hail, accompanied with dreadful claps of thunder. The inhabitants fled in the utmost terror to the fields and the ships in the harbour.\n\nFrom mid-day till five in the afternoon the earthquake continued almost without interruption. The shocks then became somewhat less frequent. The cries of the dying; the shrieks of those who were half buried under the ruins; the wild terror with which others, who were still able, attempted to make their escape; the despair of fathers, mothers, and husbands, bereft of those who were dearest to them; then formed altogether a scene of horror, such as can but seldom occur in the history of the calamities of the human race. Amid that awful scene, instances of the most heroic courage and the most generous affection were displayed. Mothers, regardless of their own safety, rushed into every danger to snatch their children from death. Conjugal and filial affection prompted deeds not less desperate and heroic. But no sooner did the earthquake cease, than the poor wretches who had escaped began to feel the influence of very different passions. When they returned to visit the ruins, to seek out the situation of their fallen dwellings, to inquire into the fate of their families, to procure food and collect some remains of their former fortunes\u2014such as found their circumstances the most wretched became suddenly animated with rage, which nothing but wild despair could inspire. The distinction of ranks, and the order of society were disregarded, and property eagerly violated. Murder, rapine, and lawless robbery, reigned among the smoking ruins.\n\nAbout one in the morning another shock of the earthquake was felt, which overturned most of the houses that were still standing. Most of those whom want, or avarice, or humanity, still detained among the ruins, now shared the same fate with their friends whom the former shocks had buried under them.\n\nThe succeeding day scarce alleviated the distress of this dismal night: the few wretches who still survived found themselves destitute of every necessary. At length order was in some degree re-established; and in\ntwo days after every person was supplied at least with some small portion of the necessaries for subsistence.\n\nNone yet thought of returning to take up their abode among the ruins. The common people fixed their residence on the plain of Porto Salvo, near the town of Salico. The nobles, magistrates, and merchants, took up their abode on another plain, on the other side of the stream Porto de Legno; the soldiers at Terra Nuova.\n\nSome violent shocks which were again felt on the 7th of February and the 28th of March completed the destruction of the city. The corn magazines, however, escaped without damage; and the public ovens and the aqueducts were but little injured. From these facts it may perhaps be inferred, that had not the houses of Messina been, in general, hastily built at the first, and afterwards carelessly repaired, fewer of them would have been overthrown by the earthquake.\n\nThe neighbouring villages having suffered but little, were the first to relieve the remaining inhabitants of Messina in their distresses. Maltese galleys for some days supplied necessaries to the poor and the sick with a generosity which merits the highest praise. They brought surgeons and whatever was needful for the cure of the wounded. The supplies sent by the king of France were refused, for what reason we know not. What money was needed for the support of the people was taken from the treasury of the city of Messina; for what the king of Naples sent was seized and spent by the garrison.\n\nIt is said that not more than 800 or 900 persons perished by this earthquake. The sea during that convulsion of the land was slightly agitated in the harbour. Farther out the sea was more violently agitated; but none of the ships in the harbour were dashed to pieces. The waters rose so high as to be injurious in a very considerable degree to Pharos, as well as along the coast of Sicily and Bagnara.\n\nThis earthquake was not of a momentary duration, like that by which Lithon was destroyed, and like many others; for more than sixty days, from the 5th of February to the beginning of April, Messina continued to be shaken, and in that time felt more than 200 shocks; and even after that period the alarm was again and again renewed. Not only the magistrates, the soldiers, and the people, but the priests likewise, with their tabernacle and altar, retired to the barracks. The nuns, too, deserted their cloisters, and sought a retreat without the walls. Some of them confined themselves to the gardens of their convents; others mixed indiscriminately with the people.\n\nThe chief damage which the public buildings within the city suffered was the fall of the dome of the church of Purgatory. Only the walls were left standing; and even these had suffered considerably. One half of the steeple of the cathedral was beaten to the ground. The magazines of Porto Franco were likewise very much shattered. The fort of St Salvator, being built on an artificial foundation, the side next the sea is there fallen down; but on the other side, where it is founded on a rock, it has stood unmoved by all the shocks of the earthquake.\n\nOn the 5th of February, when the earthquake was more violent than at any time afterwards, a strong smell of sulphur was felt. The earth was affected somewhat in the same way as if it had been borne up on a fluid; and seemed to reel with the shocks much like a ship tossed with the waves. This tremulous motion was felt all over Sicily; but towards Pharos it became weaker. On the following days the sky was cloudy; the mountains of Sicily and the shores of Calabria continued covered with a thick fog like smoke. North and north-east winds raged with the most violent impetuosity.\n\nThe disastrous year of this earthquake was scarce concluded, the chasms which it had opened in the ground were still yawning, and the poor inhabitants of the adjacent country still trembled with terror, when the elements again renewed their fury to ravage this miserable land.\n\nOn Tuesday the 6th of January 1784, about sunrise, the wind began to blow softly from the north-east. The sea gradually swelled, rose beyond its bed with rapid impetuosity, overflowed the quay of Messina, and lashed with its billows the ruins of the Palazzata. It loosened and displaced many of the stones of the mole, spread over the whole street, and attacked the pedestals of the statues which had been spared by the earthquake, and still stood firm among the ruins. The same furious wind which swelled the sea in so extraordinary a manner, ravaged the whole coast from Messina all the way to Syracuse.","sp":153,"ep":157},{"h":"RULE","t":"1.

But it is impossible to express exactly, by finite numbers, the proportion of the diameter of the circle to its circumference.\n\n*Example.* 1.

Required the length of the arch AEB, whose chord AB is 6, the radius AC or CB being 9. Draw CD perpendicular to the chord, then CD will bisect the chord in D, and the arch in E. Now in the right-angled triangle ACD, there is given the hypotenuse AC = 9, and the side AD = 3; hence, by trigonometry, the angle ACE will be found to contain $19^\\circ 28' \\frac{7}{9}$ = 19.471 degrees. The double of this, or 38.942, is the number of degrees in the whole arch AEB. Then by the rule\n\n$$\\frac{180}{38.942} : 9 \\times 3.1416 : 9 \\times 3.1416 \\times 38.942 = 6.11701$$\n\nis the answer.\n\nRule II.\n\nFrom 8 times the chord of half the arch subtract the chord of the whole arch, and $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the remainder will be the length of the arch nearly.\n\nThis rule may be demonstrated briefly thus. Let $a$ denote an arch of a circle; then from the series expressing the sine of an arch in terms of the arch, (see Fluxions, \u00a7 70. Ex. 3, also Trigonometry) we have, putting rad. = 1,\n\n$$\\sin \\frac{1}{2} a = \\frac{1}{2} a - \\frac{a^3}{48} + \\frac{a^5}{3840} - \\&c.$$  \n\nTherefore, if the arch $a$ be small, so that $a^3$ is a very small quantity, then\n\n$$\\sin \\frac{1}{2} a = \\frac{1}{2} a - \\frac{a^3}{48} \\text{ nearly.}$$\n\nIn like manner we have\n\n$$\\sin \\frac{1}{2} a = \\frac{1}{2} a - \\frac{a^3}{384} \\text{ nearly.}$$\n\nBy means of the two last equations eliminate the quantity $a^3$, and the resulting equation is\n\n$$16 \\sin \\frac{1}{2} a - 2 \\sin \\frac{1}{2} a = 3 a.$$  \n\nBut $16 \\sin \\frac{1}{2} a = 8 \\text{ chord } \\frac{1}{2} a$, and $2 \\sin \\frac{1}{2} a = \\text{ chord } a$. Therefore 8 chord $\\frac{1}{2} a$ \u2014 chord $a = 3 a$.\n\nHere we have supposed the radius of the circle to be unity; but the same must evidently be true, whatever be the radius of the circle.\n\nExample. Suppose as before, that the chord AB is 6, and the radius AC is 9. Then CD = $\\sqrt{(CA^2 - AD^2)} = \\sqrt{72} = 8.4852814$, and DE = $9 - 8.4852814 = 0.5147186$, and hence AE = $\\sqrt{(AD^2 + DE^2)} = 3.043836$.\n\nThen by the rule\n\n$$\\frac{3.043836 \\times 8 - 6}{3} = 6.116896$$\n\nis the length of the arch, nearly the same as before.\n\nProblem X.\n\nTo find the area of a circle.\n\nRule I.\n\nMultiply half the circumference by half the diameter, and the product will be the area.\n\nRule II.\n\nMultiply the square of the diameter by .7854, and the product will be the area.\n\nThe first of these rules has been demonstrated in Geometry, Sect. VI. Prop. 3. And the second rule is deduced from the first, as follows. It appears from Prop. 6, Sect. VI. Geometry, that the diameter of a circle being unity, its circumference is 3.1416 nearly; therefore, by the first rule, its area is $1 \\times 3.1416 \\div 4 = .7854$. But circles are to one another as the squares of their diameters, (Prop. 4.) therefore, putting $d$ for the diameter of any circle, $1 : d^2 :: .7844 : .7854 d^2$ = the area of the circle whose diameter is $d$.\n\nExample. What is the area of a circle whose diameter is 7?\n\nBy the second rule $7 \\times 7 \\times .7854 = 38.4846$ the area.\n\nBy the first rule $7 \\times 3.1416 =$ the circumference.\n\nThen $\\frac{7 \\times 3.1416 \\times 7}{4} = 7 \\times 7 \\times .7854$ the area, the same as before.\n\nProblem XI.\n\nTo find the area of any sector of a circle.\n\nRule I.\n\nMultiply the radius by half the arch of the sector, and the product will be the area, as in the whole circle.\n\nRule II.\n\nAs 360 is to the degrees in the arc of the sector, so is the area of the whole circle to the area of the sector.\n\nThe first of these rules follows easily from the rule for the whole area, by considering that the whole circumference is to the arch of the sector, as the whole area to the area of the sector, that is,\n\n$$\\text{circum.} :: \\text{arch of sect.} :: \\text{rad.} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\text{circum.} :: \\text{area of sect.}$$\n\nHence area of sect. = rad. $\\times \\frac{1}{2}$ arch of sect.\n\nThe second rule is too obvious to need any formal proof.\n\nExample.

Dr Heberden gives a very accurate account of the symptoms produced by the acarides, from an eminent physician who was troubled with them all his life. They brought on an uneasiness in the rectum, and an almost intolerable itching in the anus; which sensations most usually came on in the evening, and prevented sleep for several hours. They were attended with heat, sometimes so considerable as to produce a swelling in the rectum both\nboth internally and externally; and if these symptoms were not soon relieved, a tenesmus was brought on, with a mucous dejection. Sometimes there was a gripping pain in the lower part of the abdomen, a little above the os pubis. If this pain was very severe, a bloody mucus followed, in which there were often found acarides alive. They were also sometimes suspected of occasioning disturbed sleep, and some degree of headache.\n\nOn this case Dr Heberden observes, that the general health of the patient did not seem to have suffered from the long continuance of the disease, nor the immediate inconveniences of the disorder itself to have increased. \"It is (says he) perhaps universally true, that this kind of worms, though as difficult to be cured as any, yet is the least dangerous of all. They have been known to accompany a person through the whole of a long life, without any reason to suspect that they had halved its end. As in this case there was no remarkable sickness, indigestion, giddiness, pain of the stomach, nor itching of the nose, possibly these symptoms, where they have happened to be joined with the acarides, did not properly belong to them, but arose from some other causes. There is indeed no one sign of these worms, but what in some patients will be wanting.\"\n\nThe above mentioned patient used purging and irritating clysters with very little success. One dram and an half of tobacco was infused in six ounces of boiling water; and the strained liquor being given as a clyster, occasioned a violent pain in the lower part of the abdomen, with faintness and a cold sweat: this injection, though retained only one minute, acted as a smart purge, but did little or no good. Lime-water was also used as a clyster; which brought on a catarrh, but had no good effect. Six grains of salt of steel were dissolved in six ounces of water, and injected. This clyster in a few minutes occasioned an aching in the rectum, gripped a little without purging, and excited a tenesmus. Some few acarides were brought off with it; but all of them were alive. The uneasy sensation in the rectum did not abate till some warm milk was thrown up. Whenever the tenesmus or mucous stools were thought worth the taking notice of, warm milk and oil generally gave immediate relief. If purging was necessary, the lenient purges, such as manna with oil, were, in this particular case, made use of: rhubarb was found too stimulating.\u2014But, in general, the most useful purge, and which therefore was most usually taken, was cinnamon and rhubarb, of each half a drachm: this powder seldom failed to bring away a mucus as transparent as the white of an egg, and in this many acarides were moving about. The cinnamon frequently adhered to this mucus, which did not come off in large quantities, when a purge was taken without cinnamon. Calomel did no more than any other purge which operates briskly would have done; that is, it brought away acarides, with a great deal of mucus. Oil given as a clyster sometimes brought off the animalcules: the oil swam on the surface of the mucus, and the acarides were alive and moving in the mucus itself, which probably hindered the oil from coming in contact with them and killing them.\n\nDr Heberden also observes, that mucus or slime is the proper nest of the acarides, in which they live, and is perhaps the food by which they are nourished; and it is this mucus which preserves them unhurt, though surrounded with many other liquors, the immediate touch of which would be fatal. It is hard to satisfy ourselves by what instinct they find it out in the human body, and by what means they get at it; but it is observable in many other parts of nature, as well as here, that where there is a fit soil for the hatching and growth of animals and vegetables, nature has taken sufficient care that their seeds should find the way thither. Worms are said to have been found in the intestines of still-born infants. Purges, by lessening this time, never fail to relieve the patient; and it is not unlikely, that the worms which are not forced away by this quickened motion of the intestines, may, for want of a proper quantity of it, languish, and at last die; for if the acarides are taken out of their mucus, and exposed to the open air, they become motionless, and apparently die in a very short time. Dr Heberden supposes that the kind of purge made use of is of some consequence in the cure of all other worms as well as acarides; the animals being always defended by the mucus from the immediate action of medicines; and that therefore those purges are the best which act briskly, and of which a repetition can be most easily borne. Purging waters are of this sort, and jalap especially for children; two or more grains of which, mixed with sugar, are most easily taken, and may be repeated daily.\n\nFrom Dr Heberden's observations, we may easily see why it is so difficult to destroy these animals; and why anthelmintics, greatly celebrated for some kinds, are yet far from being specifics in the disease. As the worms which reside in the cavities of the human body are never exposed to the air, by which all living creatures are invigorated, it is evident, that in themselves they must be the most tender and easily destructible creatures imaginable, and much less will be requisite to kill them than any of our common insects. The most pernicious substances to any of the common insects are oil, caustic fixed alkali, lime, and lime-water. The oil operates upon them by shutting up the pores of their bodies; the lime-water, lime, and caustic alkali, by dissolving their very substance. In the case of intestinal worms, however, the oil can have very little effect upon them, as they are defended from it by the moisture and mucus of the intestines; the like happens with lime-water: and therefore it is necessary that the medicine should be of such a nature as to destroy both mucus and insects together; for which purpose the caustic fixed alkali is at once safe and efficacious; nor is it probable that any case of worms whatever could resist the proper use of this medicine. A very large dose of any salt indeed will also destroy the mucus and destroy the worms; but it is apt to inflame and excoriate the stomach and intestines, and thus to produce worse distempers than that which it was intended to cure. Dr Heberden gives the following remarkable case of a patient cured of worms by enormous doses of common salt, after trying many other remedies in vain. In February 1757, the patient was seized with uncommon pains in his stomach, attended with nausea, vomiting, and constipation of bowels, and an almost total loss of sleep and appetite:\nWorms. He soon became much emaciated, and could neither stand nor walk upright; his belly grew small and hard, and closely retracted, insomuch that the sternum covered the navel, and the latter could scarce be discovered or felt by the finger: his urine was always milky, and soon deposited a thick white sediment; his excrements were very hard and lumpy, resembling those of sheep, only of a brown colour; nor had he ever a stool without some medicine or other to procure it. In this situation he continued four years; during which time he had been in an infirmary, attended by eminent physicians, but was disguised as incurable. At last he was advised by a neighbour to drink salt and water, as he said he knew one cured by it who had for many years been afflicted with the same kind of pains in the belly and stomach. As his distemper was now almost inapplicable, he willingly tried the experiment. Two pounds of common salt were dissolved in as little water as possible, all which he drank in less than an hour. Soon afterwards he found himself greatly oppressed at the stomach, grew extremely sick, and vomited violently; on the fourth straining he brought up about half a pint of small worms, part acariides, and the rest resembling those worms which are called the botus, and frequently met with in the stomach of horses, but much smaller, and about the size of a grain of wheat. The salt soon began to operate downwards, and he had five or six very copious fetid stools, tinged with blood; and in them discharged near an equal quantity of the same kind of worms he had vomited. Being greatly fatigued with the violence of the operations, he fell into a calm sleep, which lasted two hours, during which he sweated profusely, and awoke much refreshed. Instead of his usual pains, he now only complained of a rawness and soreness of his gullet, stomach, and bowels, with an almost unquenchable thirst; to allay which, he drank large quantities of cold water, whey, butter-milk, or whatever he could get. The urine he now passed was small in quantity, and rendered with very great difficulty, being highly saturated with the salt, from whence arose a most troublesome dysuria and strangury. However, these symptoms gradually abated by a free use of the liquors above-mentioned; and on the third morning he was so well recovered, that he took two pounds more of salt, dissolved in the like quantity of water. The effects were nearly similar to the former; only that most of the worms were now burnt, and came away with a considerable quantity of lime and mucus. The drought, strangury, &c. returned with their former violence, but soon yielded to the old treatment. He sweated very copiously for three days, slept easily, and by that time could extend his body freely: on the fifth day he left his bed, and, though very weak, could walk upright; his strength and appetite soon returned, and he became robust and well.\n\nThe anthelmintic medicines which have been recommended by one person or other, are in a manner innumerable; but the principal are,\n\n1. Quicksilver. This is very efficacious against all kinds of worms, either taken in the form of calomel or corrosive sublimate. Even the crude metal boiled in water, and the water drunk, has been recommended as an almost certain cure. But this, it is evident, can receive no impregnation from the mercury. If, therefore, it have any effect, it must be from some foreign and accidental impregnation. In most instances there can be no objection to mercury, but only that it is not endowed with any attenuating quality whereby the mucus in which these insects resides can be dissolved. It therefore fails in many cases, though it will most certainly destroy worms where it can get at them.\n\n2. Powder of tin. This was for some time celebrated as a specific, and indeed we may reasonably expect good effects from it; as by its weight and grittiness it rubs off the mucus and worms it contains from the coats of the intestinal canal, in which case they are easily evacuated by purgatives. In order to produce any considerable effects, it must be given in a large dose.\n\n3. Geoffroa incrustis, or cabbage bark. This remedy is used by the inhabitants of Jamaica. The first account of it which appeared in this country was published in the Physical and Literary Essays, vol. ii., by Mr Duguid surgeon in that island. He acquaints us, that the inhabitants of Jamaica, young and old, white and black, are much infested with worms, especially the long round sort; the reason of which, he thinks, is the quantity of sweet viscid vegetables which they eat. On dissecting a child of seven months old, who died of vomiting and convulsions, twelve large worms were found; one of them filled the appendix vermiformis, and three of them were entwined in such a manner as to block up the valvula Tulpia, so that nothing could pass from the small to the great guts.\u2014The cabbage bark, however, he tells us, is a safe and effectual remedy, and the most powerful vermifuge yet known; and that it frequently brings away as many worms by stool as would fill a large hat. He owns that it has sometimes violent effects; but this he attributes to the negroes who make the decoction (in which form the bark is used) too strong, and not to the remedy itself.\n\nMr Anderson, surgeon in Edinburgh, has also given an account of this bark and its operation, in a letter to Dr Duncan, published in the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries, volume iv. p. 84. From this account it appears, that there are two different kinds of cabbage bark; the one much paler than the other: the pale kind operates much more violently than the other. It often occasions loose stools, great nausea, and such like symptoms, attended with great uneasiness in the belly: in one or two instances it was suspected of inducing syncope. The darker coloured kind resembles the calca lignea, though it is of a much coarser texture. This kind, Mr Anderson thinks, may be exhibited in any case where an anthelmintic is necessary; the dangerous symptoms might have followed either from the use of the first kind, or from an over-dose of the second. The usual method of preparing the medicine is by boiling two ounces and a half of the bark in two quarts of water to a pint and a half. Of this a tea-spoonful may be given at first in the morning, gradually increasing the quantity till we come to four or five table-spoonfuls in a day. When exhibited in this manner, Mr Anderson informs us, that he never saw it produce any violent symptoms, and has experienced the best effects from it as an anthelmintic. After the use of this decoction for eight\nor nine mornings successively, a dose of jalap with calomel must be given, which seldom fails to bring away the worms, some dead, some alive. If at any time the decoction produce more than one or two loose stools, a few drops of liquid laudanum may be given; and, in general, Mr Anderson gave 15 or 20 drops of the spirit of lavender with each dose.\n\nIn a letter from Dr Ruth, professor of chemistry at Philadelphia, to Dr Duncan of Edinburgh, the following account is given of another preparation of this medicine. \"It has long (says he) been a complaint among physicians, that we have no vermicide medicine which can be depended upon. Even calomel fails in many cases where there are the most pathognomonic signs of worms in the bowels. But this complaint, it is hoped, is now at an end. The physicians of Jamaica have lately found, that the cabbage bark, as it is called in the West Indies, made into a syrup with brown sugar, is an infallible antidote to them. I have used above 30 pounds of it, and have never found it fail in one instance. The syrup is pleasant; it sometimes pukes, and always purges, the first or second time it is given.\"\n\nThe most accurate botanical description of the geoffreana inermis, or the tree furnishing the worm bark, as it has often been called, is that which was published some years ago in the Philosophical Transactions by Dr Wright, formerly physician at Jamaica, now of Edinburgh, who also highly extols this remedy as an anthelmintic.\n\nNotwithstanding these encomiums, however, the cabbage bark has not come into general use in Britain. But diseases from the tereter, or lumbrici as they are often called, the species of worm against which this bark is employed, much less frequently occur in Britain than in some other countries. When they do occur, in almost every instance they readily yield to more gentle and safe anthelmintics; and the worms may not only be expelled by calomel, but by the vegetable bitters; as the powder of the artemisia fantonica, or the like.\n\n4. Couhage, or cow itch. This is the Dolichos serus or pruriens of Linn\u00e6us; and the principles on which it acts have been already explained under the article Dolichos. It is somewhat similar to the powder of tin, but bids fair for being more efficacious. It might at first appear to occur as objections to this medicine, that by the hairs of it entangling themselves with one another, calculi might be formed in the intestines, or obstructions equally bad; or if the sharp points and hooks with which it abounds were to adhere to the nervous coats of the intestines themselves, they might occasion a fatal irritation, which could not be removed by any means whatever. But from the experience of those who have employed it extensively in practice, it would appear, that these objections are entirely theoretical; and that it may be employed with perfect safety. The episcule, gently scraped off from a single pod, and mixed with syrup or molasses, are taken for a dose in the morning fasting. This dose is repeated in this manner for two or three days without any sensible operation; but even a very slight purgative taken afterwards has been found to discharge an almost incredible quantity of worms. And according to Dr Bancroft, who has given a very particular account of its use in his Natural History of Guiana, it is one of the safest and most certain anthelmintics yet discovered; but, as well as the bark of the Geoffrea, it has hitherto been very little used in Britain, probably from its not being necessary.\n\n5. Indian pink. This plant, which is the Spigelia marilandica of Linn\u00e6us, is also an American plant, and was first recommended in the Edinburgh Physical and Literary Essays by Dr Gardiner of Charlestown in South Carolina. He is of opinion that a vomit ought always to precede the use of it; and informs us, that half a dram of it purges as briskly as the same quantity of rhubarb. At other times he has known it produce no effect on the belly though given in very large quantity: In such cases it becomes necessary to add a grain or two of sweet mercury, or some grains of rhubarb; but then it is less efficacious than when it proves purgative without addition. The use of it, however, in small doses, is by no means safe; as it frequently produces giddiness, dimness of sight, convulsions, &c. The addition of a purgative, indeed, prevents these effects; but at the same time, as already observed, it diminishes the virtue of the medicine. The doctor therefore recommends large doses, as from them he never knew any other effect than the medicine's proving emetic or violently cathartic. The dose is from 12 to 60 or 70 grains of the root in substance, or two, three, or four drams of the infusion, twice a day. This medicine has also had its day, and is now very far from being considered as a specific.\n\nThe long round worms seem to be the most dangerous which infest the human body, as they often pierce through the stomach and intestines, and thus bring on a miserable death. The common symptoms of them are nausea, vomiting, looseness, fainting, slender intermittent pulse, itching of the nose, and epileptic fits. By the consumption of the chyle they produce hunger, paleness, weakness, coliciveness, tumor of the abdomen, eructations, and rumbling of the intestines; but it is from the perforation of the intestines that the disease proves so frequently fatal. A child may be known to have worms from his cold temperament, paleness of the countenance, livid eyelids, hollow eyes, itching of the nose, voracity, startings, and grinding of the teeth, in sleep; and more especially by a very fetid breath. Very frequently, however, they are voided by the mouth and anus, in which case there is no room for doubt. In the Medical Commentaries, vol. ii., we have an account of the intestines being perforated by a worm, and yet the patient recovered. The patient was a woman troubled with an inflammation in the lower part of the abdomen. The pain was so violent, that for six days she slept none at all; the tumor then broke, discharged upwards of a pound of thin watery faeces, immediately after which the excrements followed. The next day she was extremely low; her pulse could scarcely be felt; the extremities were cold; and there was a considerable discharge from the wound, which had already begun to mortify. She got a decoction of cinchona with wine, which alleviated the symptoms; but in removing the mortified parts a worm was found among them nine inches long, and as thick as an eagle's quill. By proper applications, the discharge of excrements ceased, and she recovered perfect health. She was sensible of no accident giving rise to the\nAppendix.","sp":71,"ep":75}]
