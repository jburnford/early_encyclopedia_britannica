The mitred abbots were invested with episcopal authority within their own limits, independent of the bishop; but the others were subject to the diocesean in all spiritual government.

The old town was formerly the seat of the bishop, and had a large cathedral church, commonly called St Machar's. This cathedral had anciently two rows of stone pillars across the church, and three turrets; the steeple, which was the largest of these turrets, rested upon an arch, supported by four pillars. In this cathedral there was a fine library; but about the year 1560 it was almost totally destroyed.\n\nBut the capital building is the King's college, on the south side of the town, which is a large and statelike fabric. The steeple is vaulted with a double cross arch, above which is an imperial crown, supported by eight stone pillars, and closed with a globe and two gilded crosses. In the year 1621 this steeple was thrown down by a storm, but was soon after rebuilt in a more statelike form. This college was founded by Bishop Elphinston in the year 1500; but James IV claimed the patronage of it, and it has since been called the King's College. This college, and the Marischal-college in the new town, form one university, called the University of King Charles.\n\nThe new town is the capital of the shire of Aberdeen. For largeness, trade, and beauty, it greatly exceeds any town in the North. It stands upon a hill or rising ground. The buildings are generally four stories high, and have, for the most part, gardens behind them, which gives it a beautiful appearance. On the high street is a large church, which formerly belonged to the Franciscans. This church was begun by Bp William Elphinston, and finished by Gavin Dunbar, Bishop of Aberdeen, about the 1500. Bp Dunbar is said likewise to have built the bridge over the Dee, which consists of seven arches. The chief public building in the new town is the Marischal-college, founded by George Keith Earl of Marshall, in the year 1593; but has since been greatly augmented with additional buildings. In both the Marischal and King's college, the languages, mathematics, natural philosophy, divinity, &c., are taught by very able professors.","sp":18,"ep":18},{"h":"ABERDOUR","t":"a small town in Fife-shire, Scotland, on the frith of Forth, about ten miles N.W. of Edinburgh.","sp":18,"ep":18},{"h":"ABEREVOIR","t":"a term in masonry, expressive of certain indentures made in the joints or beds of stones, which being filled with the cement or mortar, bind them firmer together.\n\nABBEROCHMENT.

This talent is peculiarly necessary in the present state of literature; for many writers have acquired the dexterity of spreading a few critical thoughts over several hundred pages. When an author hits upon a thought that pleases him, he is apt to dwell upon it, to view it in different lights, to force it in improperly, or upon the slightest relations. Though this may be pleasant to the writer, it tires and vexes the reader. There is another great source of diffusion in composition. It is a capital object with an author, whatever be the subject, to give vent to all his best thoughts. When he finds a proper place for any of them, he is peculiarly happy. But, rather than sacrifice a thought he is fond of, he forces it in by way of digression, or superfluous illustration. If none of these expedients answer his purpose, he has recourse to the margin, a very convenient apartment for all manner of pedantry and impertinence. There is not an author, however correct, but is more or less faulty in this respect. An abridger, however, is not subject to these temptations. The thoughts are not his own; he views them in a cooler and less affectionate manner; he discovers an impropriety in some, a vanity in others, and a want of utility in many. His business, therefore, is to retrench superfluities, digressions, quotations, pedantry, &c., and to lay before the public only what is really useful. This is by no means an easy employment: To abridge some books, requires talents equal, if not superior, to those of the author. The facts, manner, spirit, and reasoning, must be preserved; nothing essential, either in argument or illustration, ought to be omitted. The difficulty of the task is the principal reason why we have so few good abridgements: Wynne's abridgement of Locke's Essay on the Human Understanding is, perhaps, the only unexceptionable one in our language.\n\nThese observations relate solely to such abridgements as are designed for the public. But,\n\nWhen a person wants to set down the substance of any book, a shorter and less laborious method may be followed. It would be foreign to our plan to give examples of abridgements for the public: But, as it may be useful, especially to young people, to know how to abridge books for their own use, after giving a few directions, we shall exhibit an example or two, to show with what ease it may be done.\n\nRead the book carefully; endeavour to learn the principal view of the author; attend to the arguments employed: When you have done so, you will generally find, that what the author uses as new or additional arguments, are in reality only collateral ones, or extensions of the principal argument. Take a piece of paper, or a common-place book, put down what the author wants to prove, subjoin the argument or arguments, and you have the substance of the book in a few lines. For example,\n\nIn the Essay on Miracles, Mr Hume's design is to prove, That miracles which have not been the immediate objects of our senses, cannot reasonably be believed upon the testimony of others.\n\nNow, his argument, (for there happens to be but one), is,\n\n\"That experience, which in some things is variable, in others uniform, is our only guide in reasoning concerning matters of fact. A variable experience gives rise to probability only; an uniform experience amounts to a proof. Our belief of any fact from the testimony of eye-witnesses, is derived from no other principle than our experience in the veracity of human testimony. If the fact attested be miraculous, here arises a contest of two opposite experiences, or proof against proof.\n\nNow, a miracle is a violation of the laws of nature; and as a firm and unalterable experience has established these laws, the proof against a miracle, from the very nature of the fact, is as complete as any argument from experience can possibly be imagined; and if so, it is an undeniable consequence, that it cannot be surmounted by any proof whatever derived from human testimony.\"\n\nIn Dr Campbell's Dissertation on Miracles, the author's principal aim is to shew the fallacy of Mr Hume's argument; which he has done most successfully by another single argument, as follows:\n\n\"The evidence arising from human testimony is not solely derived from experience: on the contrary, testimony hath a natural influence on belief antecedent to experience. The early and unlimited assent given to testimony by children gradually contracts as they advance in life: it is, therefore, more consonant to truth, to say, that our diffidence in testimony is the result of experience, than that our faith in it has this foundation. Besides, the uniformity of experience, in favour of any fact, is not a proof against its being reversed in a particular instance. The evidence arising from the single testimony of a man of known veracity will go far to establish...\"\nestablish a belief in its being actually reversed: If his testimony be confirmed by a few others of the same character, we cannot withhold our assent to the truth of it. Now, though the operations of nature are governed by uniform laws, and though we have not the testimony of our senses in favour of any violation of them, still, if, in particular instances, we have the testimony of thousands of our fellow-creatures, and those too men of strict integrity, swayed by no motives of ambition or interest, and governed by the principles of common sense, that they were actually eye-witnesses of these violations, the constitution of our nature obliges us to believe them.\n\nThese two examples contain the substance of about 400 pages.\u2014Making private abridgements of this kind has many advantages; it engages us to read with accuracy and attention; it fixes the subject in our minds; and, if we should happen to forget, instead of reading the books again, by glancing at a few lines, we are not only in possession of the chief arguments, but recall in a good measure the author's method and manner.\n\nAbridging is peculiarly useful in taking the substance of what is delivered by Professors, &c. It is impossible, even with the assistance of short-hand, to take down, verbatim, what is said by a public speaker. Besides, although it were practicable, such a talent would be of little use. Every public speaker has circumlocutions, redundancies, lumber, which deserve not to be copied. All that is really useful may be comprehended in a short compass. If the plan of the discourse, and arguments employed in support of the different branches be taken down, you have the whole. These you may afterwards extend in the form of a discourse drafted in your own language. This would not only be a more rational employment, but would likewise be an excellent method of improving young men in composition, an object too little attended to in all our universities. Besides, it would be more for the honour of professors; as it would prevent at least such immense loads of disjointed and unintelligible rubbish from being handed about by the name of such a man's lectures.","sp":20,"ep":21},{"h":"ABRIDGEMENT","t":"in law, signifies the making a declaration or plaint shorter by leaving out something.","sp":21,"ep":21},{"h":"ABROLKOS","t":"the name of certain shelves, or banks of sand, about 20 leagues from the coast of Brazil.","sp":21,"ep":21},{"h":"ABRON","t":"a river of France which falls into the Loire not far from Nevers.\n\nABRONO.

See Academy in the modern sense.","sp":23,"ep":23},{"h":"ACADEMICS","t":"or Academists, a denomination given to the cultivators of a species of philosophy originally derived from Socrates, and afterwards illustrated and enforced by Plato, who taught in a grove near Athens, consecrated to the memory of Academus an Athenian hero; from which circumstance this philosophy received the name of academical. Before the days of Plato, philosophy had, in a great measure, fallen into contempt. The contradictory systems and hypotheses that had successively been urged upon the world, were become so numerous, that, from a view of this inconstancy and uncertainty of human opinions, many were led to conclude, that truth lay beyond the reach of our comprehension. Absolute and universal scepticism was the natural consequence of this conclusion. In order to remedy this abuse of philosophy and of the human faculties, Plato laid hold of the principles of the academical philosophy, and, in his Phaedo, reasons in the following manner: \"If we are unable to discover truth, (says he), it must be owing to two circumstances; either there is no truth in the nature of things, or the mind, from a defect in its powers, is not able to apprehend it. Upon the latter supposition, all the uncertainty and fluctuation in the opinions and judgments of mankind admit of an easy solution: Let us therefore be modest, and ascribe our errors to the real weakness of our own minds, and not to the nature of things themselves. Truth is often difficult of access; in order to come at it, we must proceed with caution and diffidence, carefully examining every step; and after all our labour, we will frequently find our greatest efforts disappointed, and be obliged to confess our ignorance and weakness.\"\n\nLabour and caution in our researches, in opposition to rash and hasty decisions, were the distinguishing characteristics of the disciples of the ancient academy. A philosopher possessed of these principles, will be slow in his progress, but will seldom fall into errors, or have occasion to alter his opinion after it is once formed. Vanity and precipitance are the great sources of scepticism: hurried on by these, instead of attending to the cool and deliberate principles recommended by the academy, several of our modern philosophers have plunged themselves into an absurd and ridiculous kind of scepticism. They pretend to discredit things that are plain, simple, and easily comprehended; but give peremptory and decisive judgments upon subjects that evidently exceed the limits of our capacity. Of these Berkeley and Hume are the most considerable. Berkeley denied the existence of every thing, excepting his own ideas. Mr Hume has gone a step further, and questioned even the existence of ideas; but at the same time has not hesitated to give determined opinions with regard to eternity, providence, and a future state, miraculous interpolations of the Deity, &c., subjects far above the reach of our faculties. In his essay on the academical or sceptical philosophy, he has confounded two very opposite species of philosophy. After the days of Plato, indeed, the principles of the first academy were grossly corrupted by Arcesilas, Carneades, &c. This might lead Mr Hume into the notion that the academical and sceptical philosophy were synonymous terms. But no principles can be of a more opposite nature than...\nthan those which were inculcated by the old academy of Socrates and Plato, and the sceptical notions which were propagated by Arcesilas, Carneades, and the other disciples of the succeeding academics.\n\nAcademy, in antiquity, a garden or villa, situated within a mile of Athens, where Plato and his followers held their philosophical conferences. It took its name from one Academus, or Eacademus, a citizen of Athens, who was the original owner of it, and made it a kind of gymnasion: he lived in the time of Theseus. Cimon embellished it with fountains, trees, and walks; but Sylla, during the siege of Athens, employed these very trees in making battering-engines against the city. Cicero too had his villa, or place of retirement, near Puzzuoli, which he also named an academy, where he composed his Academical questions, and his book De natura deorum.\n\nAcademy, among the moderns, is most commonly used to signify a society of learned men, established for the improvement of any art or science. Charlemagne was the first that established an academy in Europe. Most nations have since followed his example; but Italy has by far the greatest number. In the cities of Piedmont, Ferrara, and Milan, Jareckius reckons 550. We have but few in Britain. In England those of note are, the Royal Society, the Antiquarian Society, Society for the encouragement of arts, and the Academy of Painting; in Scotland, the Edinburgh Society, College of Physicians, and Musical Society; all which see in their proper places.\n\nThe French have several academies; as, the Royal Academy of Sciences, for the improvement of physics, mathematics, and chemistry. It was first instituted in 1666, by the assistance of Mr Colbert, comptroller-general of the finances, but was not confirmed by the French king till the year 1696, who, by a regulation dated the 26th of January, new-modelled and put it on a better footing. According to this regulation, the academy was to be composed of ten honorary academicians, eight strangers associates, twenty pensionaries fellows, twenty eleves or scholars, and twelve French associates; these were to be divided into six classes, viz. geometricians, astronomers, mechanics, anatomists, chemists, and botanists; the honorary academists to be all inhabitants of France, the pensionaries and eleves all to reside at Paris.\n\nIn the year 1716, the duke of Orleans, then regent, made an alteration in their constitution, augmenting the number of honoraries and associates to twelve, admitting regulars among such associates, suppressing the class of eleves, and establishing in lieu thereof a new class of twelve adjuncts to the five several kinds of science cultivated by the academy; and, lastly, appointing a vice-president, to be chosen yearly by the king out of the honorary members, and a director and sub-director out of the pensionaries.\n\nThe academies of Florence and Bologna, of Montpelier and Bordeaux, of Leipic and Berlin, and of late those of Petersburg and Seville, were formed upon the same model with the Royal Academy of Sciences.\n\nFrench Academy, a society of forty, established for improving the French language.\n\nThis academy was founded by Cardinal Richlieu, and confirmed by the edict of Lewis XIII, in 1635. They have compiled a dictionary, intitled, Le Dictionnaire de l'academie Francoise. This work was begun in 1637, and finished in 1694. They have a director and chancellor, who are drawn by lot every three months, and a secretary who is perpetual. They meet at the old Louvre, on the Mondays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, all the year round, and hold an extraordinary meeting at the reception of a new member, and on St Lewis's day, when the prizes of eloquence and poetry are adjudged.\n\nRoyal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. This society was founded about the year 1648. The members were at first about twenty-five in number, viz. twelve officers, called ancients, eleven private members, and two syndics; but at present it consists of forty painters and sculptors. There are four perpetual rectors, nominated by the king; a director and chancellor; a secretary, who keeps the register, and counter-signs the dispatches; a treasurer, twelve professors, adjuncts to the rectors and professors, fix counsellors, a professor for the part of anatomy that belongs to painting and sculpture, and another for geometry and perspective.\n\nThere is also an academy of painting, sculpture, &c., at Rome, established by Lewis XIV, wherein those who have won the annual prize at Paris, are entitled to be three years entertained for their further improvement.\n\nAcademy of Medals and Inscriptions, called also The academy of belles lettres, was erected by Lewis XIV, for the study and explanation of ancient monuments, and to perpetuate the remembrance of great events, by medals, reliquos, inscriptions, &c. The plan of this academy was formed by Mr Colbert, and established in 1662. In its first institution it consisted only of four or five members; but in 1701, they were increased to forty, viz. ten honoraries, ten pensionaries, ten associates, and ten novices or eleves, under the direction of a president and vice-president, who are annually appointed by the king.\n\nTheir chief employment has been upon the medallic history of the reign of Lewis their founder. But the learned are indebted to this academy for many volumes of essays on other parts of history, published under the title of Memoirs, &c.\n\nAcademy of Architecture, established about the end of the year 1671 by Mr Colbert, consisted at first only of fix architects; but their number is since considerably increased.\n\nAcademy of Politics, is composed of fix persons, who meet at the Louvre, in the chamber where the papers relating to foreign affairs are lodged. But as the kings of France are unwilling to trust any, except their ministers, with the inspection of foreign affairs, this academy is of little use to the public.\n\nRoyal Academy of Dancing was established by the King of France in 1661. It consists of thirteen able dancing-masters,\nmasters, who meet once a-month; and two of the academists teach by turns the art of dancing, ancient and modern.\n\nThe French have also academies in most of their great cities, as, the Academy of Sciences at Montpelier, that of the Lanternnits at Thoulouse; besides others at N\u00eemes, Arles, Angiers, Lyons, Caen in Normandy, &c.; and the Chirurgical Academy at Paris is a modern institution for the general improvement of the art, and to compile and publish the ancient and modern history of it.\n\nRoyal Spanish Academy at Madrid, has for its object the cultivation of the Castilian tongue, and was established in 1714 by the Duke d'\u00c9falcona, with the approbation of the King of Spain. It consists of twenty-four academists, including the director and secretary.\n\nIn Portugal, John V. founded an historical academy at Lisbon, in the year 1720, for collecting and ascertaining the history of his own dominions. It consists of fifty members, a director, four censors, and a secretary.\n\nIn Germany, they have the Academy of Nature Curiosi, otherwise called the Leopoldine Academy, founded in 1652 by Jo. Laur. Bausch a physician, and, in 1670, taken under the protection of the Emperor Leopold. The design of this society was to promote medical knowledge. They began in 1684 to publish their observations, under the title of Epitome-rider; which publication has been continued annually, with some interruptions, and under different titles. This academy consists of a president, two adjuncts or secretaries, and colleagues or members without limitation.\n\nBerlin Academy, was founded by Frederick I. the late King of Prussia, in the year 1700. It has for its objects the improvement of natural knowledge, and the belles lettres. The charter of this society was amended in 1710, and by it the president is to be nominated by the king. The members are divided into four classes; 1. for physic, medicine, and chemistry; 2. for mathematics, astronomy, and mechanics; 3. for the German language, and the history of the country; 4. for Oriental learning, particularly what relates to the propagation of the gospel among infidels. The great promoter of this foundation was the celebrated Mr Leibnitz.\n\nRussian Academy was founded by Czar Peter the Great, at Petersburg, upon the plan of the Academy of Sciences at Paris; besides which, they take in the Russian language.\n\nAcademy is also a term for schools and other seminaries of learning among the Jews, where their rabbins and doctors instructed their youth in the Hebrew language, and explained to them the Talmud, and the secrets of the Cabbala; Thofoe of Tiberias and Babylon have been the most noted.\n\nAcademy is often used with us to denote a kind of collegiate school, where youth are instructed in arts and sciences. There is one at Portsmouth for teaching navigation, drawing, &c.; another at Woolwich, for fortification, gunnery, &c.\n\nAcademy is likewise a name given to a riding-school, where young gentlemen are taught to ride the great horse, &c., and the ground allotted for it is usually called the Menage.\n\nAcademy figure, a drawing of a naked man or woman, taken from the life, which is usually done on paper with red or black chalk, and sometimes with pastils or crayons.\n\nAcadie, or Acadia, in geography, a name formerly given to Nova Scotia, one of our American colonies.

It has been much disputed whether the inhabitants of Arabia, Ethiopia, &c., ever eat locusts. We shall give the substance of what Hasselquist says on this subject, who travelled in Syria and Egypt so late as the year 1752. This ingenious gentleman, who travelled with a view to improve natural history, informs us, that he asked Franks, and many other people who had lived long in these countries, whether they had ever heard that the inhabitants of Arabia and Ethiopia, &c., used locusts as food. They answered that they had. He likewise asked the same question of Armenians, Cophites, and Syrians, who lived in Arabia, and had travelled in Syria and near the Red-sea; some of whom said they heard of such a practice, and others that they had often seen the people eat these insects. He at last obtained complete satisfaction on this head from a learned sheik at Cairo, who had lived six years in Mecca. This gentleman told him, in presence of M. le Grand, the principal French interpreter at Cairo, and others, that a famine frequently rages at Mecca when there is a scarcity of corn in Egypt, which obliges the inhabitants to live upon coarser food than ordinary: That when corn is scarce, the Arabians grind the locusts in hand-mills, or stone mortars, and bake them into cakes, and use these cakes in place of bread: That he has frequently seen locusts used by the Arabians, even when there was no scarcity of corn; but then they boil them, stew them with butter, and make them into a kind of fricasse, which he says is not disagreeably tasted; for he had sometimes tasted these locust-fricasses out of curiosity. From this account, we may see the folly of that dispute among divines about the nature of St John's food in the wilderness. Some of them say that locusts were the fruits of certain trees, others that they were a kind of birds, &c.; but those who adhered to the literal meaning of the text were at least the most orthodox, although their arguments were perhaps not so strong as they might have been, had they had an opportunity of quoting such an author as Hasselquist.","sp":36,"ep":36},{"h":"ACRIMONY","t":"that quality in bodies which renders them acrid to the taste.","sp":37,"ep":37},{"h":"ACRITHYMIA","t":"in surgery, a large tumour resembling a wart, though sometimes flat and depressed.

The office of King's advocate is not very ancient: It seems to have been established about the beginning of the 16th century.

Immediately before putting on the gown, the candidate makes a short Latin speech to the lords, and then takes the oaths to the government and de fidei.\n\nThe faculty at present consists of above 200 members. As an advocate or lawyer is esteemed the gentlest profession in Scotland, many gentlemen of fortune take the degree of advocate, without having any intention of practising at the bar.

Anaxagoras maintained that \u00e6ther was of a similar nature with fire; Perrault represents it as 7200 times more rare than air; and Hook makes it more dense than gold itself. Whoever has an inclination to know the various hypotheses concerning \u00e6ther, may consult Shebbeare, Perrault, Hook's posthumous works, AA. Erud. Lips. 1716, Bernouilli's Cogitat. de graviatis aetheris, &c., &c.\n\nBefore the method of philosophising by induction was known, the hypotheses of philosophers were wild, fanciful, ridiculous. They had recourse to \u00e6ther, occult qualities, and other imaginary causes, in order to explain the various phenomena of nature; but since the days of the great Lord Verulam, who may be styled the parent of genuine philosophy, a contrary course has happily been followed. He convinced the world, that all knowledge must be derived from experiment and observation; and that every attempt to investigate causes by any other means must be unsuccessful. Since his time, the best philosophers have followed the tract which he pointed out. Boyle, Locke, Newton, Hales, and a few others, in little more than one century, have improved and extended science far beyond what the accumulated force of all the philosophers since the creation had been able to effectuate: a striking proof both of the comprehensive genius of Bacon, and of the solidity of his plan of investigation.\n\nIt must indeed be acknowledged, that there is a propensity in the human mind, which, unless it be properly restrained, has a direct tendency both to corrupt science, and to retard our progress in it. Not contented with the examination of objects which readily fall within the sphere of our observation, we feel a strong desire to account for things which, from their very nature, must, and ever will, elude our researches. Even Sir Isaac Newton himself was not proof against this temptation. It was not enough that he had discovered the nature of light and colours, the application of gravity to the motions of the heavenly bodies, &c.; he must go further, and attempt to assign the cause of gravity itself. But, how does he proceed in this matter? Not in the\nthe way of experiment, which had led him to his former discoveries, but in the way of conjecture, which will never lead any man to truth. He had recourse to a subtle elastic \u00e6ther, not much different from that of the ancients, and by it accounted for every thing he did not know, such as the cause of gravitation, muscular motion, sensation, &c.\n\nNorwithstanding the reputation of Sir Isaac, philosophers have generally looked upon this attempt as the foible of a great man, or, at least, as the most useless part of his works; and accordingly peruse it rather as a dream or a romance, than as having any connection with science. But we are sorry to find, that some late attempts have been made to revive this doctrine of \u00e6ther, particularly in a dissertation De ortu animalium caloris, published in May last.\n\nAs the revival of an old doctrine becomes in some measure a new one, we shall plead no other apology for inferring a specimen of the method of reasoning employed in this dissertation.\n\nThe author makes frequent use of a species of argument termed dilemma by logicians. For example, in the first part of the work, after endeavouring to prove that animal heat cannot be owing to fermentation, the motion of the fluids, and other causes that have usually been assigned, he draws this conclusion:\n\n\"If none of these causes are sufficient to produce the effect; therefore, by dilemma,\" says he, \"it must be sought for in the nature and action of the nerves.\"\n\nThis is a new species of dilemma: \u2014 If the author had proved, that the cause of heat in animals could not possibly exist anywhere, but either in fermentation, the motion of the fluids, &c. or in the nerves, after having disproved its existence in all the rest, his conclusion in favour of the nerves would have been just; but, as he has not so much as attempted this, the conclusion is not only false, but ridiculous.\n\nHowever, upon the authority of this dilemma, the author first gives what he calls a Compend of a new doctrine concerning the nerves, and then proceeds to inquire in what manner the nerves produce animal heat: He tells us, \"That thought (cogitatio) and sensation depend upon impulses either on the extremities of the nerves, or the sensorium commune, and the consequent motions produced by these impulses: That these motions are so quick, as to be almost instantaneous: That as all motion is mechanical; therefore thought, sensation, and muscular motion, must likewise be mechanical: That such quick motions cannot be produced without the intervention of some extreme ly elastic power; and, as Sir Isaac Newton has shown, that the impulses which occasion the different sensations must be owing to an elastic power; therefore the muscular motions of animals must be occasioned by the oscillations of some elastic power.\"\n\n\"But,\" says he, \"as this elastic power cannot exist in the solid nervous fibres, nor in any inelastic fluid; therefore, by dilemma, it must exist in an elastic fluid; and hence also, by the former dilemma, this elastic fluid must be seated, either in the nerves, or in their medullary substance.\"\n\nHere again the author calls Sir Isaac into his assistance.\u2014\"What confirms this opinion,\" says he, \"is the Newtonian \u00e6ther, which pervades all nature, and which, with a few variations in its modification, Sir Isaac has shown to be the cause of cohesion, elasticity, gravity, electricity, magnetism, &c. in the following manner: 1. As the rays of light, when reflected, do not touch the solid parts of bodies, but are reflected a little before they reach them, it is plain that the \u00e6ther not only fills the pores of bodies, but likewise floats upon their surfaces; and hence it becomes the cause of attraction and repulsion.\u20142. All metals, and inelastic fluids, are non-electrics; on the other hand, all solid bodies, metals excepted, are electrics, i.e. proper for accumulating \u00e6ther. But \u00e6ther, thus accumulated in such a variety of bodies, may produce various motions in the parts of these bodies, without inducing any change in the bodies themselves. Hence \u00e6ther, with some variations in its modification, is sufficient to account for all the phenomena of electricity. 3. As iron, by accumulating \u00e6ther around it, exhibits all the wonders of magnetism; so this magnetic \u00e6ther is more analogous to the nervous \u00e6ther of animals than any other kind of it. For, as the magnetic \u00e6ther passes along iron without changing any part of the iron; so the nervous \u00e6ther, in like manner, passes along the medullary substance of the nerves, and excites motion in any part that is continuous with them, without inducing any change in the nerves.\u20144. The irritability and life of plants, which very much resemble those in animals, cannot be explained by any inelastic cause, and must therefore be attributed to an \u00e6therial one.\n\nLastly, As the common \u00e6ther is differently modified in each of the substances above taken notice of, and also produces various motions or effects peculiar to each, it likewise varies and has some peculiar qualities when residing in animal bodies; so that the nervous or animal \u00e6ther is not exactly the same, but differs in some respects from those species of \u00e6ther which give rise to cohesion, gravity, magnetism, electricity,\" &c.\n\nHaving thus explained the nature and qualities of \u00e6ther, our author starts a very important question, viz: \"Whence is \u00e6ther derived? and whether does it leave any body after having once got possession of it?\"\n\nIn answer to this, he observes, \"That certain bodies have the power of collecting the electrical matter from every circumjacent body, and of accumulating it in their pores and on their surfaces, but do not suffer it again to transmigrate into any other body. There are other substances of an opposite nature, which do not accumulate the electric matter, but instantly allow it to pass into others, unless prohibited by an electric. Hence,\" says he, \"nothing more is necessary for substances of the former kind, but to be in such circumstances as allow them to accumulate the electric matter. In the same manner,\" proceeds our author, \"the nervous \u00e6ther, which is diffused through every part of nature, flows...\"\nflows copiously into the medullary part of the nerves,\nwhen no obstacle stands in its way; but, when once\nit has got there, it keeps firm possession, and never\nafterwards leaves it. Now,\" says he, \"a quan-\ntity of ether probably constitutes one of the fami-\nly parts of animal bodies, and increases in propor-\ntion to their age and growth: For nothing is more\nridiculous than to suppose that what is commonly\ncalled the nervous fluid can be daily wasted by la-\nbour and exercise, and daily repaired by a new se-\ncretion from the brain. To refute this vulgar no-\ntion, nothing more is necessary than to say, That\nit is one of Boerhaave's theories, and must be false,\nas all Boerhaave's other theories have been proved\nto be ill-founded! But ether is of a more fixed\nand determinate nature; whenever it gets possession\nof any substance, it never forsakes it, unless the\ntexture and constitution of the body itself be chan-\nged. Hence,\" continues our author, \"the ether\nof an acid body remains as long as the body conti-\nnues to be acid; the same observation holds with\nregard to the ether of an alkaline body: But, if\nthese two be blended together into a neutral salt,\nthe ether must likewise be changed into a neutral;\nand therefore, in the formation of the medullary\nor staminal part of animals, the ether which before\nbelonged to, or had the properties of some other sub-\nstance, is instantaneously changed into animal ether,\nand remains so till the dissolution of that animal.\"\n\nOur author next observes, \"That bodies require to\nbe in a certain state or condition in order to the for-\nmation of an ether that is proper for them. This\ncondition of bodies is called an excited state: Thus,\nas sulphur, when fluid, does not receive the electric\nmatter, but, when solid, instantly receives it; in\nthe same manner, the nerves, though properly\nformed, do not admit an ether adapted to their\nnature, unless they be in an excited state. Hence,\"\nsays he, \"the ether of a dead, and that of a living\nperson, are very different, although the texture and\nfigure of the nerves be the same. The state neces-\nsary for constituting the ether of a living animal,\nseems to depend on heat and moisture; because these\nthings are absolutely necessary in the constitution of\nlife: And hence,\" concludes our author, \"the ex-\ncited state of the nerves depends on heat and mois-\nture. There are also certain circumstances,\" says\nhe, \"which contribute to render the state of the\nnerves more or less apt for accumulating ether: A\nspasmodic fever, for example, renders the nerves of\nthe whole body less pervious to the motion of the\nether; and hence, in cases of this nature, health,\nand all the vital functions, must be injured.\"\n\n\"Therefore,\" our author observes, \"are the outlines\nof a new doctrine concerning the nature and func-\ntions of the nerves;\" and, upon this foundation,\nproceeds to give his new theory of animal heat.\n\n\"From the foregoing reasoning,\" says he, \"the\nheat, as well as all the functions of animals, seem\nto be occasioned by the oscillations of the nervous\nether betwixt the extremities of the sentient nerves\nand the brain, or, more properly, betwixt the brain\nand muscles. But electrical ether, as above ob-\nserved, varies a little from common ether; all in-\nelastic fluids, as was likewise formerly remarked,\nare non-electrics; and all solid bodies, metals ex-\ncepted, are electrics: These circumstances,\" says\nour author, \"seem to be owing to the oscillations of\nthe electric matter in bodies. In the same manner,\"\nsays he, \"the nature of animals may be such, and the\nnerves may be so constituted, as to form an ether ad-\napted to their nature, and to excite those oscillations\nwhich occasion animal heat. The wonderful effects\nof heat and cold upon the nerves,\" continues our\nauthor, \"confirms this theory: Every action, and\neven life itself, requires a certain degree of heat;\nfor, as the heat of the external air is so variable, it\nwas absolutely necessary that animal bodies should\nbe endowed with the faculty of producing a degree\nof heat suited to their nature, independent of ex-\nternal circumstances: Hence we see the reason why\nthe degree of heat so seldom varies in the same spe-\ncies of animals. However, although the nervous\nether is always ready for exciting heat by its oscil-\nlations; yet, in order to bring about this effect suc-\ncessfully, external stimuli are necessary, otherwise\nthe ether would be in danger of stagnating, which\nwould occasion sleep, apathy, and, last of all, death.\n\nThe most permanent of these stimuli is the pulsa-\ntion of the arteries; which is the reason why heat\nis so connected with the circulation of the blood,\nand why many authors have mistaken it for the true\ncause of animal heat.\"\n\nOur author now concludes with observing, \"That\nby his theory, the varieties of heat in different parts\nof the body, the heat and flushing of the face from\nshame, and all the other phenomena of heat in ani-\nmal bodies, admit of a better explanation, than by\nany other theory hitherto invented.\"\n\nHaving thus given a pretty full account of an at-\ntempt to explain the most abstruse operations of na-\nture, as nearly as possible in the very words of the\nauthor, we cannot deny ourselves the liberty of mak-\ning a few observations.\n\nTo give a formal refutation of this author's reason-\ning, is no part of our plan. It is, perhaps, wrong\nto say that he has reasoned; for the whole hypothet-\nical part of his essay is a mere farrago of vague affir-\nmations, non-entities, illogical conclusions, and extra-\nvagant fancies. His ether seems to be an exceedingly\ntractable sort of substance: Whenever the qualities of\none body differ from those of another, a different mo-\ndification of ether at once solves the phenomenon.\nThe ether of iron must not, to be sure, be exactly\nthe same with the nervous ether, otherwise it would\nbe in danger of producing sensation in place of mag-\nnetism. It would likewise have been very improper\nto give the vegetable ether exactly the same quali-\nties with those of animal ether; for, in such a case,\nmen would run great risk of striking root in the soil,\nand trees and hedges might eradicate and run about\nthe fields. Nothing can be more ludicrous than to see\na writer treating a mere ens rationis as familiarly as if it were an object of our senses: The notion of compounding the ether of an acid and that of an alkali, in order to make a neutral of it, is completely ridiculous. But if men take the liberty of substituting names in place of facts and experiments, it is an easy matter to account for any thing.\n\nBy this method of philosophising, obscurity is forever banished from the works of nature. It is impossible to gravel an \u00e6therial philosopher. Ask him what questions you please, his answer is ready:\u2014\u201cAs we cannot find the cause anywhere else; ergo, by dilemma, it must be owing to \u00e6ther!\u201d For example, ask one of those sages, What is the cause of gravity? he will answer, \u201cTis \u00e6ther! Ask him the cause of thought, he will gravely reply, \u201cThe solution of this question was once universally allowed to exceed the limits of human genius: But now, by the grand discoveries we have lately made, it is as plain as that three and two make five:\u2014Thought is a mere mechanical thing, an evident effect of certain motions in the brain produced by the oscillations of a subtle elastic fluid called \u00e6ther!\u201d This is indeed astonishing!\n\nSuch jargon, however, affords an excellent lesson to the true philosopher. It shows to what folly and extravagance mankind are led, whenever they deviate from experiment and observation in their inquiries into nature. No sooner do we leave these only faithful guides to science, than we instantly land in a labyrinth of nonsense and obscurity, the natural punishment of folly and presumption.\n\nWhen endeavouring to account for that propensity in the human mind which prompts us to attempt the solution of things evidently beyond our reach, we recollected a passage in Swift\u2019s works, which explains it in the most satisfactory manner.\n\n\u201cLet us next examine (says the Dean) the great introducers of new schemes in philosophy, and search till we can find from what faculty of the soul the disposition arises in mortal man, of taking it into his head to advance new systems, with such an eager zeal, in things agreed on all hands impossible to be known; from what seeds this disposition springs, and to what quality of human nature these grand innovators have been indebted for their number of disciples; because it is plain, that several of the chief among them, both ancient and modern, were usually mistaken by their adversaries, and indeed by all except their own followers, to have been persons crazed, or out of their wits; having generally proceeded, in the common course of their words and actions, by a method very different from the vulgar dictates of unrefined reason; agreeing, for the most part, in their several models, with their present undoubted successors in the Academy of modern Bedlam. Of this kind were Epicurus, Diogenes, Apollonius, Lucretius, Paracelsus, Des Cartes, and others; who, if they were now in the world, tied fast, and separated from their followers, would, in this undistinguishing age, incur manifest danger of phlebotomy, and whips, and chains, and dark chambers, and straw. For what man, in the natural state or course of thinking, did ever conceive it in his power to reduce the notions of all mankind exactly to the same length, and breadth, and height of his own? Yet this is the first humble and civil design of all innovators in the empire of reason.\u2014Now, I would gladly be informed, how it is possible to account for such imaginations as these in particular men, without recourse to my phenomenon of vapours, (i.e. \u00e6ther), ascending from the lower faculties to overshadow the brain, and there distilling into conceptions, for which the narrowness of our mother-tongue has not yet assigned any other name besides that of madness or frenzy. Let us therefore now conjecture how it comes to pass that none of these great projectors do ever fail providing themselves and their notions with a number of implicit disciples; and I think the reason is easy to be assigned.\u2014For there is a peculiar string in the harmony of human understanding, which, in several individuals, is exactly of the same tuning. This if you can dextrously screw up to its right key, and then strike gently upon it, whenever you have the good fortune to light among those of the same pitch, they will, by a secret necessary sympathy, strike exactly at the same time. And in this one circumstance lies all the skill or lack of the matter: For if you chance to jar the string, among those who are either above or below your own height, instead of subscribing to your doctrine, they will tie you fast, call you mad, and feed you with bread and water. It is therefore a point of the nicest conduct, to cliffinguish and adapt this noble talent with respect to the difference of persons and of times.\u2014For, to speak a bold truth, it is a fatal miscarriage to ill to order affairs as to pass for a fool in one company, when in another you might be treated as a philosopher: Which I desire some certain gentlemen of my acquaintance to lay up in their hearts as a very seasonable innuendo.\u201d\n\nWe would not have dwelt so long upon this article, had it not been to guard, as far as our influence extends, the minds of those who may be unacquainted with the genuine principles of philosophy, from being led into a wrong track of investigation.\n\n\u00c6ther, in chymistry, a name given to any volatile spirit.

It is also joined to Asia by a narrow neck of land betwixt the Mediterranean and Red-sea, called the isthmus of Suez: Hence Africa is a peninsula somewhat resembling a pyramid, whose base from Tangier to the isthmus of Suez is about 2000 miles; its perpendicular, from the vertex at the cape of Good Hope to Buria, 3600 miles; and from cape Verd, to cape Guard a Frii, it is 3500. The situation of this quarter on the globe is betwixt 35\u00b0 S. and 36\u00b0 N. lat. and betwixt 17\u00b0 35' W. and 53\u00b0 21' E. long. Hence it lies, for the most part, within the tropics; by which means, in many places, the heat is almost insupportable. Along the coasts, it is in general reckoned abundantly fruitful, and its produce excellent. The Romans very justly considered Africa as the patria farrum, for there is no other place breeds the number or the variety. In this quarter there are several deserts, some of them of vast extent, covered with sand, by which whole caravans have been sometimes smothered. The principal rivers are the Nile and the Niger, the first of which disemboques itself into the Mediterranean, after traversing Abyssinia, Nubia, and Egypt; and the last into the Atlantic ocean, by a western course from Upper Ethiopia. Geographers are not yet agreed about the sources of either of these rivers; according to some, their sources are not far distant from each other. There are some mountains in Africa remarkably high, particularly in Abyssinia and Barbary, in which last is the famous mount Atlas, which separates Barbary from Biledulgerid. The prevailing religions here, are Mahometanism and Paganism: Christianity only takes place among the Abyssinians and European settlements. The government in Africa is in general despotic, and the inhabitants black. In the division, geographers have gone variously to work; we shall confine ourselves to the more general, viz.

A compendious view, therefore, of every material discovery that hath hitherto been made in this art, must be useful both to the farmer and philosopher.\n\nTo accomplish this end with the greater perspicuity, the subject shall be divided into two parts. Under the first, Vegetation, and the Structure of Plants, shall be considered. The second will contain the various Operations upon the Soil, in order to prepare it for the reception and nourishment of plants.\n\nFor the ease of the reader, each of these parts shall be subdivided into a number of sections.\n\nPART I.\n\nOf Vegetation, and the Structure of Plants.\n\nTHE vegetation and economy of plants is one of those subjects in which our knowledge is extremely circumscribed. Many hypotheses have been invented; as many have been, or may easily be, refuted. Hypotheses in matters that evidently exceed our powers do much hurt: But they are likewise of some use. They incite to further inquiries; and these inquiries are carried on with greater spirit, because they are intended for the purpose of confuting. It is true this spirit is not the most friendly to impartial observation; but it makes us more indefatigable in our researches.\n\nRetailing theories is no part of our plan. A total inattention to the structure and economy of plants is the chief reason of the small progress that has been made in the principles of vegetation, and of the instability and fluctuation of our theories concerning it.\n\nTo recall the attention of philosophers and cultivators, to the only source from which any solid theory can ever be formed on this subject, we shall give a short description of the structure of plants, beginning with the seed, and tracing its progress and evolution to a state of maturity.\n\nSECT. I. Of Seeds.\n\nThe seeds of plants are of various figures and sizes. Most of them are divided into two lobes; though some, as those of the cress-kind, have six; and others, as the grains of corn, are not divided, but entire.\n\nBut, as the essential properties of all seeds are the same, when considered with regard to the principles of vegetation, our particular descriptions shall be limited to one seed, viz. the great garden-bean. Neither is the choice of this seed altogether arbitrary; for, after it begins to vegetate, its parts are more conspicuous than many others, and consequently better calculated for investigation.\n\nThis seed is covered with two coats or membranes.\nThe outer coat is extremely thin, and full of pores; but may be easily separated from the inner one, (which is much thicker), after the bean has been boiled, or lain a few days in the soil. At the thick end of the bean, there is a small hole visible to the naked eye, immediately over the radicle or future root, that it may have a free passage into the soil. Plate IV. fig. 1. A. When these coats are taken off, the body of the seed appears, which is divided into two smooth portions or lobes. The smoothness of the lobes is owing to a thin film or cuticle with which they are covered.\n\nAt the basis of the bean is placed the radicle or future root, Plate IV. fig. 3. A. The trunk of the radicle, just as it enters into the body of the seed, divides into two capital branches, one of which is inserted into each lobe, and sends off smaller ones in all directions through the whole substance of the lobes, Plate IV. fig. 7. A. These ramifications become so extremely minute towards the edges of the lobes, that they require the finest glasses to render them visible. To these ramifications Grew and Malpighius have given the name of seminal root; because, by means of it, the radicle and plume, before they are expanded, derive their principal nourishment.\n\nThe plume, bud, or germ, Plate IV. fig. 3, is inclosed in two small corresponding cavities in each lobe. Its colour and consistence is much the same with those of the radicle, of which it is only a continuation; but having a quite contrary direction: For the radicle descends into the earth, and divides into a great number of smaller branches or filaments; but the plume ascends into the open air, and unfolds itself into all the beautiful variety of stem, branches, leaves, flowers, fruit, &c. The plume in corn shoots from the smaller end of the grain, and, among maltsters, goes by the name of acrospire.\n\nThe next thing to be taken notice of is the sublance, or parenchymatous part of the lobes. This is not a mere concreted juice, but is curiously organized, and consists of a vast number of small bladders resembling those in the pith of trees, Plate IV. fig. 4.\n\nBesides the coats, cuticle, and parenchymatous parts, there is a substance perfectly distinct from these, distributed in different proportions through the radicle, plume, and lobes. This inner substance appears very plainly in a transverse section of the radicle or plume. Towards the extremity of the radicle, it is one entire trunk; but higher up, it divides into three branches; the middle one runs directly up to the plume, and the other two pass into the lobes on each side, and spread out into a great variety of small branches through the whole body of the lobes, Plate IV. fig. 7. This substance is very properly termed the seminal root: for when the seed is sown, the moisture is first absorbed by the outer coats, which are everywhere furnished with sap and air-vessels; from these it is conveyed to the cuticle; from the cuticle it proceeds to the pulpy part of the lobes; when it has got thus far, it is taken up by the mouths of the small branches of the seminal root, and passes from one branch into another, till it is all collected into the main trunk, which communicates both with the plume and radicle, the two principal involved organs of the future plant. After this the sap, or vegetable food, runs in two opposite directions; part of it ascends into the plume, and promotes the growth and expansion of that organ; and part of it descends into the radicle, for nourishing and evolving the root and its various filaments. Thus the plume and radicle continue their progress in opposite directions, till the plant arrives at maturity.\n\nIt is here worth remarking, that every plant is really possessed of two roots, both of which are contained in the seed. The plume and radicle, when the seed is first deposited in the earth, derive their nourishment from the seminal root: but, afterwards, when the radicle begins to shoot out its filaments, and to absorb some moisture, not, however, in a sufficient quantity to supply the exigencies of the plume, the two lobes, or main body of the seed, rise along with the plume, assume the appearance of two leaves, resembling the lobes of the seed in size and shape, but having no resemblance to those of the plume, for which reason they have got the name of dissimilar leaves.\n\nThese dissimilar leaves defend the young plume from the injuries of the weather, and at the same time, by absorbing dew, air, &c., assist the tender radicle in nourishing the plume, with which they have still a connection by means of the seminal root above described. But, when the radicle or second root has descended deep enough into the earth, and has acquired a sufficient number of filaments or branches for absorbing as much aliment as is proper for the growth of the plume; then the seminal, or dissimilar leaves, their utility being entirely superseded, begin to decay and fall off.\n\nPlate IV.

The appearance of the radicle, plume, and seminal root, when a little further advanced in growth.\n\nHaving thus briefly described the seed, and traced its evolution into three principal organic parts, viz., the plume, radicle, and seminal leaves, we shall next take an anatomical view of the root, trunk, leaves, &c.\nSect. II. Of the Root.\n\nIn examining the root of plants, the first thing that presents itself is the skin, which is of various colours in different plants. Every root, after it has arrived at a certain age, has a double skin. The first is coeval with the other parts, and exists in the seed; but afterwards there is a ring sent off from the bark, and forms a second skin; e.g., in the root of the dandelion, towards the end of May, the original or outer skin appears shriveled, and is easily separated from the new one, which is fresher, and adheres more firmly to the bark. Perennial plants are supplied in this manner with a new skin every year; the outer one always falls off in the autumn or winter, and a new one is formed from the bark in the succeeding spring. The skin has numerous cells or vessels, and is a continuation of the parenchymatous part of the radicle. However, it does not consist solely of parenchyma; for the microscope shows that there are many tubular lignous vessels interposed through it.\n\nWhen the skin is removed, the true cortical substance or bark appears, which is also a continuation of the parenchymatous part of the radicle, but greatly augmented. The bark is of very different sizes. In most trees, it is exceeding thin in proportion to the wood and pith. On the other hand, in carrots, it is almost one half of the semi diameter of the root; and, in dandelion, it is nearly twice as thick as the woody part.\n\n1. The Bark is composed of two substances; the parenchyma, or pulp, which is the principal part; and a few woody fibres. The parenchyma is exceedingly porous, and has a great resemblance to a sponge; for it shrivels considerably when dried, and dilates to its former dimensions when infused in water. These pores or vessels are not pervious so as to communicate with each other, but consist of distinct little cells or bladders, scarcely visible without the assistance of the microscope. In all roots, these cells are constantly filled with a thin watery liquor. They are generally of a spherical figure; though in some roots, as the buglofs and dandelion, they are oblong. In many roots, as the horseradish, peony, asparagus, potatoe, &c., the parenchyma is of one uniform structure. But in others it is more diversified, and puts on the shape of rays running from the centre towards the circumference of the bark. These rays sometimes run quite through the bark, as in lovage; and sometimes advance towards the middle of it, as in melilot and most of the leguminous and umbelliferous plants. These rays generally stand at an equal distance from each other in the same plant; but the distance varies greatly in different plants. Neither are they of equal sizes: In carrot they are exceedingly small, and scarcely discernible; in melilot and chervil, they are thicker. They are likewise more numerous in some plants than in others. Sometimes they are of the same thickness from one edge of the bark to the other; and some grow wider as they approach towards the skin. The vessels with which these rays are amply furnished, are supposed to be air-vessels, because they are always found to be dry, and not so transparent as the vessels which evidently contain the sap.\n\nIn all roots, there are lignous vessels dispersed in different proportions through the parenchyma of the bark. These lignous vessels run longitudinally through the bark in the form of small threads, which are tubular, as is evident from the rising of the sap in them when a root is cut transversely. These lignous sap-vessels do not run in direct lines through the bark, but, at small distances, incline towards one another in such a manner, that they appear to the naked eye to be inoculated; but the microscope discovers them to be only contiguous, and braided together by the parenchyma. These braids or co-connections are very various both in size and number in different roots; but in all plants they are most numerous towards the inner edge of the bark. Neither are these vessels single tubes, but, like the nerves in animals, are bundles of twenty or thirty small contiguous cylindrical tubes, which uniformly run from the extremity of the root, without sending off any branches, or suffering any change in their size or shape.\n\nIn some roots, as parsnip, especially in the ring next the inner extremity of the bark, these vessels contain a kind of lymph, which is sweeter than the sap contained in the bladders of the parenchyma. From this circumstance they have got the name of lymph-ducks.\n\nThese lymph-ducks sometimes yield a mucilaginous lymph, as in the comfrey; and sometimes a white milky glutinous lymph, as in the angelica, fennel, burdock, scorzonera, dandelion, &c. The lymph-ducks are supposed to be the vessels from which the gums and balsams are secreted. The lymph of fennel, when exposed to the air, turns into a clear transparent balsam; and that of the scorzonera, dandelion, &c., condenses into a gum.\n\nThe situation of the vessels is various. In some plants, they stand in a ring or circle at the inner edge of the bark, as in asparagus; in others, they appear in lines, or rays, as in horseradish; in the parsnip, and several other plants, they are most conspicuous toward the outer edge of the bark; and in the dandelion, they are disposed in the form of concentric circles.\n\n2. The Wood of roots is that part which appears after the bark is taken off, and is firmer and less porous than the bark or pith. It consists of two distinct substances, viz., the pulpy, or parenchymatous, and the lignous. The wood is connected to the bark by large portions of the bark inserted into it. These insertions are mostly in the form of rays, tending to the centre of the pith, which are easily discernible by the eye in a transverse section of most roots. These insertions, like the bark, consist of many vessels, mostly of a round or oval figure.\n\nThe lignous vessels are generally disposed in collateral rows running longitudinally through the root. Some of these contain air, and others sap. The air-vessels are so called, because they contain no liquor. These air-vessels are distinguished by being whiter than the others.\n\n3. The Pith is the centrical part of the root. Some roots have no pith, as the stramonium, nicotiana, &c.; others have little or none at the extremities of the roots, but have a considerable quantity of it near the top. The pith, like every other part of a plant, is derived from\nfrom the seed; but in some it is more immediately derived from the bark. For the insertions of the bark running in betwixt the rays of the wood, meet in the centre, and constitute the pith. It is owing to this circumstance, that among roots which have no pith in their lower parts, they are amply provided with it towards the top, as in cumbine, lovage, &c.\n\nThe bladders of the pith are of very different sizes, and generally of a circular figure. Their position is more uniform than in the bark. Their sides are not mere films, but a composition of small fibres or threads; which gives the pith, when viewed with a microscope, the appearance of a piece of fine gauze, or net-work.\n\nWe shall conclude the description of roots, with observing, that their whole substance is nothing but a congeries of tubes and fibres, adapted by nature for the absorption of nourishment, and of course the extension and augmentation of their parts.\n\nPlate IV.

B. This root has no pith.\n\nSect. III. Of the Trunk, Stalk, or Stem.\n\nIn describing the trunks of plants, it is necessary to premise, that whatever is said with regard to them, applies equally to the branches.\n\nThe trunk, like the root, consists of three parts, viz. the bark, wood, and pith. These parts, though substantially the same in the trunk as in the root, are in many cases very different in their texture and appearance.\n\n1. The skin of the bark is composed of very minute bladders, interspersed with longitudinal woody fibres, as in the nettle, thistle, and most herbs. The outside of the skin is visibly porous in some plants, particularly the cane.\n\nThe principal body of the bark is composed of pulp or parenchyma, and innumerable vessels much larger than those of the skin. The texture of the pulpy part, tho' the same substance with the parenchyma in roots, yet seldom appears in the form of rays running towards the pith; and when these rays do appear, they do not extend above half way to the circumference. The vessels of the bark are very differently situated, and destined for various purposes in different plants. For example, in the bark of the Pine, the innermost are lymph-ducts, and exceedingly small; the outmost are gum or resiniferous vessels, destined for the secretion of turpentine; and are so large, as to be distinctly visible to the naked eye.\n\n2. The Wood lies betwixt the bark and pith, and consists of two parts, viz. a parenchymatous, and lignous. In all trees, the parenchymatous part of the wood, though much diversified as to size and consistence, is uniformly disposed in diametrical rays, or insertions running betwixt similar rays of the lignous part.\n\nThe true wood is nothing but a congeries of old dried lymph-ducts. Between the bark and the wood a new ring of these ducts is formed every year, which gradually looses its softness as the cold season approaches, and, towards the middle of winter, is condensed into a solid ring of wood. These annual rings, which are distinctly visible in most trees when cut through, serve as natural marks to distinguish their age. Plate V. fig. 1, 2. The rings of one year are sometimes larger, sometimes less, than those of another, probably owing to the favourable or unfavourable effects of the season.\n\n3. The Pith, though of a different texture, is exactly of the same substance with the parenchyma of the bark, and the insertions of the wood. The quantity of pith is various in different plants. Instead of being increased every year like the wood, it is annually diminished, its vessels drying up, and assuming the appearance and structure of wood; in so much that in old trees there is scarce such a thing as pith to be discerned.\n\nA ring of sap-vesicles are usually placed at the outer edge of the pith, next the wood. In the pine, fig, and walnut, they are very large. The parenchyma of the pith, is composed of small cells or bladders, of the same kind with those of the bark, only of a larger size. The general figure of these bladders is circular; though in some plants, as the thistle, and borage, they are angular. Though the pith is originally one connected chain of bladders; yet as the plant grows old, they shrivel, and open in different directions. In the walnut, after a certain age, it appears in the form of a regular transverse hollow division. In some plants, it is altogether wanting; in others, as the fenchus, nettle, &c., there is only a transverse partition of it at every joint. Many other varieties might be mentioned; but these must be left to the observation of the reader.\n\nPlate V. Fig. 1. A transverse section of a branch of ash, as it appears to the eye.\n\nFig. 2.

IV. Of the Leaves.\n\nThe leaves of plants consist of the same substance with that of the trunk. They are full of nerves, or woody portions, running in all directions, and branching out into innumerable small threads, interwoven with the Parenchyma like fine lace or gauze.\n\nThe skin of the leaf, like that of an animal, is full of pores, which both serve for perspiration, and for the absorption of dews, air, &c. These pores, or orifices, differ both in shape and magnitude in different plants, which is the cause of that variety of texture or grain peculiar to every plant.\n\nThe pulpy or parenchymatous part, consists of very minute fibres, wound up into small cells or bladders. These cells are of various sizes in the same leaf.\n\nAll leaves, of whatever figure, have a marginal fibre, by which all the rest are bounded. The particular shape of this fibre determines the figure of the leaf.\n\nThe vessels of leaves have the appearance of inosculation; but, when examined by the microscope, they are found only to be interwoven, or laid along each other.\n\nWhat is called air-vessels, or those which carry no sap, are visible even to the naked eye in some leaves. When a leaf is slowly broke, they appear like small woolly fibres, connected to both ends of the broken piece.\n\nPlate VI. Fig. 1. The appearance of the air-vessels to the eye, in a vine leaf drawn gently afunder.\n\nFig. 2. A small piece cut off that leaf.\n\nFig. 3. The same piece magnified, in which the vessels have the appearance of a screw.\n\nFig. 4. The appearance of these vessels as they exist in the leaf before they are stretched out.\n\nSect. V. Of the Flower.\n\nIt is needless here to mention any thing of the texture, or of the vessels, &c. of flowers, as they are pretty similar to those of the leaf. It would also be foreign to our present purpose, to take any notice of the characters and distinctions of flowers. These belong to the science of Botany, to which the reader is referred.\n\nThere is one curious fact, however, which must not be omitted, viz. That every flower is perfectly formed in all its parts many months before it appears outwardly; that is, the flowers which appear this year, are not, properly speaking, the flowers of this year, but of the last. For example, mezereon generally flowers in January; but these flowers were completely formed in the month of August preceding. Of this fact any one may satisfy himself by separating the coats of a tulip root about the beginning of September; and he will find that the two innermost form a kind of cell, in the centre of which stands the young flower, which is not to make its appearance till the following April or May.\n\nPlate VI. Fig. 5. Exhibits a view of the tulip-root when dissected in September, with the young flower towards the bottom.\n\nSect. VI. Of the Fruit.\n\nIn describing the structure of fruits, a few examples shall be taken from such as are most generally known.\n\n1. A Pear, besides the skin, which is a production of the skin of the bark, consists of a double parenchyma or pulp, sap, and air-vessels, calculary, and acetary.\n\nThe outer parenchyma is the same substance continued from the bark, only its bladders are larger and more succulent.\n\nIt is everywhere interspersed with small globules or grains, and the bladders respect these grains as a kind of centres, every grain being the centre of a number of bladders. The sap and air-vessels in this pulp are extremely small.\n\nNext the core is the inner pulp or parenchyma, which consists of bladders of the same kind with the outer, only larger and more oblong, corresponding to those of the pulp, from which it seems to be derived. This inner pulp is much fouler than the other, and has none of the small grains interspersed through it; and hence it has got the name of acetary.\n\nBetween the acetary and outer pulp, the globules or grains begin to grow larger, and gradually unite into a hard stony body, especially towards the corculum, or stool of the fruit; and from this circumstance it has been called the calculary.\n\nThese grains are not derived from any of the organic parts of the tree, but seem rather to be a kind of concretions precipitated from the sap, similar to the precipitations from wine, urine, and other liquors.\n\nThe core is a roundish cavity in the centre of the pear, lined with a hard woody membrane, in which the seed is inclosed. At the bottom of the core there is a small duct or canal, which runs up to the top of the pear; this canal allows the air to get into the core, for the purpose of drying and ripening the seeds.\n\nPlate VII.

But if we would express that \\(a\\) is greater than \\(b\\), we write \\(a > b\\); and if we would express algebraically that \\(a\\) is less than \\(b\\), we write \\(a < b\\).\n\nQuantity is what is made up of parts, or is capable of being greater or less. It is increased by addition, and diminished by subtraction; which are therefore the two primary operations that relate to quantity. Hence it is, that any quantity may be supposed to enter into algebraic computations two different ways, which have contrary effects; either as an increment, or as a decrement; that is, as a quantity to be added, or as a quantity to be subtracted. The sign + (plus) is the mark of addition, and the sign \u2014 (minus) of subtraction. Thus the quantity being represented by \\(a\\), \\(+ a\\) imports that \\(a\\) is to be added, or represents an increment; but, \\(- a\\) imports that \\(a\\) is to be subtracted, and represents a decrement.\n\nWhen several such quantities are joined, the signs serve to show which are to be added and which are to be subtracted. Thus \\(+ a + b\\) denotes the quantity that arises when \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both considered as increments, and therefore expresses the sum of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But \\(+ a - b\\) denotes the quantity that arises, when from the quantity \\(a\\) the quantity \\(b\\) is subtracted; and expresses the excess of \\(a\\) above \\(b\\). When \\(a\\) is greater than \\(b\\), then \\(a - b\\) is itself an increment; when \\(a = b\\), then \\(a - b = 0\\); and when \\(a\\) is less than \\(b\\), then \\(a - b\\) is itself a decrement.\n\nAs addition and subtraction are opposite, or an increment is opposite to a decrement, there is an analogous opposition between the affections of quantities that are considered in the mathematical sciences; as, between excess and defect; between the value of effects or money due to a man, and money due by him. When two quantities, equal in respect of magnitude, but of those opposite kinds, are joined together, and conceived to take place in the same subject, they destroy each other's effect, and their amount is nothing. Thus, 100l. due to a man and 100l. due by him balance each other, and in estimating his stock may be both neglected. When two unequal quantities of those opposite qualities are joined in the same subject, the greater prevails by their difference. And, when a greater quantity is taken from a lesser of the same kind, the remainder becomes of the opposite kind.\n\nA quantity that is to be added is likewise called a positive quantity; and a quantity to be subtracted is said to be negative. They are equally real, but opposite to each other, so as to take away each other's effect, in any operation, when they are equal as to quantity. Thus, \\(3 - 3 = 0\\), and \\(a - a = 0\\). But though \\(+ a\\) and \\(- a\\) are equal as to quantity, we do not suppose in algebra that \\(+ a = - a\\); because, to infer equality in this science, they must not only be equal as to quantity, but of the same quality, that in every operation the one may have the same effect as the other. A decrement may be equal to an increment, but it has in all operations a contrary effect; a motion downwards may be equal to a motion upwards; and the depression of a star below the horizon may be equal to the elevation of a star above it: But these positions are opposite, and the distance of the stars is greater than if one of them was at the horizon, so as to have no elevation above it, or depression below it. It is on account of this contrariety, that a negative quantity is said to be less than nothing, because it is opposite to the positive, and diminishes it when joined to it; whereas the addition of 0 has no effect. But a negative is to be considered no less as a real quantity than the positive. Quantities that have no sign prefixed to them are understood to be positive.\n\nThe number prefixed to a letter is called the numeral coefficient, and shows how often the quantity represented by the letter is to be taken. Thus \\(2 a\\) imports that the quantity represented by \\(a\\) is to be taken twice; \\(3 a\\) that it is to be taken thrice; and so on. When no number is prefixed, unit is understood to be the coefficient. Thus 1 is the coefficient of \\(a\\) or of \\(b\\).\n\nQuantities are said to be like or similar, that are represented by the same letter or letters equally repeated. Thus \\(+ 3 a\\) and \\(- 5 a\\) are like; but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), or \\(a\\) and \\(a a\\) are unlike.\n\nA quantity is said to consist of as many terms as there are parts joined by the signs + or \u2014; thus \\(a + b\\) consists of two terms, and is called a binomial; \\(a + b + c\\) consists of three terms, and is called a trinomial. These are called compound quantities: A simple quantity consists of one term only, as \\(+ a\\), or \\(+ a b\\), or \\(+ a b c\\).\n\n**Chap. I. Of Addition.**\n\n**Case I. To add quantities that are like, and have like signs.**\n\n**Rule.** Add together the coefficients, to their sum prefix the common sign, and subjoin the common letter or letters.\n\n**Example.** To \\(+ 5 a\\) to \\(- 6 b\\) to \\(a + b\\)\n\nAdd \\(+ 4 a\\) add \\(- 2 b\\) add \\(3 a + 5 b\\)\n\nSum \\(+ 9 a\\) Sum \\(- 8 b\\) Sum \\(4 a + 6 b\\)\n\n**Case II. To add quantities that are like, but have unlike signs.**\n\n**Rule.** Subtract the lesser coefficient from the greater, prefix the sign of the greater to the remainder, and subjoin the common letter or letters.\n\n**Example.** To \\(- 4 a\\) \\(+ 5 b - 6 c\\)\n\nAdd \\(+ 7 a\\) \\(- 3 b + 8 c\\)\n\nSum \\(+ 3 a\\) \\(2 b + 2 c\\)\n\nThis rule is easily deduced from the nature of positive and negative quantities.\n\nIf there are more than two quantities to be added together, first add the positive together into one sum, and then the negative (by Case I.); then add these two sums together (by Case II.).\nCASE III. To add quantities that are unlike.\n\nRULE. Set them all down one after another, with their signs and coefficients prefixed.\n\nEXAMPLE. To \\(+2a\\)\n\nAdd \\(+3b\\)\n\nSum \\(2a + 3b\\)\n\n\\(3a - 4x\\)\n\nCHAP. II. Of Subtraction.\n\nGENERAL RULE. \"Change the signs of the quantity to be subtracted into their contrary signs, and then add it so changed to the quantity from which it was to be subtracted, (by the rules of the last chapter): the sum arising by this addition is the remainder.\" For, to subtract any quantity, either positive or negative, is the same as to add the opposite kind.\n\nEXAMPLE. From \\(+5a\\)\n\nSubtract \\(+3a\\)\n\nRemaind. \\(5a - 3a\\), or \\(2a\\)\n\n\\(8a - 7b\\)\n\n\\(3a + 4b\\)\n\n\\(5a - 11b\\)\n\nIt is evident, that to subtract or take away a decrement is the same as adding an equal increment. If we take away \\(-b\\) from \\(a - b\\), there remains \\(a\\); and if we add \\(+b\\) to \\(a - b\\), the sum is likewise \\(a\\). In general, the subtraction of a negative quantity is equivalent to adding its positive value.\n\nCHAP. III. Of Multiplication.\n\nIn Multiplication, the general rule for the signs is,\n\nThat when the signs of the factors are like, (i.e., both \\(+\\) or both \\(-\\)), the sign of the product is \\(+\\); but when the signs of the factors are unlike, the sign of the product is \\(-\\).\n\nCASE I. When any positive quantity, \\(+a\\), is multiplied by any positive number, \\(+n\\), the meaning is, That \\(+a\\) is to be taken as many times as there are units in \\(n\\); and the product is evidently \\(na\\).\n\nCASE II. When \\(-a\\) is multiplied by \\(n\\), then \\(-a\\) is to be taken as often as there are units in \\(n\\), and the product must be \\(-na\\).\n\nCASE III. Multiplication by a positive number implies a repeated addition: But multiplication by a negative implies a repeated subtraction. And when \\(+a\\) is to be multiplied by \\(-n\\), the meaning is, That \\(+a\\) is to be subtracted as often as there are units in \\(n\\): Therefore the product is negative, being \\(-na\\).\n\nCASE IV. When \\(-a\\) is to be multiplied by \\(-n\\), then \\(-a\\) is to be subtracted as often as there are units in \\(n\\); but (by chap. II,) to subtract \\(-a\\) is equivalent to adding \\(+a\\), consequently the product is \\(+na\\).\n\nThe IIth and IVth Cases may be illustrated in the following manner.\n\nBy the definitions, \\(+a - a = 0\\); therefore if we multiply \\(+a - a\\) by \\(n\\), the product must vanish, or be 0, because the factor \\(a - a\\) is 0. The first term of the product is \\(+na\\) (by Case I.) Therefore the second term of the product must be \\(-na\\), which destroys \\(+na\\); so that the whole product must be \\(+na - na = 0\\). Therefore \\(-a\\) multiplied by \\(+n\\) gives \\(-na\\).\n\nIn like manner, if we multiply \\(+a - a\\) by \\(-n\\), the first term of the product being \\(-na\\), the latter term of the product must be \\(+na\\); because the two together must destroy each other, or their amount be 0, since one of the factors (viz. \\(a - a\\)) is 0. Therefore \\(-a\\) multiplied by \\(-n\\), must give \\(+na\\).\n\nIn this general doctrine, the multiplicator is always considered as a number. A quantity of any kind may be multiplied by a number.\n\nIf the quantities to be multiplied are simple quantities, \"find the sign of the product by the last rule; after it place the product of the coefficients, and then let down all the letters after one another as in one word.\"\n\nEXAMPLE. Mult. \\(+a\\)\n\nBy \\(+b\\)\n\nProd. \\(+ab\\)\n\nMult. \\(-8x\\)\n\nBy \\(-4a\\)\n\nProd. \\(-32ax\\)\n\n\\(6x\\)\n\n\\(-5a\\)\n\n\\(-30ax\\)\n\n\\(+3ab\\)\n\n\\(-5ac\\)\n\n\\(-15aab\\)\n\nTo multiply compound quantities, you must \"multiply every part of the multiplicand by all the parts of the multiplier, taken one after another, and then collect all the products into one sum: That sum shall be the product required.\"\n\nEXAMPLE. Mult. \\(a + b\\)\n\nBy \\(a + b\\)\n\nProd. \\(\\{aa + ab + ab + bb\\}\\)\n\nSum \\(aa + 2ab + bb\\)\n\nMult. \\(aa + ab + bb\\)\n\nBy \\(a - b\\)\n\nProd. \\(\\{aaa + aab + abb\\}\\)\n\nSum \\(aaa...o...o...bbb\\)\n\nProducts that arise from the multiplication of two, three, or more quantities, as \\(abc\\), are said to be of two, three, or more dimensions; and those quantities are called factors or roots.\n\nIf all the factors are equal, then these products are called powers; as \\(aa\\), or \\(a^2\\), are powers of \\(a\\). Powers are expressed sometimes by placing above the root,\nroot, to the right hand, a figure expressing the number of factors that produce them. Thus,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na & \\quad \\text{called the} \\\\\na^2 & \\quad \\text{Power of the} \\\\\na^3 & \\quad \\text{root } a, \\text{ and} \\\\\na^4 & \\quad \\text{is shortly} \\\\\na^5 & \\quad \\text{expressed} \\\\\na^6 & \\quad \\text{thus,}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThese figures which express the number of factors that produce powers, are called their indices or exponents; thus 2 is the index of \\(a^2\\). And powers of the same root are multiplied by adding their exponents. Thus \\(a^2 \\times a^3 = a^5\\), \\(a^4 \\times a^3 = a^7\\), \\(a^3 \\times a = a^4\\).\n\nSometimes it is useful not actually to multiply compound quantities, but to set them down with the sign of multiplication (\\(\\times\\)) between them, drawing a line over each of the compound factors. Thus \\(a + b \\times a - b\\) expresses the product of \\(a + b\\), multiplied by \\(a - b\\).\n\n**Chap. IV. Of Division.**\n\nThe same rule for the signs is to be observed in division as in multiplication; that is, \"If the signs of the dividend and divisor are like, the sign of the quotient must be + ; if they are unlike, the sign of the quotient must be \u2014.\" This will be easily deduced from the rule in multiplication, if you consider, that the quotient must be such a quantity as, multiplied by the divisor, shall give the dividend.\n\nThe general rule in division is, \"to place the dividend above a small line, and the divisor under it, expunging any letters that may be found in all the quantities of the dividend and divisor, and dividing the coefficients of all the terms by any common measure.\"\n\nThus, when you divide \\(10ab + 15ac\\) by \\(2ad\\), expunging \\(a\\) out of all the terms, and dividing all the coefficients by 5, the quotient is \\(\\frac{2b + 3c}{4d}\\); and\n\n\\[\n2b) ab + bb \\left( \\frac{a + b}{2} \\right).\n\\]\n\nPowers of the same root are divided by subtracting their exponents, as they are multiplied by adding them.\" Thus, if you divide \\(a^5\\) by \\(a^2\\), the quotient is \\(a^{5-2} = a^3\\). And \\(b^6\\) divided by \\(b^4\\) gives \\(b^{6-4} = b^2\\); and \\(a^7b^3\\) divided by \\(a^4b^3\\) gives \\(a^{7-4}b^{3-3} = a^3\\) for the quotient.\n\n\"If the quantity to be divided is compound, then you must range its parts according to the dimensions of some one of its letters, as in the following example.\"\n\nIn the dividend \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), they are ranged according to the dimensions of \\(a\\), the quantity \\(a^2\\), where \\(a\\) is of two dimensions, being placed first, \\(2ab\\), where it is of one dimension, next, and \\(b^2\\), where \\(a\\) is not at all, being placed last. \"The divisor must be ranged according to the dimensions of the same letters; then you are to divide the first term of the dividend by the first term of the divisor, and to set down the quotient, which, in this example, is \\(a\\); then multiply this quotient by the whole divisor, and subtract the product from the dividend, and the remainder shall give a new dividend, which, in this example, is \\(ab + b^2\\).\"\n\n\"Divide the first term of this new dividend by the first term of the divisor, and set down the quotient, (which in this example is \\(b\\)), with its proper sign. Then multiply the whole divisor by this part of the quotient, and subtract the product from the new dividend; and if there is no remainder, the division is finished:\" If there is a remainder, you are to proceed after the same manner, till no remainder is left; or till it appear that there will be always some remainder.\n\nSome examples will illustrate this operation.\n\n**Examp. I.** \\(a + b) a^2 - b^2 (a - b\\)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na^2 & + ab \\\\\n- ab & - b^2 \\\\\n\\hline\n- b^2 & \n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Examp. II.** \\(a-b) aaa - 3aab + 3abb - bbb (aa - 2ab + bb\\)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\naaa & - aab \\\\\n- 2aab & + 3abb - bbb \\\\\n- 2aab & + 2ab \\\\\n\\hline\nabb & - bbb \\\\\nabb & - bbb \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nIt often happens, that the operation may be continued without end, and then you have an infinite series for the quotient; and by comparing the first three or four terms you may find what law the terms observe: by which means, without any more division, you may continue the quotient as far as you please. Thus, in dividing \\(1\\) by \\(1-a\\), you find the quotient to be \\(1 + a + aa + aaa + aaaa + \\&c.\\), which series can be continued as far as you please, by adding the powers of \\(a\\).\n\nThe operation is thus:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1 - a) 1 & (1 + a + aa + aaa + \\&c. \\\\\n1 - a & \\\\\n+ a & \\\\\n+ a - aa & \\\\\n+ aa & \\\\\n+ aa - aaa & \\\\\n+ aaa & \\\\\n+ aaa - aaaa & \\\\\n+ aaaa & \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nNote, The sign \\(\\div\\) placed between any two quantities,\nties, expresses the quotient of the former divided by the latter. Thus, \\( \\frac{a + b}{a - x} \\) is the quotient of \\( a + b \\), divided by \\( a - x \\).\n\n**Chap. V. Of Fractions.**\n\nIn the last chapter it was said, that the quotient of any quantity \\( a \\), divided by \\( b \\), is expressed by placing \\( a \\) above a small line, and \\( b \\) under it, thus, \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\). These quotients are also called fractions; and the dividend, or quantity placed above the line, is called the numerator of the fraction, and the divisor, or quantity placed under the line, is called the denominator.\n\n\"If the numerator of a fraction be equal to the denominator, then the fraction is equal to unity. Thus, \\( \\frac{a}{a} \\) and \\( \\frac{b}{b} \\) are equal to unit. If the numerator is greater than the denominator, then the fraction is greater than unit.\" In both these cases, the fraction is called improper. But \"if the numerator is less than the denominator, then the fraction is less than unit,\" and is called proper. Thus, \\( \\frac{5}{3} \\) is an improper fraction; but \\( \\frac{2}{4} \\) and \\( \\frac{3}{3} \\) are proper fractions. A mixt quantity is that whereof one part is an integer, and the other a fraction. As \\( 3 \\frac{4}{5} \\) and \\( 5 \\frac{2}{3} \\) and \\( a + \\frac{a^2}{b} \\).\n\n**Problem I.**\n\nTo reduce a Mixt quantity to an Improper Fraction.\n\n**Rule.** Multiply the part that is an integer by the denominator of the fractional part; and to the product add the numerator; under their sum place the former denominator.\n\nThus \\( 2 \\frac{1}{3} \\) reduced to an improper fraction gives \\( \\frac{7}{3} \\); \\( a + \\frac{a^2}{b} = \\frac{ab + a^2}{b} \\); and \\( a - x + \\frac{a^2 - ax}{x} = \\frac{a^2 - ax}{x} \\).\n\n**Problem II.**\n\nTo reduce an Improper Fraction to a Mixt Quantity.\n\n**Rule.** Divide the numerator of the fraction by the denominator, and the quotient shall give the integral part; the remainder set over the denominator shall be the fractional part.\n\nThus \\( \\frac{12}{5} = 2 \\frac{2}{5} \\); \\( \\frac{ab + a^2}{b} = a + \\frac{a^2}{b} \\).\n\n**Problem III.**\n\nTo reduce fractions of different denominations to fractions of equal value that shall have the same denominator.\n\n**Rule.** Multiply each numerator, separately taken; into all the denominators but its own, and the products shall give the new numerators. Then multiply all the denominators into one another, and the product shall give the common denominator. Thus,\n\nThe fractions \\( \\frac{a}{b}, \\frac{b}{c}, \\frac{c}{d} \\), are respectively equal to these fractions \\( \\frac{ac}{bd}, \\frac{bd}{cd}, \\frac{cb}{dc} \\), which have the same denominator \\( bcd \\). And the fractions \\( \\frac{1}{7}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{4}{7} \\), are respectively equal to these \\( \\frac{4}{8}, \\frac{4}{5}, \\frac{4}{8} \\).\n\n**Problem IV.**\n\nTo Add and Subtract Fractions.\n\n**Rule.** Reduce them to a common denominator, and add or subtract the numerators; the sum or difference set over the common denominator, is the sum or remainder required.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b} + \\frac{c}{d} + \\frac{d}{e} = \\frac{ade + bce + d^2b}{bed}; \\quad \\frac{a}{b} - \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{ad - bc}{bd};\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{8 + 9}{12} = \\frac{17}{12} = 1 \\frac{5}{12}; \\quad \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{9 - 8}{12} = \\frac{1}{12};\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{5} - \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{16 - 15}{20} = \\frac{1}{20}; \\quad \\frac{x}{2} = \\frac{3x - 2x}{6} = \\frac{x}{6}.\n\\]\n\n**Problem V.**\n\nTo Multiply Fractions.\n\n**Rule.** Multiply their numerators one into another to obtain the numerator of the product; and their denominators multiplied into one another shall give the denominator of the product. Thus,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b} \\times \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{ac}{bd}; \\quad \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{8}{15}.\n\\]\n\nIf a mixt quantity is to be multiplied, first reduce it to the form of a fraction (by Prob. I.). And, if an integer is to be multiplied by a fraction, you may reduce it to the form of a fraction by placing unit under it.\n\n**Example.** \\( 5 \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{17}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{51}{12} \\).\n\n**Problem VI.**\n\nTo Divide Fractions.\n\n**Rule.** Multiply the numerator of the dividend by the denominator of the divisor, their product shall give the numerator of the quotient. Then multiply the denominator of the dividend by the numerator of the divisor, and their product shall give the denominator.\n\nThus, \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\div \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{10}{12} = \\frac{3}{7} \\); \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\div \\frac{35}{24} = \\frac{c}{d} \\); \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\div \\frac{ad}{cb} \\).","sp":111,"ep":115},{"h":"ALGENEB","t":"a fixed star of the second magnitude on the right shoulder of Perseus.

The principal subject is thus kept out of view, and we are left to discover it by reflection. In other words, an allegory is, in every respect, similar to an hieroglyphical painting, excepting only that words are used instead of colours. Their effects are precisely the same: An hieroglyphic raises two images in the mind; one seen, that represents one that is not seen: An allegory does the same; the representative subject is described; and the resemblance leads us to apply the description to the subject represented.\n\nThere cannot be a finer or more correct allegory than the following, in which a vineyard is made to represent God's own people the Jews:\n\n\"Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt; thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it. Thou didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land. The hills were covered with its shadow, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars. Why halt thou then broken down her hedges, so that all that pass do pluck her? The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast doth devour it.

Though writers on arithmetic generally make alligation a branch of that science; yet, as it is plainly nothing more than an application of the common properties of numbers, in order to solve a few questions that occur in particular branches of business, we choose rather to keep it distinct from the science of arithmetic.\n\nAlligation is generally divided into medial or alternate.\n\nI. Alligation Medial.\n\nAlligation medial, from the rates and quantities of the simples given, discovers the rate of the mixture.\n\nRule. As the total quantity of the simples, To their price or value; So any quantity of the mixture, To the rate.\n\nExample. A grocer mixeth 30 lb. of currants, at 4d. per lb. with 10 lb. of other currants, at 6d. per lb.: What is the value of 1 lb. of the mixture. Ans. 4\u00bd d.\n\n| lb. | d. |\n|-----|----|\n| 30  | 4  |\n| 10  | 6  |\n\nAmounts to 120\n\n| lb. | d. |\n|-----|----|\n| 40  | 180 |\n\nIf 40 : 180 :: 1 : 4\u00bd\n\nNote 1. When the quantity of each simple is the same, the rate of the mixture is readily found by adding the rates of the simples, and dividing their sum by the number of simples, thus.\n\nSuppose a grocer mixes several sorts of sugar, and of each an equal quantity, viz. at 50 s. at 54 s. and at 60 s. per Cwt. the rate of the mixture will be 54 s. 8 d. per Cwt.; for,\n\n\\[ \\frac{50 + 54 + 60}{3} = 54 \\text{ s. } 8 \\text{ d.} \\]\n\nNote 2. If it be required to increase or diminish the quantity of the mixture, say, As the sum of the given quantities of the simples, to the several quantities given; so the quantity of the mixture proposed, to the quantities of the simples sought.\n\nNote 3. If it be required to know how much of each simple is in an assigned portion of the mixture, say, As the quantity of the mixture, to the several quantities of the simples given; so the quantity of the assigned portion, to the quantities of the simples sought. Thus,\n\nSuppose a grocer mixes 10 lb. of raisins, with 30 lb. of almonds, and 40 lb. of currants, and it be demanded, how many ounces of each sort are found in every pound, or in every sixteen ounces of the mixture, say,\n\noz.\n\n80 : 10 :: 16 : 2 raisins.\n80 : 30 :: 16 : 6 almonds.\n80 : 40 :: 16 : 8 currants.\n\nProof 16\n\nNote 4. If the rates of two simples, with the total value and total quantity of the mixture be given, the quantity of each simple may be found as follows, viz. multiply the lesser rate into the total quantity, subtract the product from the total value, and the remainder will be equal to the product of the excess of the higher rate above the lower, multiplied into the quantity of the higher-priced simple; and consequently the said remainder, divided by the difference of the rates, will quote the said quantity. Thus,\n\nSuppose a grocer has a mixture of 400 lb weight, that cost him 7l. 10s. consisting of raisins, at 4d. per lb.\nand almonds at 6 d., how many pounds of almonds were in the mixture?\n\n| Lb. | Rates |\n|-----|-------|\n| 400 | 6 d.  |\n| 4   | 4 d.  |\n\n7 10 = 1800\n\n1600 1600 d. 2 d.\n\n2) 200 (100 lb. of almonds at 6 d. is,\n\nAnd 300 lb. of raisins, at 4 d. is,\n\nTotal 400 Proof 7 10\n\nII.

There are eight species of the aloe, viz., the perfoliata, variegata, disticha, spiralis, villosa, pumila, uvaria, and retusa, most of them natives of Africa. The retusa, or pearl aloe, is a very beautiful plant. It is smaller than most of the aloe kind. The leaves are short, very thick, sharp pointed, and turning down with a large thick end, appear there triangular. The colour of the leaves is a fine green, striped in an elegant manner with white, and frequently tipped with red at the point. The flower-stalk, which rises in the midst of the leaves, is round, smooth, of a purple colour, and generally about eight inches high. When the plant has been properly cultivated, the flowers are striped with green and white; and sometimes they are entirely white. This aloe is singular in not having the bitter resinous juice with which the leaves of most others abound; when a leaf of this species is cut, what runs from it is watery, colourless, and perfectly insipid.

Altars differed in figure as well as in materials. Some were round, others square, and others oval. All of them were turned towards the east, and stood lower than the statues of the gods, and were generally adorned with sculpture, inscriptions, and the leaves and flowers of the particular tree consecrated to the deity. Thus, the altars of Jupiter were decked with oak, those of Apollo with laurel, those of Venus with myrtle, and those of Minerva with olive.\n\nThe height of altars also differed according to the different gods to whom they sacrificed. Those of the celestial gods were raised to a great height above the ground; those appointed for the terrestrial, were almost on a level with the surface of the earth. On the contrary, they dug a hole for the altars of the infernal gods.\n\nBefore temples were in use, altars were erected sometimes in groves, sometimes in the highways, and sometimes on the tops of mountains; and it was a custom to engrave upon them the name, ensign, or character of the deity to whom they were consecrated.\n\nIn the great temples of ancient Rome, there were ordinarily three altars: The first was placed in the sanctuary, at the foot of the statue of the divinity, upon which incense was burnt, and libations offered; the second was before the gate of the temple, and upon it they sacrificed the victims; and the third was a portable altar, upon which were placed the offering and the sacred vessels.\n\nBesides these uses of altars, the ancients swore upon them, and swore by them, in making alliances, confirming treaties of peace, and other solemn occasions. Altars also served as places of refuge to all those who fled to them, whatever crime they had committed.\n\nAmong the Jews, altars in the patriarchal times were very rude. The altar which Jacob set up at Bethel was nothing but a stone, which served him instead of a bolster; that of Gideon, a stone before his house; and the first which God commanded Moses to erect was probably of earth, or unpolished stones, without any iron; for if any use was made of that metal, the altar was declared impure.\n\nThe principal altars of the Jews were those of incense, of burnt-offering, and the altar, or table, for the shew-bread.\n\nThe altar of incense was a small table of shittimwood, covered with plates of gold, of one cubit in length, another in width, and two in height.\n\nAt the four corners, were four kinds of horns, and all round a little border or crown over it. This was the altar hidden by Jeremiah before the captivity; and upon it the officiating priest offered, every morning and evening, incense of a particular composition. See plate XI. fig. 2.\n\nThe altar of burnt-offerings was made of shittimwood, and carried upon the shoulders of the priests by slaves of the same wood, overlaid with brafs. In the time of Moses, this altar was five cubits square, and three high; but in Solomon's temple it was much larger, being twenty cubits square, and ten in height. It was covered with brafs; and at each corner was a horn or spire wrought out of the same wood with the altar, to which the sacrifices were tied. Within the hollow was a grate of brafs, on which the fire was made; through it fell the ashes, and were received in a pan below. At the four corners of the grate were four rings, and four chains, which kept it up at the horns. This altar was placed in the open air, that the smoke of the burnt-offerings might not fully the inside of the tabernacle. See plate XI. fig. 3.\n\nThe altar, or table for the shew-bread, was likewise of shittim-wood; covered with plates of gold, having a little border round it, adorned with sculpture. It was two cubits long, one wide, and one and an half in height. Upon this table, which stood in the holy of holies, were put, every sabbath-day, twelve loaves, with salt and incense.\n\nThe Jewish altars, after the return from the captivity, and the building of the second temple, were in some respects different from those described above.\n\nThat of burnt-offerings was a large pile, built of unhewn stones, thirty-two cubits square at the bottom, and twenty-four square at the top. The ascent was by a gentle rising, thirty-two cubits in length, and fifteen in breadth.\n\nAltar is also used among Christians for the communion-table. See Communion-table.\n\nAltar is sometimes also used to denote the offerings made at the altar, in contradistinction from the settled revenues of a church.\n\nAltar, in astronomy. See Ara.\n\nAltar-thane, in old law books, an appellation given to the priest or parson of a parish, to whom the altarage belonged.

Alum, in medicine, is a powerful astringent. In dying, it fixes the colours upon the stuff. See Chemistry.\n\nProcess of making Alum. At Whitby, in Yorkshire, alum is made thus: Having burnt a quantity of the ore with whins, or wood, till it becomes white, then they barrow it in a pit, where it is steeped in water for eight or ten hours. This liquor, or lixivium, is conveyed by troughs to the alum-house, into cisterns, and from them into the pans, where it is boiled about 24 hours. They add a certain quantity of the ice of kelp; the whole is drawn off into a settler; where having remained about an hour, that the sulphur and other dregs may have time to settle to the bottom, it is conveyed into coolers. This done, to every tun of the liquor they add about eight gallons of urine; and having stood four days and nights, till quite cool, the alum begins to crystallize on the sides of the vessel, from which being scraped off, it is washed with fair water, and then thrown in a bing, to let the water drain off. After this it is thrown into a pan, called the roching pan, and there melted; in which state it is conveyed by troughs into tuns, where it stands about 10 days, till perfectly condensed. Then slaving the tuns, the alum is taken out, chipped, and carried to the store-houses.\n\nThis is what we commonly call roche or rock alum, as being prepared from stones cut from the rocks of the quarry; and stands contradistinguished from the common alum, or that prepared from earths.\n\nArtificial Alum, that prepared by art, in contradiction from the native alum. It is also used for alum produced by caufing burnt earthen vessels imbibe a large quantity of oil of vitriol; the effect of which is, that they are thereby reduced to a mucilage, which, being exposed to the open air, affords crystals of pure alum. Tobacco-pipes, wetted with spirit of sulphur, likewise afford beautiful crystals of plumose alum.\n\nBurnt Alum, is that melted in a fire-shovel, or crucible, where it is allowed to bubble till it becomes a white hard substance.\n\nThe watery part of the alum being thus expelled,\nthe remainder is left possessed of all its acids, less clogged, and more in a condition to exert its effects.

Testament: Because Christ's commission to baptize appears to them to restrict this ordinance to such only as are taught, or made disciples, and believe the gospel, Mat. xxviii. 19. Mark xvi. 16.: Because the apostles, in executing Christ's commission, never baptized any but those who were first instructed in the Christian faith, and professed their belief of it, Acts ii. 41. viii. 12. xviii. 8.; And because the nature and design of the ordinance is such as can be of no advantage to infants, it being a sign and representation of spiritual blessings, intended to impress the mind of the person baptized with a comfortable sense of what is signified thereby, 1 Pet. iii. 21.; and as infants can neither discern the sign nor the thing signified, so they think they can reap no benefit from it, any more than from the Lord's supper, or any other ordinance of the gospel.\n\nThey repel the argument drawn from circumcision, by distinguishing betwixt the Old and New Testament dispensations, and betwixt the natural and spiritual seed of Abraham, Rom. ix. 8. Gal. iv. 22, 23, 28, 31, and maintain, that as circumcision belonged to the carnal birth, so baptism belongs only to the spiritual birth, or those who are of faith, Gal. iii. 7.

The argument from the apostles their baptizing whole-houses, they answer, by shewing that these houses heard the word, believed, were comforted, and abounded in good works, Acts xvi. 32, 34, 40. and xviii. 8. 1 Cor. xvi. 15, 16. and so could not be infants.\n\nThe mode or manner of baptism they affirm to be dipping or immersing the whole body in water.

I. Of the Bones in general.**\n\nBefore we examine the structure of the bones, the periosteum, a membrane with which they are covered, must be described.\n\nThe periosteum can be divided into layers of fibres. The exterior ones, composed of the fibres of the muscles connected to the bones, vary in their number, size, and direction, and consequently occasion a very great difference in the thickness and strength of the periosteum of different bones. The internal layer is everywhere nearly of a similar structure, and has its fibres in the same direction with those of the bone to which they are contiguous.\n\nExcept where muscles, cartilages, or ligaments, are inserted into the periosteum, its external surface is connected to the surrounding parts by thin cellular membranes, which can easily be stretched considerably, but shorten themselves whenever the stretching force is removed.\n\nWhen the periosteum is torn off from bones, we see a great number of white threads produced from that membrane into them; and after a successful injection of the arteries with a red liquor, numerous vessels are not only seen on the periosteum, but most of the fibres sent from the membrane to the bone show themselves to be vessels entering it, with the injected liquor in them; and when they are broken, by tearing off the periosteum, the surface of the bone is almost covered with red points.\n\nThe great sensibility of the periosteum in the deep-seated species of paronychia, in exostoses, nodi, tophi, and gummatata, from a lues venerea, or whenever this membrane is in an inflamed state, is a sufficient proof that it is well provided with nerves; though they are perhaps too small to be traced.\n\nThe chief uses of the periosteum are: 1. To allow the muscles, when they contract or are stretched, to move...\n2nd side easily upon the bones. 2. To keep in due order, and to support the vessels in their passage to the bones. 3. By being firmly braced on the bones, to assist in setting limits to their increase, and to check their overgrowth. 4. To strengthen the conjunction of the bones with their epiphyses, ligaments, and cartilages, which are easily separated in young creatures, when this membrane is taken away. 5. To afford convenient origin and insertion to several muscles which are fixed to this membrane. And, lastly, to warn us when any injury is offered to the parts it covers.\n\nThe Bones are the most hard and solid parts of the body, and generally of a white colour; only in a living creature they are bluish, which is owing to the blood in the small vessels under their surface.\n\nBones are composed of a great many plates, each of which is made up of fibres or strings united by smaller fibrils; which being irregularly disposed and interwoven with the other larger fibres, make a reticular work.\u2014This texture is plainly seen in the bones of fetuses, which have not their parts closely compacted, and in the bones of adults, which have been burnt, long exposed to the weather, or whose composition has been made loose by diseases.\n\nThe plates are said to be firmly joined to each other by a great number of clavicles, or small bony processes, which, rising from the inner plates, pierce through some, and are fixed into the more external ones.\n\nThough the exterior part of bones is composed of firm compact plates, yet they are all more or less cavernous internally. In some, the solid sides are brought so near, that little cavity can be seen; and in others, the cavities are so large, that such bones are generally esteemed to be hollow or sifflar. But the internal spongy texture is most evident in young animals.\n\nThis spongy, cavernous, internal part of bones, is generally called their cancelli or lattice-work.\n\nThe twisting and windings which these cancelli make, and the interfaces which they leave, differ considerably in figure, number, and size; and therefore form little cells, which are as different, but communicate with each other.\n\nThe cancelli sustain the membranous bags of the marrow which are stretched upon them, and thereby hinder these membranous parts from being torn or removed out of their proper places, in the violent motions and different postures which the bones are employed in.\n\nThe depressions between the fibres of the external plates of bones appear like so many furrows on their surface, into each of which the periosteum enters.\n\nBoth on the ridges and furrows, numerous little pits or orifices of canals are to be seen, by which the vessels pass to and from the bones.\n\nAfter a successful injection, the arteries can be traced in their course from the pits to the plates and fibres.\n\nWe may conclude, from arteries being accompanied with veins, so far as we can trace them in every other part of the body, that there are also veins in the bones.\n\nThe bones of a living animal are so inflexible that they cannot be cut, rasped, or burnt, without putting the creature to pain, and the nerves distributed in their substance cannot be strewed by dissection; from which it might be inferred, that they have no nerves distributed to them: But the general tenor of nature, which befores nerves to all the other parts, should prevent our drawing such a conclusion.\n\nThe vascular texture of bones must make them subject to obstructions, ecchymoses, ulcers, gangrenes, and most other diseases which the softer parts are affected with; and therefore there may be a greater variety of caries than is commonly described.\n\nOn the internal surface of the solid parts of bones, there are orifices of canals, which pass outwards through the plates to open into other canals that are in a longitudinal direction, from which other transverse passages go out to terminate in other longitudinal canals; and this structure is continued through the whole substance of bones, both these kinds of canals becoming smaller gradually as they approach the outer surface.\u2014These canals are to be seen to the best advantage in a bone burnt till it is white: When it is broken transversely, the orifices of the longitudinal canals are in view; and when we separate the plates, the transverse ones are to be observed.\n\nMost bones have one or more large oblique canals formed through their sides for the passage of the medullary vessels.\n\nThe bones sustain and defend the other parts of the body.\n\nBones are lined within, as well as covered externally, with a membrane; which is therefore commonly called periosteum internum.\n\nThe internal periosteum is an extremely fine membrane; nay, frequently it has a loose reticular texture; and therefore it is compared by some to the arachnoid coat of the spinal marrow: so that we cannot expect to divide it into layers as we can divide the external periosteum. We can, however, observe its processes entering into the transverse pores of the bones, where probably they are continued to form the immediate canals for the marrow distributed through the substance of the bones; and along with them vessels are sent, as from the external periosteum, into the bone. These processes being of a very delicate texture, the adhesion of this membrane to the bone is so small, that it separates commonly more easily from the bone than from the marrow which it contains.\n\nFrom the internal surface of the internal periosteum, a great number of thin membranes are produced; which, passing across the cavity, unite with others of the same kind, and form so many distinct bags, which communicate with each other; and these again are subdivided into communicating vesicular cells, in which the marrow is contained.\n\nThe Marrow is the oily part of the blood, separated by small arteries, and deposited in these cells. Its colour and consistence may therefore vary according to the state of the vessels, and their distribution on the membranes of the cells.\n\nBesides the arteries already mentioned as being sent from the bones to the marrow, there is at least one artery for each bone; several bones have more, whose principal use is to convey and secrete this oily matter.\nThe blood, which remains after the secretion of the marrow, is returned by proper veins, which are collected from the membranes into one or two large trunks, to pass out at the same holes at which the arteries enter.\n\nThe vessels of the marrow, wrapped up in one common coat from the periosteum, pass through the bones by proper canals; the most considerable of which are about the middle of each bone, and are very oblique.\n\nFrom the structure of the contents of the bones, we may judge how these parts, as well as others, may be subject to oedema, phlegmon, erysipelas, schirrhus, &c., and may thence be led to a cure of each, before the common consequence, putrefaction, takes place, and frequently occasions the loss of the limb, if not of the patient.\n\nThe marrow is of very considerable use to the bones; for by entering their transverse canals, and passing from them into the longitudinal ones, it is communicated to all the plates, to soften and connect their fibres, whereby they are preserved from becoming too brittle.\n\nWhen the marrow, after having served the uses mentioned, is reassumed into the mass of blood, it corrects the too great acrimony communicated to the saline particles of our fluids by their circulation and heat; in the same manner as lye is blunted by oil in making soap.\n\nSince it is the nature of all oil to become thin and rancid when exposed long to heat, and bones have much oil in their firm hard substance, we may know why an ungrateful smell, and dark-coloured thin ichor, proceed more from corrupted bones than from other parts of the body; and we can understand the reason of the changes of colour which bones undergo, according to their different degrees of mortification.\n\nThough bones so far agree in their structure and annexed parts, yet we may observe a considerable difference among them in their magnitude, figure, situation, substance, connection, uses, &c. Of these we shall only mention two, viz. that some bones are broad and flat, while others are long and round.\n\nThe broad bones have thin sides, by the plates being soon and equally sent off to form the lattice-work; which therefore is thicker, and nearly of an equal form all through. By this structure, they are well adapted to their uses, of affording a large enough surface for the muscles to rise from, and move upon, and of defending sufficiently the parts which they inclose.\n\nThe round bones have thick strong walls in the middle, and become very thin towards their ends, which is owing to very few plates separating at their middle; where, on that account, the cancelli are so fine and small that they are not taken notice of: But such bones are said to have a large reservoir of oil in this place. Towards their ends the lattice-work becomes very thick, and rather more complete than in the other sort of bones.\n\nThese round bones having strong forces naturally applied to them, and being otherwise exposed to violent injuries, have need of a cylindrical figure to resist external pressure, and of a considerable quantity of oil to preserve them from becoming too brittle. Besides which, they are advantageously provided with thick sides towards their middle, where the greatest forces are applied to injure them; while their hollowness increases their diameter, and consequently their strength, to resist forces applied to break them transversely.\n\nMany bones have protuberances, or processes, rising out from them. If a process stands out in a roundish ball, it is called capitulum, or head.\u2014If the head is flattened, it obtains the appellation of condyle.\u2014A rough unequal protuberance is called tubercle.\u2014When a process rises narrow, and then becomes large, the narrow or small part is named cervix, or neck.\u2014Long ridges of bones are called spines.\u2014Such processes as terminate in a sharp point, have the general name of corona, or coronoid, bestowed on them, though most of them receive particular names from the resemblance they have, or are imagined to have, to other substances, e.g., mastoid, styloid, &c.\u2014Such processes as form brims of cavities, are called supercilia.\n\nProcesses serve for the advantageous origin and insertion of muscles, and render the articulations firm and stable.\n\nIn children these processes are real epiphyses, or distinct bones, which are afterwards united to the other parts; such are the styloid processes of the temporal bones, processes of the vertebrae, trochanters of the thigh, &c.\n\nOn the surfaces of a great many of the bones there are cavities, or depressions: If these are deep, with large brims, authors name them cotyles; if they are superficial, they obtain the designation of glena, or glenoid. These general classes are again divided into several species:\u2014Of which pits are small roundish channels sunk perpendicularly into the bone;\u2014furrows are long narrow canals, formed in the surface;\u2014nitches or notches, small breaches in the bone;\u2014sinuities, broad, but superficial depressions without brims;\u2014septa, large deep cavities, which are not equally surrounded by high brims;\u2014sinuses, large cavities within the substance of the bones, with small apertures;\u2014foramina, or holes, canals that pierce quite through the substance of the bones.\u2014When this last sort of cavity is extended any long way within a bone, the middle part retains the name of canal, and its ends are called holes.\n\nThe cavities allow the heads of bones to play in them; they lodge and defend other parts; they afford safe passage to vessels, muscles, &c.\n\nTo far the greater number of bones, whose ends are not joined to other bones by an immovable articulation, there are smaller ones annexed, which afterwards become scarce distinguishable from the substance of the bone itself. These are called epiphyses, or appendices. Some bones have one, others have two, three, or four of these appendices annexed by the means of cartilages, which are of a considerable thickness in children, but by age become thinner.\n\nSeveral processes (e.g., trochanters of the thigh, spine of the scapula, &c.) have epiphyses; and processes frequently rise out from epiphyses; for example, at the lower end of the femur, ulna, tibia, &c.\n\nThe epiphyses are united chiefly to such bones as are destined for frequent and violent motion; and for this purpose they are wisely framed of a larger diameter than the\nthe bone they belong to; for by this means, the surface of contact between the two bones of any articulation being increased, their conjunction becomes firmer, and the muscles inserted into them act with greater force, by reason of their axes being further removed from the center of motion.\n\nThe softness of the ends of bones may be of some advantage in the womb, and at birth, after which the ossification begins at different points to form epiphyses, before the ossification can extend from the middle to the ends of the bones.\n\nHowever solid and compact adult bones are, yet they were once cartilages, membranes, nay, a mere jelly. This needs no further proof, than repeated observations of embryos when dissected: And how much more tender must the bones be before that time, when neither knife nor eye is capable to discover the least rudiments of them? By degrees they become more solid, then assume the nature of gristles, and at last ossify; the cohesion of their plates and fibres always increasing in proportion to their increased solidities; as is evident from the time necessary to unravel the texture of bones of people of different ages, or of dense and of spongy bones, or of the different parts of the same bone, and from the more tedious exfoliations of the bones of adults than of children.\n\nThe ossification of bones depends principally on their vessels being so disposed, and of such diameters, as to separate a liquor, which may easily turn into a bony substance, when it is deprived of its thinner parts; as seems plain from the observation of the callous matter separated after fractures and ulcers, where part of the bone is taken out: For in these cases, the vessels extending themselves, and the liquors added to them, are gradually formed into granulated flesh; which fills up all the space where the bone is taken from, then hardens, till it becomes as firm as any other part of the bone. This happens frequently, even when the ends of the diseased bone are at a considerable distance from each other.\n\nThe induration of bones is also greatly assisted by their being exposed, more than any other parts, to the strong pressure of the great weights they support, to the violent contraction of the muscles fixed to them, and to the force of the parts they contain, which endeavour to make way for their own further growth. By all this pressing force, the solid fibres and vessels of bones are thrust closer; and such particles of the fluids conveyed in these vessels as are fit to be united to the fibres, are sooner and more firmly incorporated with them, while the remaining fluids are forcibly driven out by the veins, to be mixed with the mass of blood. In consequence of this, the vessels gradually diminish as the bones harden. From which again we can understand one reason, why the bones of young animals sooner re-unite after a fracture than those of old; and why cattle that are put too soon to hard labour, seldom are of such large size as others of the same breed, who are longer kept from labour.\n\nFrom the effects of pressure only it is, that we can account for the bones of old people having their sides much thinner, yet more dense and solid, while the cavities are much larger than those of young people; and for the prints of muscles, vessels, &c., being so much more strongly marked on the surfaces of the former than of the latter, if they belong to people of near the same condition in life.\u2014Pressure must likewise be the cause, which, in people of equal ages, makes these prints stronger in the bones of those who had much labour and exercise, than they are in people who have led an indolent inactive life.\n\nHaving thus considered the bones when single, we shall next shew the different manner of their conjunctions. To express these, anatomists have contrived a great number of technical terms; about the meaning, propriety, and clasping of which, there has been a variety of opinions. Some of these terms it is necessary to retain, since they serve to express the various circumstances of the articulations, and to understand the writers on this subject.\n\nThe Articulations are most commonly divided into three classes, viz. Symphyses, Synarthroses, and Diarthroses.\n\nSymphyses, which properly signifies the concretion or growing together of parts, when used to express the articulations of bones, does not seem to comprehend, under the meaning generally given to it, anything relating to the form or motion of the conjoined bones; but by most authors only denote the bones to be connected by some other substance; and as there are different substances which serve this purpose, therefore they divide it into the three following species:\n\n1. Synchondrosis, when a cartilage is the connecting substance: Thus the ribs are joined to the sternum; thus the bodies of the vertebrae are connected to each other; as are likewise the osa pubis.\n\n2. Synarthrosis, or Syndesmosis, when ligaments are the connecting bodies, as they are in all the moveable articulations.\n\n3. Suture, when muscles are stretched from one bone to another, as they must be where there are moveable joints.\n\nThe second class of articulations, the Synarthroses, which is said to be the general term by which the immoveable conjunction of bones is expressed, is divided into three kinds.\n\n1. The suture is that articulation where two bones are mutually indented into each other, or as if they were sewed together. Thus the bones of the head are joined; thus epiphyses are joined to the bones, before their full connection and union with them.\n\n2. Gomphosis is the fixing one bone into another, as a nail is fixed in a board: Thus the teeth are secured in their sockets.\n\n3. Schindylisis, or ploughing, when a thin lamella of one bone is received into a long narrow furrow of another: Thus the processus zygomaticus of the sphenoid, and the nasal process of the ethmoid bone, are received by the vomer.\n\nThe third class, or Diarthroses, is the articulation where the bones are so loosely connected as to allow large motion. This is subdivided into three kinds.\nThe first is *enarthrosis*, or the ball and socket, when a large head is received into a deep cavity; as the head of the os femoris is into the acetabulum cox\u00e6.\n\nThe second is *arthrodia*, when a round head is received into a superficial cavity; as in the articulation of the arm-bone and scapula. These two species of diarthrosis allow motion to all sides.\n\nThe third is *ginglimus*, which properly signifies the hinge of a door or window; in it the parts of the bones mutually receive and are received, and allow of motion two ways: Workmen call it *charnal*.\n\nThe ginglimus is generally divided into three kinds, to which some give the names of contiguous, distant, and compound.\n\nThe first kind of ginglimus is, when a bone has several protuberances and cavities, which answer to as many cavities and processes of the other bone, with which it is articulated; as in the conjunction of the femur with the tibia.\n\nThe second species is, when a bone receives another at one end, and is received by the same bone at the other end; as in the radius and ulna.\n\nThe last sort is, when a bone receives another, and is received by a third; as in the oblique processes of the vertebrae.\n\nIf the moveable bones are not connected and kept firm by some strong substance, they would be luxated at every motion of the joints: and if their hard, rough, unequal surfaces were to play on each other, their motion would not only be difficult, but the loss of substance from attrition would be great. Therefore ligaments are made to obviate the first, and cartilages to prevent the other inconvenience. But because ligaments and cartilages turn rigid, inflexible, and rough, unless they are kept moist, a sufficient quantity of proper liquor is supplied for their lubrication, and to preserve them in a flexible state. Seeing then these parts are so necessary to the articulations, we shall next consider their structure, situation, and uses, so far as they are subservient to the bones, and their motions.\n\n**Ligaments** are white flexible bodies, thicker and firmer than membranes, and not so hard or firm as cartilages, without any remarkable cavity in their substance, difficulty stretched, and with little elasticity; serving to connect one part to another, or to prevent the parts to which they are fixed from being removed out of that situation which is useful and safe.\n\nAfter maceration in water, the ligaments can easily be divided; and each ligamentous layer appears composed of fibres, the largest of which are disposed in a longitudinal direction.\n\nThe arteries of ligaments are very conspicuous after a tolerable injection, and the larger trunks of their veins are sometimes to be seen full of blood.\n\nSuch ligaments as form the sides of cavities, have numerous orifices of their arteries opening upon their internal surface, which keep it always moist: If we rub off that moisture, and then press the ligament, we can see the liquor ouzing out from small pores; and we can force thin liquors, injected by the arteries, into the cavities formed by ligaments.\n\nThese exhalent arteries must have corresponding absorbent veins, otherwise the cavities would soon be too full of liquor.\n\nLigaments then must be subject to the diseases common to other parts, where there is a circulation of fluids, allowance always being made for the size of vessels, nature of the fluids, and firmness of the texture of each part.\n\nSome authors have alleged, that ligaments are insensible, and consequently that they have no nerves. But the violent racking pain felt on the least motion of a joint labouring under a rheumatism, the seat of which disease seems often to be in the ligaments, and the sufferable torture occasioned by incisions of ligaments, and by a collection of acid matter in a joint, or by tophi in the gout, would persuade us, that they are abundantly supplied with nerves.\n\nThe ligaments which connect the moveable bones commonly rise from the conjunction of the epiphyses of the one bone, and are inserted into the same place of the other; or where epiphyses are not, they come out from the cervix, and beyond the supercilia of the articulated bones; and after such a manner, in both cases, as to include the articulation in a purse or bag; with this difference, depending on their different motions, that where the motion is only to be in two directions, the ligaments are strongest on those sides towards which the bones are not moved; and when a great variety of motions is designed to be allowed, the ligaments are weaker than in the former sort of articulations, and are nearly of the same strength all round.\n\nPart of the capsular ligaments is composed of the periosteum, continued from one bone to another, and their internal layer is continued on the parts of the bone or cartilage which the ligament includes.\n\nBesides these common capsular ligaments of the joints, there are particular ones in several places, either for the firmer connection of the articulated bones, or for restraining and confining the motion to some one side; such are the crofs and lateral ligaments of the knee, the round one of the thigh, &c.\n\nFrom this account of the ligaments, we may conclude, that, *ceteris paribus*, in whatever articulation the ligaments are few, long, and weak, the motion is more free and quick; but luxations happen frequently: And, on the contrary, where the ligaments are numerous, short, and strong, the motion is more confined; but such a joint is less exposed to luxations.\u2014Whence we may judge how necessary it is to attend to the different ligaments, and the changes which have been made on them by a luxation, when it is to be reduced.\n\nLigaments also supply the place of bones in several cases to advantage: Thus the parts in the pelvis are more safely supported below by ligaments, than they could have been by bone.\u2014The ligaments placed in the great holes of the osa innominata, and between the bones of the fore-arm and leg, afford convenient origin to muscles.\u2014Immoveable bones are firmly connected by them;\nof which the conjunction of the os sacrum and innominatum is an example.\u2014They afford a socket for moveable bones to play in, as we see part of the astragalus does on the ligament stretched from the heel-bone to the scaphoid.\n\nNumerous inconveniences may arise from too long or short, strong or weak, lax or rigid ligaments.\n\nCartilages are solid, smooth, white elastic substances, between the hardness of bones and ligaments, and covered with a membrane, named perichondrium, which is of the same structure and use to them as the periosteum is to the bones.\n\nCartilages are composed of plates, which are formed of fibres, disposed much in the same way as those of bones are; as might be reasonably concluded from observing bones in a cartilaginous state before they ossify, and from seeing, on the other hand, so many cartilages become bony. This may be still further confirmed, by the exfoliation which cartilages are subject to, as well as bones.\n\nThe perichondrium of several cartilages, for example, those of the ribs and larynx, has arteries which can be equally well injected with those of the periosteum.\n\nThe granulated flesh which rises from the ends of metacarpal or metatarsal bones, when the cartilage exfoliates, after a finger or toe has been taken off at the first joint, is very sensible, from which the existence of nerves in cartilages may be inferred.\n\nWhile cartilages are in a natural state, it is to be remarked, first, That they have no cavity in their middle for marrow. Secondly, That their outer surface is soft, which renders them more flexible. Thirdly, That they do not appear to change their texture near so much by acids as bones do. And, lastly, That as the specific gravity of cartilages is near a third less than that of bones, so the cohesion of their several plates is not so strong as in bones; whence cartilages laid bare in wounds or ulcers, are not only more liable to corrupt, but exfoliate much sooner than bones do.\n\nCartilages seem to be principally kept from ossifying, either by being subjected to alternate motions of flexion and extension, the effects of which are very different from any kind of simple pressure, or by being constantly moistened: Thus, the cartilages on the articulated ends of the great bones of the limbs, and the moveable ones placed between the moving bones in some articulations, which are obliged to suffer many and different flexions, and are plentifully moistened, scarce ever change into bone; while those of the ribs and larynx are often ossified.\n\nThe cartilages subservient to bones, are sometimes found on the ends of bones which are joined to no other; but are never wanting on the ends, and in the cavities of such bones as are designed for motion.\n\nThe uses of cartilages, so far as they regard bones, are, to allow, by their smoothness, such bones as are designed for motion, to slide easily without friction, while, by their flexibility, they accommodate themselves to the several figures necessary in different motions, and, by their elasticity, they recover their natural position and shape as soon as the pressure is removed.\n\nThis springy force may also assist the motion of the joint to be more expeditious, and may render shocks in running, jumping, &c., less.\u2014To these cartilages we chiefly owe the security of the moveable articulations: For without them the bony fibres would sprout out, and intimately coalesce with the adjoining bone; whence a true anchylosis must necessarily follow; which never fails to happen when the cartilages are eroded by acid matter, or ossified from want of motion or defect of liquor, as we see often happens after wounds of the joints, painedarthrocece, scrophula, and spina ventosa, or from old age, and long immobility of joints. The moveable cartilages interposed in joints, serve to make the motions both freer and more safe than they would otherwise be.\n\nThose placed on the ends of bones that are not articulated, as on the spine of the os ilium, base of the scapula, &c., serve to prevent the bony fibres from growing out too far.\u2014Cartilages sometimes serve as ligaments, either to fasten together bones that are immovably joined, such as the cartilages between the os sacrum and osa ilium, the osa pubis, &c., or to connect bones that enjoy manifest motion, as those do which are placed between the bodies of the true vertebrae, &c.\u2014Cartilages very often do the office of bones to greater advantage, than these last could, as in the cartilages of the ribs, those which supply brims to cavities, &c.\n\nToo great thicknesses or thinnesses, length or shortnesses, hardnesses or supplefeness of cartilages, may therefore cause great disorders in the body.\n\nThe liquor, which principally serves to moisten the ligaments and cartilages of the articulations, is supplied by glands, which are commonly situated in the joint, after such a manner as to be gently pressed, but not destroyed by its motion. By this means, when there is the greatest necessity for this liquor, that is, when the most frequent motions are performed, the greatest quantity of it must be separated. These glands are soft and pappy, but not friable: In some of the large joints they are of the conglomerate-kind, or a great number of small glandules are wrapped up in one common membrane. Their excretory ducts are long, and hang loose, like so many fringes, within the articulation; which, by its motion and pressure, prevents obstructions in the body of the gland or its excretories, and promotes the return of this liquor, when fit to be taken up by the absorbent vessels, which must be in the joints, as well as in the other cavities of the body; and, at the same time, the pressure on the excretory ducts hinders a superfluous unnecessary secretion, while the fimbriated disposition of these excretories does not allow any of the secreted liquor to be pushed back again by these canals towards the glands.\n\nVery often these fountains of slimy liquor appear only as a net-work of vessels.\u2014Frequently they are almost concealed by cellular membranes containing the fat;\u2014and sometimes small simple mucous folliculi may be seen.\n\nThe different joints have these organs in different numbers and sizes; the conglomerate ones don't vary much, especially as to situation, in the similar joints of different bodies; but the others are more uncertain.\n\nUpon pressing any of these glands with the finger, one can\ncan squeeze out of their excretories a mucilaginous liquor, which somewhat resembles the white of an egg, or serum of the blood; but it is manifestly felt to the taste. It does not coagulate by acids or by heat, as the serum does, but by the latter turns first thinner, and, when evaporated, leaves only a thin salt film.\n\nThe vessels which supply liquors for making the secretion of this mucilage, and the veins which bring back the blood remaining after the secretion, are to be seen without any preparation; and, after a tolerable injection of the arteries, the glands are covered with them.\n\nIn a sound state, we are not conscious of any sensibility in those glands; but, in some cases, when they inflame and suppurate, the most racking pain is felt in them: a melancholy, though a sure proof that they have nerves.\n\nThese mucilaginous glands are commonly lodged in a cellular substance; which is also to be observed in other parts of the bag formed by the ligaments of the articulation; and contains a fatty matter, that must necessarily be attenuated, and forced through the including membranes into the cavity of the joint, by the pressure which it suffers from the moving bones.\n\nAfter the liquor of the articulations becomes too thin and unserviceable, by being constantly pounded and rubbed between the moving bones, it is reassumed into the mass of blood by the absorbent vessels.\n\n**Sect. II. Of the Skeleton.**\n\nAmong anatomists, Skeleton is universally understood to signify the bones of animals connected together, after the teguments, muscles, bowels, glands, nerves, and vessels are taken away.\n\nA skeleton is said to be a natural one, when the bones are kept together by their own ligaments; and it is called artificial, when the bones are joined with wire, or any other substance which is not part of the creature to which they belonged.\n\nThe human skeleton is generally divided into the Head, the Trunk, the Superior and the Inferior Extremities.\n\n**Of the Head.**\n\nBy the Head is meant all that spheroidal part which is placed above the first bone of the neck. It therefore comprehends the cranium and bones of the face.\n\nThe cranium, helmet, or brain-case, consists of several pieces, which form a vaulted cavity, for lodging and defending the brain and cerebellum, with their membranes, vessels, and nerves.\n\nThe cavity of the cranium is proportioned to its contents. Hence such a variety of its size is observed in different subjects; and hence it is neither so broad nor so deep at its fore-part, in which the anterior lobes of the brain are lodged, as it is behind, where the large posterior lobes of the brain, and the whole cerebellum, are contained.\n\nThe external surface of the upper part of the cranium is very smooth, and equal, being only covered with the periosteum, (common to all the bones; but in the skull, distinguished by the name of pericranium), the thin frontal and occipital muscles, their tendinous aponeurosis, and with the common teguments of the body; while the external surface of its lower part has numerous risings, depressions, and holes, which afford convenient origin and insertion to the muscles that are connected to it, and allow safe passage for the vessels and nerves that run through and near it.\n\nThe internal surface of the upper part of the skull is commonly smooth, except where the vessels of the dura mater have made furrows in it, while the bones were soft.\u2014Surgeons should be cautious when they trepan here, lest, in sawing or raising the bone where such furrows are, they wound these vessels.\u2014In the upper part of the internal surface of several skulls, there are likewise pits of different magnitudes and figures, which seem to be formed by some parts of the brain being more luxuriant and prominent than others. Where these pits are, the skull is so much thinner than anywhere else, that it is often rendered diaphanous, the two tables being closely compacted without a diploe; the want of which is supplied by vessels going from the dura mater into a great many small holes observable in the pits.\u2014The knowledge of these pits should teach surgeons to saw cautiously and slowly through the external table of the skull, when they are performing the operation of the trepan; since, in a patient whose cranium has these pits, the dura mater and brain may be injured, before the instrument has pierced near the ordinary thickness of a table of the skull.\u2014The internal base of the skull is extremely unequal for lodging the several parts and appendices of the brain and cerebellum, and allowing passage and defense to the vessels and nerves that go into, or come out from these parts.\n\nThe bones of the cranium are composed of two tables, and intermediate cancelli, commonly called their diploe. The external table is thickest; the inner, from its thinness and consequent brittleness, has got the name of vitrea.\n\nThe diploe has much the same texture and uses in the skull, as the cancelli have in other bones.\n\nThe diploe of several old subjects is so obliterated, that scarce any vestige of it can be seen; neither is it observable in some of the hard craggy bones at the base of the skull. Hence an useful caution to surgeons who trust to the bleeding, want of resistance, and change of sound, as certain marks, in the operation of the trepan, for knowing when their instrument has sawed through the first table, and reached the diploe.\n\nThe cranium consists of eight bones, five of which are said to be proper, and the other two are reckoned common to it and to the face.\u2014The five proper are, the os frontis, two ossa parietalia, two ossa temporum, and the os occipitis.\u2014The common are, the os ethmoides, and sphenoides.\n\nThe os frontis forms the whole fore-part of the vault; the two ossa parietalia form the upper and middle part of it; the osa temporum compose the lower part of the sides;\nsides; the os occipitis makes the whole hinder-part, and some of the base; the os ethmoides is placed in the fore-part of the base; and the os sphenoides is in the middle of it.\n\nThese bones are joined to each other by five sutures; the names of which are, the coronal, lambdoid, sagittal, and two squamosus.\n\nThe coronal suture is extended over the head, from within an inch or so of the external canthus of one eye, to the like distance from the other; which being near the place where the ancients wore their vittae, coronae, or garlands, this suture has hence got its name.\u2014Though the indentations of this suture are conspicuous in its upper part, yet an inch or more of its end on each side has none of them; for it is squamosus and smooth there.\n\nThe lambdoidal suture begins some way below, and farther back than the vertex or crown of the head, whence its two legs are stretched obliquely downwards, and to each side, in the form of the Greek letter \u039b, and are generally said to extend themselves to the base of the skull.\n\nThis suture is sometimes very irregular, being made up of a great many small sutures, which surround so many little bones that are generally larger and more conspicuous on the external surface of the skull than internally. These bones are generally called trigonum, or lamina.\n\nThe sagittal suture is placed longitudinally, in the middle of the upper part of the skull, and commonly terminates at the middle of the coronal, and of the lambdoid sutures; between which it is said to be placed, as an arrow is between the string and bow.\u2014However, this suture is frequently continued through the middle of the os frontis, down to the root of the nose; which often happens in women than men.\n\nThe squamosus agglutinations, or false sutures, are one on each side, a little above the ear, of a semicircular figure, formed by the overlapping (like one scale upon another) of the upper part of the temporal bones, on the lower part of the parietal, where, in both bones, there are a great many small risings and furrows, which are indented into each other; though these inequalities do not appear till the bones are separated.\n\nThe bones of the skull are joined to those of the face by schyzodesis and sutures.\u2014The schyzodesis is in the partition of the nose.\u2014The sutures said to be common to the cranium and face are five, viz., the ethmoidal, sphenoidal, transverse, and two zygomatic.\u2014Parts however of these sutures are at the junction of only the bones of the skull.\n\nThe ethmoidal and sphenoidal sutures surround the bones of these names; and in some places help to make up other sutures, particularly the squamosus and transverse; and, in other parts, there is but one suture common to these two bones.\n\nThe transverse suture is extended quite across the face, from the external canthus of one orbit, to the same place of the other.\n\nThe zygomatic sutures are one on each side, being short, and slanting from above obliquely, downwards and backwards, to join a process of the cheek-bone to one of the temporal bones, which advances towards the face; so that the two processes thus united, form a sort of bridge or jugum, under which the temporal muscle passes; on which account the processes, and sutures joining them, have been called zygomatic.\n\nThe advantages of the sutures of the cranium are these: 1. That this capsule is more easily formed and extended into a spherical figure, than if it had been one continued bone. 2. That the bones which are at some distance from each other at birth might then yield, and allow to the head a change of shape, accommodated to the passage it is engaged in. Whence, in hard labour of child-bed, the bones of the cranium, instead of being only brought into contact, are sometimes made to mount one upon the other. 3. That the dura mater may be more firmly suspended by its processes, which infuse themselves into this conjunction of the bones; for doing this equally, and where the greatest necessity of adhesion is, the sutures are disposed at nearly equal distances, and the large reservoirs of blood, the sinuses, are under or near them. 4. That fractures might be prevented from reaching so far as they would in a continued bony substance. 5. That the connection at the sutures being capable of yielding, the bones might be allowed to separate; which has given great relief to patients from the violent symptoms which they had before this separation happened.\n\nHaving gone through the general structure of the cranium, we now proceed to examine each bone of which that brain-case consists.\n\nThe Os Frontis has its name from its being the only bone of that part of the face we call the forehead, though it reaches a good deal further. It has some resemblance in shape to the shell of the concha-bivalvis, commonly called the cockle; for the greatest part of it is convex externally, and concave internally, with a serrated circular edge; while the smaller part has processes and depressions, which make it of an irregular figure.\n\nThe external surface of the os frontis is smooth at its upper convex part; but several processes and cavities are observable below: for, at each angle of each orbit, the bone juts out to form four processes, two internal, and as many external; which, from this situation, may well enough be named angular. Between the internal and external angular processes of each side, an arched ridge is extended, on which the eye-brows are placed.\u2014Very little above the internal end of each of these superciliary ridges, a protuberance may be remarked, in most skulls, where there are large cavities, called sinuses, within the bone.\u2014Betwixt the internal angular processes, a small process rises, which forms some share of the nose, and thence is named nasal.\u2014Some observe a protuberant part on the edge of the bone, behind each external angular process, which they call temporal processes; but these are inconceivable.\u2014From the under part of the superciliary ridges, the frontal bone runs a great way backwards; which parts may justly enough be called orbital processes. These, contrary to the rest of this bone, are concave externally, for receiving the globes of the eyes, with their muscles, fat, &c.\n\nIn each of the orbital processes, behind the middle of the superciliary ridges, a considerable sinuosity is observed,\nwhere the glandula innominata Galeni, or lachrymalis, is lodged.\u2014Behind each internal angular process, a small pit may be remarked, where the cartilaginous pully of the musculus obliquus major of the eye is fixed.\u2014Betwixt the two orbital processes, there is a large discontinuation of the bone, into which the cribriform part of the os ethmoides is incased.\u2014The frontal bone frequently has little caverns formed in it here where it is joined to the ethmoid bone.\u2014Behind each external angular process, the surface of the frontal bone is considerably depressed where part of the temporal muscle is placed.\n\nThe foramina, or holes, observable on the external surface of the frontal bone, are three in each side.\u2014One in each superciliary ridge, a little removed from its middle towards the nose; through which a twig of the ophthalmic branch of the fifth pair of nerves passes out of the orbit, with a small artery, from the internal carotid, to be distributed to the teguments and muscles of the forehead.\u2014These vessels in some skulls make furrows in the os frontis, especially in the bones of children; and therefore we ought to beware of transverse incisions on either side of the os frontis, which might either open these vessels or hurt the nerves, while they are yet in part within the bone; for, when vessels are thus wounded, it is difficult to stop the hemorrhage, because the adhesion of a part of the artery to the bone hinders its contraction, and consequently styptic can have little effect; the sides of the furrow keep off compressing substances from the artery; and we would with to shun cauteries or escharotics, because they make the bone carious; and nerves, when thus hurt, sometimes produce violent symptoms.\u2014But we must remark, that often, instead of a hole, a notch only is to be seen: Nay, in some skulls, scarce a vestige even of this is left; in others, both hole and notch are observable, when the nerve and artery run separately. Frequently a hole is found on one side, and a notch on the other; at other times we see two holes; or there is a common hole without, and two distinct entries internally. Near the middle of the inside of each orbit, hard by, or in the transverse future, there is a small hole for the passage of the nasal twig of the first branch of the fifth pair of nerves, and of a branch of the ophthalmic artery.\u2014This hole is sometimes entirely formed in the os frontis; in other skulls, the sides of it are composed of this last bone, and of the os planum. It is commonly known by the name of orbitarium internum, though anterius should be added, because of the next, which is commonly omitted.\u2014This, which may be called orbitarium internum posterius, is such another as the former; only smaller, and about an inch deeper in the orbit: through it a small branch of the ocular artery passes to the nose.\u2014Besides these six, there are a great number of small holes observable on the outer surface of this bone, particularly in the two protuberances above the eye-brows. Most of these penetrate no further than the sinuses, or than the diploe, if the sinuses are wanting. The place, size, and number of them, are however uncertain: They generally serve for the transmission of small arteries or nerves.\n\nThe internal surface of the os frontis is concave, except at the orbital processes, which are convex, to support the anterior lobes of the brain. This surface is not so smooth as the external; for the larger branches of the arteries of the dura mater make some furrows in its sides and back-parts. The sinuosities from the luxuriant risings of the brain, mentioned when describing the general structure of the cranium, are often very observable on its upper part; and its lower and fore parts are marked with the contortions of the anterior lobes of the brain.\u2014Through the middle of this internal surface, where always in children, and sometimes in old people, the bone is divided, either a ridge stands out, to which the upper edge of the falx is fastened, or a furrow runs, in which the upper side of the superior longitudinal sinus is lodged; on both these accounts chirurgical authors justly discharge the application of the trepan here.\n\nImmediately at the root of this ridge or furrow there is a small hole, which sometimes pierces through the first table, and, in other skulls, opens into the superior sinus of the ethmoid bone within the nose. In it a little process of the falx is lodged, and a small artery, and sometimes a vein, runs; and the superior longitudinal sinus begins here.\u2014This hole, however, is often not entirely proper to the os frontis; for in several skulls, the lower part of it is formed in the upper part of the base of the crita galli, which is a process of the ethmoid bone.\n\nThe os frontis is composed of two tables, and an intermediate diploe, as the other bones of the cranium are, and in a middle degree of thickness between the os occipitis and the parietal bones.\n\nThe diploe is also exhausted in that part above the eye-brows, where the two tables of the bone separate, by the external being protruded outwards, to form two large cavities, called sinus frontales.\u2014These are divided by a middle perpendicular bony partition.\u2014In some skulls, besides the large perpendicular septum, there are several bony pillars, or short partitions, found in each sinus; in others these are wanting.\u2014For the most part, the septum is entire; at other times it is discontinued, and the two sinuses communicate.\u2014Each sinus commonly opens by a roundish small hole, at the inner and lower part of the internal angular processes, into a sinus formed in the nose, at the upper and back part of the os unguis; near to which there are also some other small sinuses of this bone, the greater part of which open separately nearer the septum narium, and often they terminate in the same common canal with the large ones.\n\nIn a natural and sound state, these cavities are of considerable advantage; for the organ of smelling being thus enlarged, the effluvia of odorous bodies more difficulty escape it; and their impressions being more numerous, are therefore stronger, and affect the organ more.\u2014These and the other cavities which open into the nose, increase the sound of our voice, and render it more melodious, by serving as so many vaults to resound the notes. Hence people labouring under a coryza, or stoppage of the nose from any other cause, when they are by the vulgar, though falsely, said to speak through their nose, have such a disagreeable harsh voice.\u2014The liquor separated in the membrane of these sinuses, drips down upon the membrane of the nose to keep it moist.\n\nFrom the description of these sinuses, it is evident how\nhow useless, nay, how pernicious it must be, to apply a trepan on this part of the skull; for this instrument, instead of piercing into the cavity of the cranium, would reach no further than the sinuses.\n\nThe upper circular part of the os frontis is joined to the os parietalia, from one temple to the other, by the coronal suture. From the termination of the coronal suture to the external angular processes, this bone is connected to the sphenoid by the sphenoidal suture. At the external canthi of the eyes, its angular processes are joined by the transverse suture to the os malarum, to which it adheres one third down the outside of the orbits; whence to the bottom of these cavities, and a little up on their internal sides, these orbital processes are connected to the sphenoidal bone by that same suture.\u2014On the inside of each orbit, the orbital process is indented between the cribriform part of the ethmoid bone, and the os planum and uncus.\u2014The transverse suture afterwards joins the frontal bone to the superior nasal processes of the os maxillaria superiors, and to the nasal bones. And, lastly, its nasal process is connected to the nasal lamella of the ethmoid bone.\n\nThe frontal bone serves to defend and support the anterior lobes of the brain. It forms a considerable part of the cavities that contain the globes of the eyes, helps to make up the septum narium, organ of smelling, &c. From the description of the several parts, the other uses of this bone are evident.\n\nIn a ripe child, the frontal bone is divided through the middle; the supraciliary holes are not formed; often a small round piece of each orbital process, behind the supraciliary ridge, is not ossified, and there is no sinus to be seen within its substance.\n\nEach of the two Osseae Parietaliae, or bones serving as walls to the encephalon, is an irregular square; its upper and fore sides being longer than the one behind or below. The inferior side is a concave arch; the middle part receiving the upper round part of the temporal bone.\u2014The angle formed by this upper side and the fore one, is so extended, as to have the appearance of a process.\n\nThe external surface of each os parietale is convex. Upon it, somewhat below the middle height of the bone, there is a transverse arched ridge, of a whiter colour generally than any other part of the bone; from which, in bones that have strong prints of muscles, we see a great many converging furrows, like so many radii drawn from a circumference towards a centre. From this ridge of each bone the temporal muscle rises; and, by the pressure of its fibres, occasions the furrows just now mentioned.\u2014Below these, we observe, near the semicircular edges, a great many risings and depressions, which are joined to like inequalities on the inside of the temporal bone, to form the squamous suture. The temporal bone may therefore serve here as a buttress, to prevent the lower side of the parietal from starting outwards when its upper part is pressed or struck.\n\nNear the upper fides of these bones, towards the hind part, is a small hole in each, through which a vein passes from the teguments of the head to the longitudinal sinus.\u2014In several skulls, one of the osseae parietaliae has not this hole; in others, there are two in one bone; and in some not one in either. Most frequently this hole is through both tables; at other times the external table is only perforated.\u2014The knowledge of the course of these vessels may be of use to surgeons, when they make any incision near this part of the head, lest, if the vessels are rashly cut near the hole, they shrink within the substance of the bone, and so cause an obstinate hemorrhage, which neither ligatures nor medicines can stop.\n\nOn the inner concave surface of the parietal bones, we see a great many deep furrows, disposed somewhat like the branches of trees: The furrows are largest and deepest at the lower edge of each os parietale, especially near its anterior angle, where sometimes a full canal is formed. They afterwards divide into small furrows, in their progress upwards.\u2014In some skulls a large furrow begins at the hole near the upper edge, and divides into branches, which join with those which come upwards, shewing the communications of the upper and lower vessels of the dura mater.\u2014In these furrows we frequently see passages into the diploe. On the inside of the upper edge of the osseae parietaliae, there is a large sinuosity, frequently larger in the bone of one side than of the other, where the upper part of the fulx is fattened, and the superior longitudinal sinus is lodged.\u2014Generally part of the lateral sinuses makes a depression near the angle, formed by the lower and posterior sides of these bones; and the pits made by the prominent parts of the brain are to be seen in no part of the skull more frequent, or more considerable, than in the internal surface of the parietal bones.\n\nThe osseae parietaliae are amongst the thinnest bones of the cranium; but enjoy the general structure of two tables and diploe the completest, and are the most equal and smooth.\n\nThese bones are joined at their fore-side to the os frontis by the coronal suture; at their long inferior angles, to the sphenoid bone, by part of the suture of this name; at their lower edge, to the os temporum, by the squamosus suture, and its posterior additamentum; behind, to the os occipitis, or osseae trigeminae, by the lambdoid suture; and above, to one another, by the sagittal suture.\n\nIn a child born at the full time, none of the sides of this bone are completed; and there never is a hole in the ossified part of it near to the sagittal suture.\n\nThe large unossified ligamentous part of the cranium observable between the parietal bones, and the middle of the divided os frontis of new-born children, called by the vulgar the open of the head, was imagined by the ancients to serve for the evacuation of the superfluous moisture of the brain; and therefore they named it bregma, or the fountain; sometimes adding the epithet pulsatile, or beating, on account of the pulsation of the brain felt through this flexible ligamento-cartilaginous substance. Hence very frequently the parietal bones are called osseae bregmatiae.\n\nAll the bregma is generally ossified before seven years of age. Several authors say, they have observed it unossified in adults; and physicians, who order the application of medicines at the meeting of the coronal and sagittal\ncal sutures, seem yet to think that a derivation of noxious humours from the encephalon is more easily procured at this part than any other of the skull; and that medicines have a greater effect here, than elsewhere, in the internal disorders of the head.\n\n**Ossa Temporum**, so named, say authors, from the hair's first becoming grey on the temples, and thus discovering peoples ages, are each of them equal and smooth above, with a very thin semicircular edge; which, from the manner of its connection with the neighbouring bones, is distinguished by the name of *os squamosum*. Behind this, the upper part of the temporal bone is thicker, and more unequal, and is sometimes described as a distinct part, under the name of *pars mammillaris*. Towards the base of the skull, the temporal bone appears very irregular and unequal; and this part, instead of being broad, and placed perpendicularly, as the others are, is contracted into an oblong very hard substance, extended horizontally forwards and inwards, which in its progress becomes smaller, and is commonly called *petrosum*.\n\nThree external processes of each temporal bone are generally described.\u2014The first, placed at the lower and hind-part of the bone, from its resemblance to a nipple, is called *mastoides*, or *mammillaris*. It is not solid, but within is composed of cancelli, or small cells, which have a communication with the large cavity of the ear, the drum; and therefore founds, being multiplied in this vaulted labyrinth, are increased, before they are applied to the immediate organ of hearing. Into the mastoid process, the stenomastoideus muscle is inserted; and to its back-part, where the surface is rough, the trachelo-mastoideus, and part of the splenius are fixed.\u2014About an inch farther forward, the second process begins to rise out from the bone; and having its origin continued obliquely downwards and forwards for some way, it becomes smaller, and is stretched forwards to join with the *os malae*; they together forming the bony jugum, under which the temporal muscle passes. Hence this process has been named *zygomaticus*. Its upper edge has the strong aponeurosis of the temporal muscle fixed into it; and its lower part gives rise to a share of the masseter.\u2014The fore-part of the base of this process is an oblong tubercle, which in a recent subject is covered with a smooth polished cartilage, continued from that which lines the cavity immediately behind this tubercle.\u2014From the under craggy part of the *os temporum*, the third process stands out obliquely forwards. The shape of it is generally said to resemble the ancient *stylus scribae*; and therefore it is called the *styloid* process. Several muscles have their origin from this process, and borrow one half of their name from it; as *stylo-glossus*, *stylo-hyoides*, *stylo-pharyngeus*: to it a ligament of the *os hyoides* is sometimes fixed; and another is extended from it to the inside of the angle of the lower jaw. This process is often, even in adults, not entirely ossified, but is ligamentous at its root, and sometimes is composed of two or three distinct pieces.\u2014Round the root of it, especially at the fore-part, there is a remarkable rising of the *os petrosum*, which some have effected a process; and, from the appearance it makes with the styloid form, have named it *vaginalis*.\u2014Others again have, under the name of *auditory process*, reckoned among the external processes that semicircular ridge, which, running between the root of the mastoid and zygomatic processes, forms the under part of the external meatus auditorius.\n\nThe sinuities or depressions on the external surface of each os temporum are these:\u2014A long fossa at the inner and back part of the root of the mammary process, where the posterior head of the digastric muscle has its origin.\u2014Immediately before the root of the zygomatic process, a considerable hollow is left, for lodging the crotaphite muscle.\u2014Between the zygomatic, auditory, and vaginal processes, a large cavity is formed; through the middle of which, from top to bottom, a fissure is observable, into which part of the ligament that secures the articulation of the lower jaw with this bone is fixed. The fore-part of the cavity being lined with the same cartilage which covers the tubercle before it, receives the condyle of the jaw; and in the back-part a small share of the parotid gland, and a cellular fatty substance, are lodged.\u2014At the inside of the root of the styloid apophysis, there is a thimble-like cavity, where the beginning of the internal jugular vein, or end of the lateral sinus, is lodged.\u2014Round the external meatus auditorius, several sinuities are formed for receiving the cartilages and ligaments of the ear, and for their firm adhesion.\n\nThe holes that commonly appear on the outside of each of these bones, and are proper to each of them, are five.\u2014The first, situated between the zygomatic and mastoid processes, is the orifice of a large funnel-like canal, which leads to the organ of hearing; therefore is called *meatus auditorius externus*.\u2014The second gives passage to the poria dura of the seventh pair of nerves; and, from its situation between the mastoid and styloid processes, is called *foramen stylo mastoideum*.\u2014Some way before, and to the inside of the styloid process, is the third hole; the canal from which runs first upwards, then forwards, and receives into it the internal carotid artery, and the beginning of the intercostal nerve; where this canal is about to make the turn forwards, one, or sometimes two very small holes go off towards the cavity of the ear called *tympanum*: through these Valsalva affirms the proper artery or arteries of that cavity are sent.\u2014On the anterior edge of this bone, near the former, a fourth hole is observable, being the orifice of a canal which runs outwards and backwards, in a horizontal direction, till it terminates in the tympanum. This, in the recent subject, is continued forward and inward, from the parts which were mentioned just now as its orifice in the skeleton, to the side of the nostrils: being partly cartilaginous, and partly ligamentous. The whole canal is named, *Iter a palato ad auren*, or Eustachian tube.\u2014On the external side of the bony part of this canal, and a-top of the chink in the cavity that receives the condyle of the lower jaw, is the course of the little nerve said commonly to be reflected from the lingual branch of the fifth pair, till it enters the tympanum, to run across this cavity, and to have the name of *chorda tympani*.\u2014The fifth hole is very uncertain, appearing sometimes behind the mastoid process; sometimes it is common to the temporal and occipital bones; and in several skulls there is\nis no such hole. The use of it, when found, is for the transmission of a vein from the external teguments to the lateral sinus. But, in some subjects, a branch of the occipital artery passes through this hole, to serve the back-part of the dura mater.\n\nThe internal surface of the os temporum is unequal; the upper circular edge of the squamous part having numerous small ridges and furrows for its conjunction with the parietal bones; and the rest of it is irregularly marked with the convolutions of the middle part of the brain, and with furrows made by the branches of the arteries of the dura mater.\n\nFrom the under part of this internal surface, a larger transverse, hard, craggy protuberance runs horizontally inwards and forwards, with a sharp edge above, and two flat sides, one facing obliquely forwards and outwards, and the other as much backwards and inwards. To the ridge between these two sides, the large lateral process of the dura mater is fixed.\n\nSometimes a small bone, akin to the sphenoid, is found between the small end of this petrous process and the sphenoid bone.\n\nTowards the back-part of the inside of the os temporum, a large deep fossa is conspicuous, where the lateral sinus lies; and frequently on the top of the petrous ridge, a furrow may be observed, where a small sinus is situated.\n\nThe internal proper foramina of each of these bones are, first, the internal meatus auditorius in the posterior plain side of the petrous process. This hole soon divides into two; one of which is the beginning of the aqueduct of Fallopian; the other ends in several very small canals, that allow a passage to the branches of the portio molis of the seventh pair of nerves, into the vestibule and cochlea. Through it also an artery is sent, to be distributed to the organ of hearing.\u2014The second hole, which is on the anterior plain side of the craggy process, gives passage to a reflected branch of the second branch of the fifth pair of nerves, which joins the portio dura of the auditory nerve, while it is in the aqueduct, small branches of blood-vessels accompanying the nerves, or passing through smaller holes near this one.\u2014The passage of the cutaneous vein into the lateral sinus, or of a branch of the occipital artery, is seen about the middle of the large fossa for that sinus; and the orifice of the canal of the carotid artery is evident at the under part of the point of the petrous process.\n\nThe upper round part of the squamous bones is thin, but equal; while the low petrous part is thick and strong, but irregular and unequal, having the dilution of tables and diploe confounded, with several cavities, processes, and bones within its substance, which are parts of the organ of hearing. See the description of the bones, muscles, &c. of the ear, in part VI.\n\nThe temporal bones are joined above to the parietal bones by the squamous sutures, and their posterior additamenta: Before, to the sphenoid bone by the future of that name; to the cheek-bones by the zygomatic sutures: Behind, to the occipital bone, by the lambdoid suture and its additamenta; and they are articulated with the lower jaw in the manner which shall be described when this bone is examined.\n\nOs Occipitis, so called from its situation, is convex on the outside, and concave internally. Its figure is an irregular square, or rather rhomboid; of which the angle above is generally a little rounded; the two lateral angles are more finished, but obtuse; and the lower one is stretched forward in form of a wedge, and thence is called by some the cuneiform process.\n\nThe external surface is convex, except at the cuneiform apophyse, where it is flattened. At the base of this triangular process, on each side of the great hole, but more advanced forwards than the middle of it, the large oblong protuberances, named the condyles, appear, to serve for the articulation of this bone with the first vertebra of the neck. The smooth surface of each of these condylar processes is longest from behind forwards, where, by their oblique situation, they come much nearer to each other than they are at their back-part. Their inner sides are lower than the external, by which they are prevented from sliding to either side out of the cavities of the first vertebra.\u2014Round their root a small depression and spongy roughness is observable, where the ligaments for surrounding and securing their articulations adhere.\u2014Though the motion of the head is performed on the condyles, yet the centre of gravity of that globe does not fall between them, but is a good way further forward; from which mechanism it is evident, that the muscles which pull the head back must be in a constant state of contraction; which is stronger than the natural contraction of the proper flexors, else the head would always fall forwards, as it does when a man is asleep, or labours under a palsy, as well as in infants, where the weight of the head far exceeds the proportional strength of these muscles.\n\nAll round the great foramen the edges are unequal, for the firmer adhesion of the strong circular ligament which goes thence to the first vertebra.\u2014One end of each lateral or moderator ligament of the head, is fixed to a rough surface at the fore-part of each condyle, and the perpendicular one is connected to a rough part of the edge of the great hole between the two condyles.\n\nOn the inner surface of the os occipitis we see two ridges; one standing perpendicular, the other running horizontally across the first. The upper part of the perpendicular limb of the cross, to which the falx is fixed, is hollowed in the middle, or often on one side, for the reception of the superior longitudinal sinus, and the lower part of it has the small or third process of the dura mater adherent to it, and is sometimes hollowed by the occipital sinus. Each side of the horizontal limb is made hollow by the lateral fissures inclosed in the transverse process of the dura mater; the fossa in the right side being generally a continuation of the one made by the longitudinal sinus in the perpendicular limb, and therefore is larger than the left one.\u2014Round the middle of the cross there are four large depressions separated by its limbs; the two upper ones being formed by the back-part of the brain, and the two lower ones by the cerebellum.\u2014Farther forward than the last mentioned depressions,\npressions, is the lower part of the fossa for the lateral sinus on each side. \u2014 The inner surface of the cuneiform apophysis is made concave for the reception of the medulla oblongata, and of the basilar artery. \u2014 A furrow is made on each side, near the edges of this process, by a sinus of the dura mater, which empties itself into the lateral sinus.\n\nThe holes of this bone are commonly five proper, and two common to it and to the temporal bones. \u2014 The first of the proper holes, called foramen magnum, from its size, is immediately behind the wedge-like process, and allows a passage to the medulla oblongata, nervi accessorii, to the vertebral arteries, and sometimes to the vertebral veins. \u2014 At each side of this great hole, near its fore-part, and immediately above the condyles, we always find a hole, sometimes two, which soon unite again into one that opens externally; through these the ninth pair of nerves go out of the skull. \u2014 The fourth and fifth holes pierce from behind the condyle of each side, into the fossae of the lateral sinuses; they serve for the passage of the cervical veins to these sinuses. Often one of these holes is wanting, sometimes both, when the veins pass through the great foramen. \u2014 Besides these five, we frequently meet with other holes near the edges of this bone, for the transmission of veins; but their number and diameter are very uncertain. The two common foramina are the large irregular holes, one in each side, between the sides of the cuneiform process, and the edges of the petrous bones. In a recent subject, a strong membrane runs across from one side to the other of each of these holes.\n\nThe occipital bone is among the thickest of the cranium, though unequally so; for it is stronger above, where it has no other defense than the common teguments, than it is below, where, being pressed by the lobes of the brain and cerebellum on one side, and, by the action of the muscles on the other, it is so very thin, as to be diaphanous in many skulls.\n\nThe occipital bone is joined above to the os parietalia and trigona when present, by the lamboid suture; \u2014 laterally to the temporal bones, by the additamenta of the lamboid suture; \u2014 below to the sphenoid bone, by the end of its cuneiform process, in the same way that epiphyses and their bones are joined. \u2014 The os occipitis is joined by a double articulation to the first vertebra of the neck, each condyle being received into a superior oblique process of that vertebra.\n\nOs Ethmoides, or the sieve-like bone, has got its name from the great number of small holes with which that part of it first taken notice of is pierced. When this bone is entire, the figure of it is not easily described; but, by a detail of its several parts, some idea may be afforded of the whole; and therefore we shall distinguish it into the cribriform lamella with its processes, the nasal lamella, cellulae, and os spongiosum.\n\nThe thin horizontal lamella, is all (except its back-part) pierced obliquely by a great number of small holes, through which the filaments of the olfactory nerves pass. \u2014 From the middle of the internal side of this plate, a thick process rises upwards, and, being highest at the fore-part, gradually becomes lower, as it is extended backwards. From some resemblance which this process was imagined to have to a cock's comb, it has been called cribrum galli. The falx is connected to its ridge, and to the unperforated part of the cribriform plate. \u2014 When the cribrum is broke, its base is sometimes found to be hollow, with its cavity opening into the nose.\n\nFrom the middle of the outer surface of the cribriform lamella, a thin fold plate is extended downwards and forwards, having the same common base with the cribrum galli. Generally it is not exactly perpendicular, but is inclined to one side or other, and therefore divides the cavity of the nose unequally. Its inclination to one side, and flexure in the middle, is sometimes so great, that it fills up a large share of one of the nostrils, and has been mistaken for a polypus there. \u2014 It is thin at its rife, and rather still thinner in its middle; yet afterwards, towards its lower edge, it becomes thicker, that its conjunction with the bones and middle cartilage of the nose might be firmer.\n\nAt a little distance from each side of this external process, a cellular and spongy bony substance depends from the cribriform plate. The number and figure of the cells in this irregular process of each side, are very uncertain; only the cells open into each other, and into the cavity of the nose: The uppermost, which are below the aperture of the frontal sinuses, are formed like funnels. \u2014 The outer surface of those cells is smooth and plain, where this bone assists in composing the orbit; at which place, on each side, it has got the name of os planum; on the upper edge of which, a small notch or two may sometimes be observed, which go to the formation of the internal orbital holes.\n\nBelow the cells of each side, a thin plate is extended inwards, and then bending down, it becomes thick, and of a spongy texture. \u2014 This spongy part is triangular, with a straight upper edge placed horizontally, an anterior one slanting from above, downwards and forwards, and with a pendulous convex one below. \u2014 The upper and lower edges terminate in a sharp point behind. \u2014 The side of this pendulous spongy part next to the septum narium is convex, and its external side is concave. \u2014 These two processes of the ethmoid bone have got the name of os spongiosum, or turbinate superiores, from their substance, figure, and situation.\n\nAll the prominencies, cavities and meanders of this ethmoid bone, are covered with a continuation of the membrane of the nostrils, in a recent subject. \u2014 Its horizontal cribriform plate is lodged between the orbital processes of the frontal bone, to which it is joined by the ethmoid suture, except at the back-part, where it is connected with the cuneiform bone, by a suture common to both these bones. \u2014 Where the os planum are contiguous to the frontal bone within the orbit, their conjunction is reckoned part of the transverse suture. \u2014 Farther forward than the os planum, the cells are covered by the os unguis, which are not only contiguous to these cells, but cannot be separated from them, without breaking the bony substance. \u2014 Below the os unguis and planum, these cells and os spongiosum are overlapped by the maxillary bones. \u2014 The cellular part of each palate-bone is contiguous to each os planum and cells backwards. \u2014 The\nLower edge of the nasal perpendicular plate is received into the furrow of the vomer.\u2014Its posterior edge is joined to the fore-part of the processus azygos of the sphenoid bone.\u2014Its upper edge joins the nasal process of the frontal and nasal bones, and its anterior one is connected to the middle cartilage of the nose.\n\nFrom all which the uses of this bone are evident, viz. to sustain the anterior lobes of the brain; to give passage to the olfactory nerves, and attachment to the falx; to enlarge the organ of smelling, by allowing the membrane of the nose a great extent; to straighten the passage of the air through the nose, by leaving only a narrow winding canal, on the sensible membranous sides of which the substances conveyed along with the air must strike, to form part of the orbit of the eyes and septum narium; while all its parts are so light as not to be in hazard of separating by their weight; and they are so thin, as to form a large surface, without occupying much space.\n\nOs Sphenoides, or wedge-like bone, so called because of its situation in the middle of the bones of the cranium and face, is of an irregular figure, and bears some faint resemblance to a bat with its wings extended.\n\nWhen we view the external surface of the os sphenoides, two or three remarkable processes from each side of it may be observed; which are all of them again subdivided.\u2014The first pair is the two large lateral processes or wings; the upper part of each of which is called the temporal process, because they join with the temporal bones in forming the temples, and the seat for some share of the crotaphite muscles. That part of the wings which juts out towards the inside, somewhat lower than the temporal apophyses, and is smooth and hollowed, where it makes up part of the orbit, is thence named orbital processes. Behind the edge separating these two processes, there is often a small groove, made by a branch of the superior maxillary nerve, in its passage to the temporal muscle. The lowest and back-part of each wing, which runs out sharp to meet the osse petroso, has been styled the spinous process; from near the point of which a sharp pointed process is frequently produced downwards, which some call bifidiform, that affords origin to the pterygoid muscles. From this styloid process a very small groove is extended along the edge of the bone to the hollow at the root of the internal plate of the following processes, which forms part of the Eustachian tube.\u2014The second pair of external processes of the cuneiform bone is the two which stand out almost perpendicular to the base of the skull. Each of them has two plates, and a middle fossa facing backwards, and are named pterygoid or aliform processes. The external plates are broadest, and the internal are longest. From each side of the external plates, the pterygoid muscles take their rise. At the root of each internal plate, a small hollow may be remarked, where the musculus pterygoideus internus, or circumflexus palati, rises, and some share of the cartilaginous end of the Eustachian tube rests; and, at the lower end of the same plate, is a hook-like rising or process, round which the tendon of the last named muscle plays, as on a pulley.\u2014To these another pair may be added, to wit, the little triangular thin process, which comes from each side of the body of the sphenoid bone, where the pterygoid processes are rising from it, and are extended over the lower part of the aperture of the sinus, as far as to join the ethmoid bone, while their body hangs down into the nares.\u2014Besides these pairs of processes, there is a sharp ridge which stands out from the middle of its base: Because it wants a fellow, it may be called processus azygos. The lower part of this process, where it is received into the vomer, is thick, and often not quite perpendicular, but inclining more to one side than the other. The fore-part of this process, where it joins the nasal plate of the os ethmoides, is thin and straight.\n\nThe depressions, sinuositites, and fossae, on the external surface of this sphenoid bone, may be reckoned up to a great number, viz. two on the temporal apophyses where the crotaphite muscles lodge.\u2014Two on the orbital processes, to make way for the globes of the eyes.\u2014Two between the temporal and spinous processes, for receiving the temporal bones.\u2014Two between the plates of the pterygoid processes, where the musculi pterygoidei interni and pterygoidei externi are placed.\u2014Two between the pterygoid and orbital processes, for forming the holes common to this and to the cheek and maxillary bones.\u2014Two on the lower ends of the aliform processes, which the palate-bones enter into.\u2014Two at the roots of the temporal and pterygoid processes, where the largest share of the external pterygoid muscles have their rise.\u2014Two at the sides of the processus azygos, for forming part of the nose, &c.\n\nWhat was described under the name of temporal and spinous processes on the outside of the skull, are likewise seen on its inside, where they are concave, for receiving part of the brain; and commonly three apophyses on the internal surface of the sphenoid bone are only mentioned.\u2014Two rising broad from the fore-part of its body, become smaller, as they are extended obliquely backwards.\u2014The third standing on a long transverse base, near the back-part of the body of this bone, rises nearly erect, and of an equal breadth, terminating often in a little knob on each side. The three are called clinoids, from some resemblance which they were thought to have to the supports of a bed.\u2014From the roots of the anterior clinoid processes, the bone is extended on each side outwards and forwards, till it ends in a sharp point, which may have the name of the transverse spinous processes.\u2014Between, but a little farther back than the two anterior clinoid processes, we see a protuberance considerably smaller than the posterior clinoid process, but of its shape.\u2014Another process from between the transverse processes, often forces itself forwards into the os ethmoides.\n\nWithin the skull, there are two sinuositites in the internal part of each wing of the sphenoid bone, for receiving the middle part of the brain.\u2014One between the transverse spinous processes, for lodging the part of the brain where the cura medulla oblongata are.\u2014Immediately before the third, or middle clinoid process, a single pit generally may be remarked, from which a fossa goes out on each side to the holes through which the optic nerves pass. The pit is formed by the conjoined optic nerves; and in the fossa these nerves are lodged, as\nthey run divided within the skull.\u2014Between that third protuberance and the posterior clinoid process, the larger pit for the glandula pituitaria may be remarked. This cavity, because of its resemblance to a Turkish saddle, is always described under the name of sella Turcica, or epiphysium.\u2014On the sides of the posterior clinoid process a fossa may be remarked, that stretches upwards, then is continued forwards along the sides of the sella Turcica, near to the anterior clinoid processes, where a pit on each side is made. These fossae point out the course of the two internal carotid arteries, after they have entered the skull.\n\nThe holes on each side of the os sphenoides are six proper, and three common.\u2014The first is the round one immediately below the anterior clinoid processes, for the passage of the optic nerve, and of the branch of the internal carotid artery that is sent to the eye.\u2014The second is the foramen lacerum, or large slit between the transverse spinous and orbital processes: Through it the third, fourth, the first branch of the fifth, and the greater share of the fifth pair of nerves, and an artery from the internal carotid, go into the orbit. Sometimes a small branch of the external carotid enters near its end, to be distributed to the dura mater, and a vein, some call it the venous duct, or Nuck's aqueduct, returns through it to the cavernous sinus.\u2014The third hole, situated a little below the one just now described, is called rotundum, from its shape. It allows passage to the second branch of the fifth pair of nerves, or superior maxillary nerve, into the bottom of the orbit.\u2014The fourth is the foramen ovale, about half an inch behind the round hole. Through it the third branch of the fifth pair, or inferior maxillary nerve, goes out; and sometimes a vein from the dura mater passes out here.\u2014Very near the point of the spinous process is the fifth hole of this bone: It is small and round, for a passage to the largest artery of the dura mater, which often is accompanied with a vein.\u2014The sixth proper hole cannot be well seen, till the cuneiform bone is separated from all the other bones of the cranium; for one end of it is hid by a small protuberance of the internal plate of the pterygoid process, and by the point of the processus petrosus of the temporal bone. Its canal is extended above the inner plate of the pterygoid process; and where it opens into the cavity of the nose, it is concealed by the thin luminous part of the palate-bone. Through it a considerable branch of the second branch of the fifth pair of nerves is reflected.\u2014Often in the middle of the sella Turcica, a small hole or two pierce as far as the cellular substance of the bone; and sometimes at the sides of this sella, one or more small holes penetrate into the sphenoidal sinuses.\n\nThe first of the common holes is that unequal fissure at the side of the sella Turcica, between the extreme point of the os petrosum and the spinous process of the cuneiform bone.\u2014The second common hole is the large discontinuation of the external side of the orbit, left between the orbital processes of the cuneiform bone, the os maxillare, male, and palati. In this large hole the fat for lubricating the globe of the eye and temporal muscle is lodged, and branches of the superior maxillary nerve, with small arteries from the carotid and veins, pass.\n\nThe third hole is formed between the base of this bone and the root of the orbital process of the palate-bone of each side. Through this a branch of the external carotid artery, and of the second branch of the fifth pair of nerves, are allowed a passage to the nostrils, and a returning vein accompanies them.\n\nUnder the sella Turcica, and some way farther forward, but within the substance of the sphenoid bone, are two sinuses, separated by a bony plate. Each of them is lined with a membrane, and opens into the upper and back part of each nostril by a round hole, which is at their upper fore-part. This hole is not formed only by the os sphenoides, which has an aperture near as large as any transverse section of the sinus, but also by the palate-bones which are applied to the fore-part of these sinuses, and close them up, that hole only excepted, which was already mentioned. Frequently the two sinuses are of unequal dimensions, and sometimes there is only one large cavity, with an opening into one nostril.\n\nAs this bone is extremely ragged and unequal, so its substance is of very different thickness, being in some places diaphanous; in others it is of a middle thickness, and its middle back-part surpasses the greatest share of the cranium in thickness.\n\nThe os sphenoides is joined, by its wings, to the parietal bones above, to the os frontis and osa malarum before, to the temporal bones behind;\u2014by the fore-part of its body and spinous processes, to the frontal and ethmoid bones;\u2014by its back-part, behind the two sinuses, to the occipital, where it looks like a bone with the epiphyses taken off;\u2014to the palate-bones, by the ends of the pterygoid processes, and still more by the fore-part of the internal plates of the pterygoid processes, and of the sinuses;\u2014to the maxillary bones, by the fore-part of the external pterygoid plates;\u2014to the vomer and nasal plate of the os ethmoides, by the processus azygos. All these conjunctions, except the last, which is a chondylesis, are said to be by the future proper to this bone; though it is at first sight evident, that several other fusions, as the transverse, ethmoidal, &c. are confounded with it.\n\nWe see now how this bone is joined to all the bones of the cranium, and to most of the upper jaw; and therefore obtained the name of the wedge-like bone.\n\nThe Face is the irregular pile of bones, composing the fore and under part of the head, which is divided into the upper and lower maxillae or jaws.\n\nThe superior maxilla is the common designation given to the upper immovable share of the face. The shape of the superior jaw cannot easily be expressed; nor is it necessary, provided the shape and situation of all the bones which compose it are described. It is bounded above by the transverse future, behind by the fore-part of the sphenoid bone, and below by the mouth.\n\nThe upper jaw consists of six bones on each side, of a thirteenth bone which has no fellow, placed in the middle, and of sixteen teeth. The thirteen bones are, two osa naso, two osa unguis, two osa malarum, two osa maxillaria, two osa palati, two osa spongea inferiora, and the vomer.\nThe osa nasi are placed at the upper part of the nose; \u2014the osa unguis are at the internal canthi of the orbits; \u2014osa malarum form the prominence of the cheeks; \u2014osa maxillaria form the side of the nose, with the whole lower and fore part of the upper jaw, and the greatest share of the roof of the mouth; \u2014osa palati are situated at the back-part of the palate, nostrils, and orbit; \u2014osa spongiosa are seen in the lower part of the pares; \u2014and the vomer helps to separate these two cavities.\n\nThe bones of the upper jaw are joined to the bones of the skull by the schindylefts and sutures already described as common to the cranium and face, and they are connected to each other by gomphosis and fifteen sutures.\n\nThe gomphosis only is where the teeth are fixed in their sockets, and the schindylefts is only where the edges of the vomer are joined to other bones.\n\nThe first is the anterior nasal, which is straight, and placed longitudinally in the middle fore-part of the nose.\n\nThe second and third are the lateral nasal, which are at each side of the nose, and almost parallel to the first suture.\n\nEach of the two lacrymal is almost semicircular, and is placed round the lacrymal groove.\n\nThe sixth and seventh are the internal orbital; each of which is extended obliquely from the middle of the lower side of an orbit to the edge of its base.\n\nThe two external orbitars are continued, each from the end of the internal orbital, to the under and fore-part of the cheek.\n\nThe tenth is the mylohyal, which reaches only from the lower part of the septum narium to between the two middle dentic incisors.\n\nThe longitudinal palate suture stretches from the middle of the foremost teeth through the middle of all the palate.\n\nThe transverse palate one runs across the palate, nearer the back than the fore-part of it.\n\nEach of the two palato-maxillary is at the back-part of the side of each nostril.\n\nThe fifteenth is the spinous, which is in the middle of the lower part of the nostrils. This may perhaps be rather thought a double schindylefts.\n\nThese sutures of the face have not such conspicuous indentations as those of the skull have.\n\nOsse Nasai, so named from their situation at the root of the nose, are each of an irregular oblong square figure, being broadest at their lower end, narrowest a little higher than their middle; and becoming somewhat larger at the top, where they are ragged and thickset, and have a curvature forwards, that their connection with the frontal bone might be stronger. \u2014These bones are convex externally, and thereby better resist any violence from without; and they are concave internally, for enlarging the cavity of the nose.\n\nThe lower edge of these bones is unequal, and is stretched outwards and backwards, to join the cartilages of the nostrils. \u2014Their anterior side is thick, especially above, and unequal, that their conjunction to each other might be stronger; and a small rising may be remarked on their inner edge, where they are sustained by the septum narium. \u2014Their posterior side, at its upper half, has externally a depression, where it is overlapped some way by the maxillary bones, while its lower half covers these bones: By which contrivance, they do not yield easily to pressure applied to their fore-part or sides.\n\nA small hole is frequently to be observed on their external surface, into which two, three, or four holes, which appear internally, terminate for the transmission of small veins; sometimes the holes go no further than the cancelli of the bones.\n\nThe nasal bones are firm and solid, with very few cells or cancelli in them.\n\nThey are joined above to the frontal bone, by the middle of the transverse suture; \u2014behind, to the maxillary bones, by the lateral nasal sutures; \u2014below, to the cartilages of the nose; \u2014before to one another, by the anterior nasal suture; \u2014internally, to the septum narium.\n\nThese bones serve to cover and defend the root of the nose.\n\nOsse Unguis, or Lacrymalia, are so named, because their figure and magnitude are something near to those of a nail of one's finger, and because the tears pass upon them into the nose.\n\nTheir external surface is composed of two smooth cavities and a middle ridge. \u2014The depression behind forms a small share of the orbit for the eye-ball to move on, and the one before is a deep perpendicular canal, or fossa, larger above than below, containing part of the lacrymal sac and duct. This is the part that ought to be pierced in the great operation for the fistula lacrymalis. \u2014This fossa of the bone is cribriform, or has a great number of small holes through it, that the filaments from the membrane which lines it, infusing themselves into these holes, might prevent a separation of the membrane, and secure the bone in its natural situation. \u2014The ridge between these two cavities of the os unguis, is the proper boundary of the orbit at its internal canthus; and beyond which surgeons should not proceed backwards in performing operations here. \u2014The internal or posterior surface of this bone consists of a furrow in the middle of two convexities.\n\nThe substance of the os unguis is as thin as paper, and very brittle; which is the reason that these bones are often wanting in skeletons, and need little force to pierce them in living subjects.\n\nEach of these bones is joined, above, to the frontal bone, by part of the transverse suture; \u2014behind, to the os planum of the ethmoid bone, by the same suture; \u2014before, and below, to the maxillary bone, by the lacrymal suture; \u2014internally, the osa unguis cover some of the sinus ethmoidales.\n\nThese unguiform bones compose the anterior internal parts of the orbits, lodge a share of the lacrymal sac and duct, and cover the ethmoid cells. \u2014Their situation and tender substance make a rash operator in danger of destroying a considerable share of the organ of smelling, when he is performing the operation of the fistula lacrymalis.\n\nOsse Malarum are the prominent square bones which form the cheek on each side. \u2014Before, their sur-\nface is convex and smooth; backward, it is unequal and concave, for lodging part of the crotaphyte muscles.\n\nThe four angles of each of these bones have been reckoned processes by some. \u2014 The one at the external canthus of the orbit, called the superior orbital process, is the longest and thickest. \u2014 The second terminates near the middle of the lower edge of the orbit in a sharp point, and is named the inferior orbital process. \u2014 The third, placed near the lower part of the cheek, and thence called maxillary, is the shortest, and nearest to a right angle. \u2014 The fourth, which is called zygomatic, because it is extended backwards to the zygoma of the temporal bone, ends in a point, and has one side straight, and the other slopping. \u2014 Between the two orbital angles there is a concave arch, which makes about a third of the external circumference of the orbit, from which a fifth process is extended backwards within the orbit, to form near one third of that cavity; and hence it may be called the internal orbital process. \u2014 From the lower edge of each of the osa malarum, which is between the maxillary and zygomatic processes, the masseter muscle takes its origin; and from the exterior part of the zygomatic process, the musculus dilator oris rises; in both which places the surface of the bone is rough.\n\nOn the external surface of each cheek bone, one or more small holes are commonly found, for the transmission of small nerves or blood-vessels from, and sometimes into the orbit. \u2014 On the internal surface are the holes for the passage of the nutritious vessels of these bones. \u2014 A notch on the outside of the internal orbital process of each of these bones affords to form the great slit common to this bone and to the sphenoid, maxillary, and palate-bones.\n\nThe substance of these bones is, in proportion to their bulk, thick, hard, and solid, with some cancelli.\n\nEach of the osa malarum is joined, by its superior and internal orbital processes, to the os frontis, and to the orbital process of the sphenoid bone, by the transverse suture. \u2014 By the edge between the internal and inferior orbital processes, to the maxillary bone, by the internal orbital suture. \u2014 By the side between the maxillary and inferior orbital process, again to the maxillary bone, by the external orbital suture. \u2014 By the zygomatic process, to the os temporum, by the zygomatic suture.\n\nOssa Maxillaria Superiora, are the largest bones, and constitute the far greater part of the upper jaw.\n\nThe processes of each os maxillare may be reckoned seven. \u2014 The first is the long nasal one at its upper and fore-part, which is broad below, and turns smaller, as it rises upwards, to make the side of the nose. \u2014 At the root of this, a transverse ridge may be observed within the nostrils, which supports the fore-part of the upper edge of the os spongiosum inferius. \u2014 The second is produced backwards and outwards, from the root of the nasal process, to form the lower side of the orbit; and therefore may be called orbital. \u2014 The edge of this orbital process, and the ridge of the nasal one, which is continued from it, make a considerable portion of the external circumference of the orbit. \u2014 From the proper orbital process, a very rough triangular surface is extended downwards and outwards, to be connected to the cheekbone; and therefore may be called the malar process, from the lowest protuberant part of which some share of the malleter muscle takes its rise. \u2014 Behind the orbital process, a large tuberosity or bulge of the bone appears, which is esteemed the fourth process. \u2014 On the internal part of this we often meet with a ridge, almost of the same height with that in the nasal process, which runs transversely, and is covered by a similar ridge of the palate-bone, on which the back-part of the upper edge of the os spongiosum inferius rests. \u2014 The convex back-part of this tuberosity is rough for the origin of part of the external pterygoid muscle, and more internally is scabrous, where the palate and sphenoid bones are joined to it. \u2014 That spongy protuberance at the lower circumference of this bone, where the sockets for the teeth are formed, is reckoned the fifth. \u2014 The sixth is the horizontal plate, which forms the greater part of the base of the nostrils, and roof of the mouth; its upper surface, which belongs to the nostrils, is very smooth, but the other below is arched and rough, for the stronger adhesion of the membrane of the mouth, which is stretched upon it, and in chewing, speaking, &c., might otherwise be liable to be separated. \u2014 The seventh rises like a spine from the inner edge of the last, and forms a small part of the partition of the nostrils.\n\nThe depressions in each maxillary bone are, 1. A sinusosity behind the orbital process, made by the temporal muscle. 2. A pit immediately before the same process, where the origin of the musculus elevator labiorum communis, and elevator labii superioris, with a branch of the fifth pair of nerves, are lodged securely. 3. The hollow arch of the palate. 4. The semicircular great notch, or entry to the lower part of the nostrils, betwixt the root of the nasal process and spine of the palate-plate. 5. Sockets for the teeth: The number of these sockets is uncertain. 6. The lacrymal fossa in the nasal process, which affords the os unguis to form a passage for the lacrymal duct. Immediately on the outside of this, there is a small depression, from which the inferior or lesser oblique muscle of the eye has its origin. 7. The canal on the upper part of the great tuberosity within the orbit, which is almost a complete hole; in this a branch of the superior maxillary nerve passes. Besides these, the superior surface of the great bulge is concave, to receive the under part of the eye. \u2014 Immediately above the transverse ridge in the nasal process, a small hollow is formed by the os spongiosum.\n\nThe holes of this bone are two proper and two common, which are always to be found, besides several others, whose magnitude, number, &c., are uncertain. \u2014 The first of the proper is the external orbital, immediately below the orbit, by which the infra-orbital branch of the second branch of the fifth pair of nerves, and a small artery, come out, after having passed in the canal, at the bottom of the orbit, described Numb. 7. of the depressions. \u2014 The second is the foramen incisivum, just behind the fore-teeth, which, at its under part, is one irregular hole common to both the maxillary bones when\nthey are joined; but, as it ascends, soon divides into two, three, or sometimes more holes; some of which open into each nostril. Through them small arteries and veins, and a twig of the second branch of the fifth pair of nerves pass, and make a communication between, or join the lining coats of the nose and mouth.\n\nThe first common hole is that which appears at the inner side of the back-part of the tuberosity and of the sockets of the teeth, and is formed by a fossa in this bone, and a corresponding one in the os palati: through it a nerve, which is a branch of the second branch of the fifth pair, runs to the palate.\u2014The other common hole is the great slit in the outside of the orbit described already, as the second common hole of the sphenoid bone.\n\nAll the body of the maxillary bone is hollow, and leaves a large sinus akin to the frontal and sphenoid, which is commonly, but unjustly, called antrum Highmorianum.\u2014At the bottom of this cavity, we may often observe some protuberances, in which the small points of the roots of the teeth are contained.\u2014This cavern and the sockets of the teeth are often divided by the interposition only of a very thin bony plate, which is liable to be eroded by acrid matter collected in the antrum, or to be broke in drawing a tooth. The symptoms of a collection of a matter here naturally lead us to the practice of pulling out the teeth, and piercing through this plate into the antrum, to procure an evacuation of the collected matter.\n\nThe maxillary sinuses have the same uses as the frontal and sphenoidal; and the situation of the sinuses is such, that the liquor drilling from them, from the cells of the ethmoid and palate-bones, and from the lacrymal ducts, may always moisten all the parts of the membrane of the nasus in the different situations which the head is in.\n\nThe substance of the os maxillaria is compact and firm, except at the inferior processes, in which the teeth are lodged, where it is very spongy.\n\nThe maxillary bones are joined above by the upper ends of their nasal processes to the os frontis, by the transverse future;\u2014at the sides of these processes, to the os unguic, by the lacrymal futures;\u2014to the nasal bones, by the lateral nasal futures;\u2014by their orbital processes, to the cheek-bones, by the external orbital futures;\u2014by the internal sides of the internal orbital processes, to the os plana, by part of the ethmoidal future;\u2014by the back-part of the tuberosities, to the palate bones, by the futurae palato-maxillares;\u2014by the posterior edges of their palatine lamellae, to the os palati, by the transverse palate-future;\u2014by their nasal spines, to the vomer, by the spinous future;\u2014by their sockets, to the teeth by gomphosis;\u2014by the internal edge of the palate-plate, to one another, by the longitudinal palate-future; on the upper and fore-part of which a furrow is left for receiving the cartilage which forms the partition of the nostrils;\u2014between the fore-part of the nostrils and mouth, to each other, by the mystacial future;\u2014sometimes they are connected to the os spongionia inferiore, by a plain concretion or union of substance.\n\nThese bones form the greater part of the nose and of the roof of the mouth, and a considerable share of the orbit. They contain fifteen teeth, give rise to muscles, transmission to nerves, &c., as mentioned in the description of their several parts.\n\nOsse Palati are commonly described as two small square bones, at the back-part of the palate or roof of the mouth, though they are of much greater extent, being continued up the back-part of the nostrils to the orbit. Each palate-bone may therefore be divided into four parts, the palate square bone, the pterygoid process, nasal lamella, and orbital process.\n\nThe square bone is unequally concave, for enlarging both the mouth and cavity of the nose. The upper part of its internal edge rises in a spine, after the same manner as the palate-plate of the maxillary bone does, to be joined with the vomer.\u2014Its anterior edge is unequally ragged, for its firmer connexion with the palate-process of the os maxillare.\u2014The internal edge is thicker than the rest, and of an equal surface, for its conjunction with its fellow of the other side.\u2014Behind, this bone is somewhat in form of a crescent, and thick, for the firm connection of the velum pendulum palati; the internal point being produced backwards, to afford origin to the palato-staphylinus, or azygos-muscle.\u2014This square bone is well distinguished from the pterygoid process by a perpendicular fossa, which, applied to such another in the maxillary bone, forms a passage for the palatine branch of the fifth pair of nerves; and by another small hole behind this, through which a twig of the same nerve passes.\n\nThe pterygoid process is somewhat triangular, having a broad base, and ending smaller above. The back-part of this process has three fossae formed in it; the two lateral receive the ends of the two plates of the sphenoid bone, that are commonly compared to a bat's wing; the middle fossa makes up a part of what is commonly called the fossa pterygoidea; the fore-side of this palatine pterygoid process is an irregular concave, where it receives the back-part of the great tuberosity of the maxillary bone.\u2014Frequently several small holes may be observed in this triangular process, particularly one near the middle of its base, which, a little above, communicates with the common and proper holes of this bone already taken notice of.\n\nThe nasal lamella of this bone is extremely thin and brittle, and rises upwards from the upper side of the external edge of the square bone, and from the narrow extremity of the pterygoid process; where it is so weak, and at the same time so firmly fixed to the maxillary bone, as to be very liable to be broken in separating the bones.\u2014From the part where the plate rises, it runs up broad on the inside of the tuberosity of the maxillary bone, to form a considerable share of the sides of the maxillary sinus, and to close up the space between the sphenoid and the great bulge of the maxillary bone, where there would otherwise be a large slit opening into the nostrils. From the middle internal side of this thin plate, a crofs ridge, placed on such another of the maxillary bone, is extended; on it the back-part of the os spongionum\nSpongiosum inferius rests.\u2014Along the outside of this plate, the perpendicular fossa made by the palate-nerve is observable.\n\nAt the upper part of this nasal plate, the palate-bone divides into two processes, which were already named orbitar\u2014between which and the body of the sphenoid bone, that hole is formed, which was mentioned as the last of the holes common to the sphenoid bone.\u2014Sometimes this hole is wholly formed in the os palati, by a crofs plate going from the one orbitar process to the other. A nerve, artery, and vein belonging to the nostrils, pass here.\u2014The anterior of the two orbitar processes is the largest, and has its fore-part contiguous to the back-part of the maxillary sinus, and its upper surface appears in the bottom of the orbit, behind the back-part of the os maxillare and planum.\u2014It has cells behind, resembling those of the ethmoid bone, to which it is contiguous; it is placed on the aperture of the sinus sphenoidalis, so as to leave only a round hole at its upper fore-part.\u2014The other part of the orbitar process is extended along the internal side of the upper back-part of the maxillary tuberosity, to the base of the sphenoid bone, between the root of the processus azygos and the pterygoid process.\n\nThe palate-bones are joined to the maxillary, by the fore-edge of the palate square-bone, by the transverse palate-future:\u2014By their thin nasal plates, and part of their orbitar processes, to the same bones, by the palato-maxillares futures:\u2014By their pterygoid processes, and back-part of the nasal plates, to the alae vesperilio-num, by the sphenoid future:\u2014By the transverse ridges of the nasal plates, to the os spongiosum inferiora, by contact; hence frequently there is an intimate union of the substance of these bones in old skulls:\u2014By the orbitar processes, to the os plana and cellula ethmoidex, by the ethmoid future:\u2014To the body of the sphenoid bone, by the sphenoid future:\u2014By the internal edge of the square-bones, to each other, by the longitudinal palate-future; and by their nasal spines, to the vomer, by the spinous future.\n\nThe palate-bones form part of the palate, nostrils, orbits, and fossa pterygoidea; and they cover part of the sinus maxillares, sphenoidales, and ethmoides.\n\nOssa Turbinata, or Spongiosa inferiora, resemble the superior osa spongiosa in shape and substance, but have their anterior and upper edges contiguous to the transverse ridges of the nasal processes of the maxillary and palate-bones.\u2014From their upper straight edge, two small processes stand out: the posterior, which is the broadest, descends to cover some of the antrum Highmo-rianum; the anterior rises up to join the os unguis, and to make part of the lacrimal duct.\n\nBelow the spongy bones already mentioned, there are sometimes two others, one in each nostril, which seem to be a production of the sides of the maxillary sinus turned downwards. When this third sort of spongy bones is found, the middle one of the three in each nostril is the largest, and the lowest is the smallest.\u2014Besides all these, there are often several other small bones standing out into the nostrils, that, from their shape, might also deserve the name of turbinata, but are uncertain in their bulk, situation, and number.\n\nThey are joined to the osa maxillaria, palati, and unguis, especially in old subjects.\n\nTheir use is, to straighten the nostrils, to afford a large surface for extending the organ of smelling, to cover part of the antra maxillaria, and to assist in forming the under part of the lacrymal ducts, the orifices of which into the nose are concealed by these bones.\n\nVomer, or bone resembling a ploughshare, is the thirteenth of the upper jaw, without a fellow, forming the lower and back-parts of the partition of the nose.\n\nThe figure of this bone is an irregular rhomboid.\u2014Its sides are flat and smooth.\u2014Its posterior edge appears in an oblique direction at the back-part of the nostrils.\u2014The upper one is firmly united to the base of the sphenoid bone, and to the nasal plate of the ethmoid; and, when it can be got separated, is hollow, for receiving the processus azygos of the sphenoid.\u2014The anterior edge has a long furrow in it, where the middle cartilage of the nose enters.\u2014The lower edge is firmly united to the nasal spines of the maxillary and palate-bones.\u2014These edges of this bone are much thicker than its middle, which is as thin as the finest paper.\n\nIts situation is not always perpendicular, but often inclined and bended to one side, as well as the nasal plate of the ethmoid-bone.\n\nThe vomer is convex at its upper part, and then is straight as it is extended downwards and forwards, where it is composed of two plates; the edges of which have a great number of small processes, disposed somewhat like the teeth of a saw, but more irregularly, and several of them are reflected back. Between these plates, a deep fossa is left, which, so far as the top of the curvature, is wide, and has strong sides, for receiving the processus azygos of the sphenoid-bone. Beyond the arch forwards, the fossa is narrower and shallower gradually to the point of the bone, receiving, for some way the nasal lamella ethmoidica, which is so closely united to the vomer, by the little processes piercing into its substance, as to prevent any separation. The middle cartilage of the nose fills up what remains of the fossa at its fore-part.\n\nThe posterior edge of the vomer, which appears above the back-part of the palate-bones, is broader above; but as it descends forwards, becomes thinner, though it is still solid and firm.\u2014The lower edge of this bone, which rests on the nasal spine of the palate and maxillary bones, has a little furrow on each side, of a small middle ridge, answering to the spines of the bones of different sides, and the interstice between them. This edge and the upper one meet in the pointed fore-end of this bone.\n\nThe body of the vomer has a smooth surface, and solid, but thin substance; and towards its sides, where it is thickest, some cancelli may be observed, when the bone is broken.\n\nIt is joined above to the sphenoid and ethmoid bones, and to the middle cartilage of the nose, by schindyloids;\u2014below, to the maxillary and palate-bones, by the spinous future.\nThe vomer divides the nostrils, enlarges the organ of smelling, by allowing place for expanding the membrane of the nose on its sides, and sustains the palate-plates of the maxillary and palate-bones.\n\nMaxilla Inferior, the lower jaw, consists only of one moveable bone, and fifteen teeth incased into it.\n\nThis bone, which is somewhat of the figure of the Greek letter \u03b7, is situated at the lower part of the face, so as its convex middle part is forwards, and its legs are stretched back. It is commonly divided into the chin, sides, and processes.\u2014The chin is the middle fore-part, the extent of which to each side is marked on the external surface by the holes observable there, and internally, by the beginning of an oblique ridge.\u2014Beyond these, the sides appear, and are continued till the bone, by bending upwards, begins to form the processes.\n\nOn the fore-part of the chin, a transverse ridge appears in the middle, on each side of which the musculi quadrati, or depressores labii inferioris, and the levatores labii inferioris, depress the bone: And below these prints, a small rising may be observed, where the depressores commence.\u2014On the back-part of the chin, sometimes three, always two, small protuberances appear in the middle. To the uppermost, when it is seen, the frenum of the tongue is connected. From the middle one, the musculi genioglossi rise; and from the lowest, the geniohyoidei have their origin.\n\nAt the lower and fore-part of the external surface of each side of the lower jaw, a small eminence may be observed, where the depressor labiorum communis rises. Near the upper edge of the side a ridge runs length-ways, to which the under part of the musculus buccinator is connected.\u2014Internally, towards the upper edge of each side, another ridge appears, from which the mylohyoidei have their origin, and to which the internal membrane of the gums adheres.\n\nIn the upper edge of both chin and sides are a great many deep pits or sockets, for receiving the roots of the teeth. The number and magnitude of these sockets are various, because of the different number, as well of the teeth themselves, as of their roots, in different people. These sockets in this lower jaw, as well as in the upper one, are less deep as old age comes on; when freed from the teeth by any means, they are sometime after filled up with an osseous net-work, which at last becomes entirely solid, and as smooth as any other part of the bone; so that in a great many old jaws, one cannot observe a vestige of the sockets: But then the jaw becomes less, and much narrower.\u2014Hence we may know why the chin and nose of edentulous people are much nearer than before the teeth were lost; while their lips either fall in towards the mouth, or stand prominent forwards.\u2014When new teeth are protruded, new sockets are formed.\n\nThe lower edge of the chin and sides is smooth and equal, and is commonly called the base of the lower jaw.\n\nThe ends of the base, where the jaw turns upwards, are called its angles; the external surface of each of which has several inequalities upon it, where the masticator muscle is inserted; as the internal surface also has, where the pterygoideus internus is inserted, and a ligament, extended from the styloid process of the temporal bone, is fixed.\n\nThe processes are two on each side.\u2014The anterior sharp thin coronoid ones have the crotaphyte muscles inserted into them.\u2014The posterior processes, or condyles, terminate in an oblong smooth head, supported by a cervix. The heads, whose greatest length is transverse, and whose convexity is turned forwards, are tipped with a cartilage, as the articulated parts of all other moved bones are.\u2014The fore-part of the root and neck of these condyloid processes are a little hollow and rough, where the external pterygoid muscles are inserted.\n\nThe holes of the lower jaw are two on each side; one at the root of the processes internally, where a large branch of the third branch of the fifth pair of nerves enters with an artery, and a vein returns. A small sharp process frequently juts out backwards from the edge at the fore-part of this hole, to which a ligament, extended from the temporal bone, is fixed, which saves the nerve and vessels from being too much pressed by the pterygoid muscles.\u2014From the lower side of this hole, either a small superficial canal or a furrow descends, where a branch of the nerve is lodged, in its way to the mylohyoideus muscle and sublingual gland.\u2014The other hole is external, at the confines of the chin, where branches of the nerve and vessels come out.\u2014The canal betwixt these two holes is formed in the middle of the substance of the bone, and is pierced by a great number of small holes by which the nerves and blood-vessels of the cancelli and teeth pass.\n\nThe lower jaw generally receives the roots of sixteen teeth into its sockets, by gonophosis; and its condyloid processes, covered with cartilage, are articulated with the temporal bones.\n\nThe Teeth are the hard white bodies placed in the sockets of both jaws. Their number is generally sixteen above, and as many below; though some people have more, others have fewer.\n\nThe broad thick part of each tooth which appears without the socket, is the base, or body.\u2014The smaller processes sunk into the maxilla, are the roots or fangs, which become gradually smaller towards the end fartherest from the base, or are nearly conical, by which the surface of their sides divides the pressure made on the bases, to prevent the soft parts, which are at the small points of the sockets, to be hurt by such pressure.\n\nWithout the gums the teeth are covered with no membrane, and they are said to have no proper periosteum within the sockets; but that is supplied by the reflected membrane of the gums; which, after a good injection, may be evidently seen in a young subject, with the vessels from it penetrating into the substance of the teeth; and it may be discovered in any tooth recently pulled, by macerating it in water. The adhesion of this membrane to these roots is strengthened by the small furrows observable on them.\n\nEach tooth is composed of its cortex, or enamel, and an internal bony substance. The cortex has no cavity or place for marrow; and is so solid and hard, that saws or files can with difficulty make impression on it. It is\nthickest upon the base, and gradually, as the roots turn smaller, becomes thinner. \u2014 The fibres of this enamel are all perpendicular to the internal substance, and are straight on the base, but at the sides are arched with a convex part towards the roots; which makes the teeth resist the compression of any hard body between the jaws, with less danger of breaking these fibres, than if they had been situated transversely. The spongy sockets in which the teeth are placed likewise serve better to prevent such an injury, than a more solid base would have done.\n\nThe bony part of the teeth has its fibres running straight, according to the length of the teeth. When it is exposed to the air, by the breaking or falling off of the hard cortex, it soon corrupts. And hence carious teeth are often all hollow within, when a very small hole appears only externally.\n\nThe teeth have canals formed in their middle, wherein their nerves and blood-vessels are lodged; which they certainly need, being constantly wafted by the attrition they are subjected to in mastication, and for their further growth, not only after they first appear, but even in adults; as is evident when a tooth is taken out: For then the opposite one becomes longer, and those on each side of the empty socket turn broader; so that when the jaws are brought together, it is scarce observable where the tooth is wanting.\n\nThe vessels are easily traced so long as they are in the large canal, but can scarcely be observed in their distribution from that to the substance of the teeth of adults. \u2014 This plentiful supply of vessels must expose the teeth to the same disorders that attack other vascular parts.\n\nEvery root of each tooth has such a distinct canal, with vessels and nerves in it. These canals in the teeth with more than one root, come nearer each other, as they approach the base of the tooth: and at last are only separated by very thin plates, which being generally incomplete, allow a communication of all the canals; and frequently one common cavity only appears within the base, in which a pulpy substance, composed of nerves and vessels, is lodged.\n\nThe entry of the canals for these vessels is a small hole placed a little to a side of the extreme point of each root; sometimes, especially in old people, this hole is entirely closed up, and consequently the nerves and blood-vessels are destroyed.\n\nThe teeth are seen for a considerable time in form of mucus contained in a membrane; afterwards a thin cortical plate, and some few osseous layers appear within the membrane, with a large cavity filled with mucus in the middle; and gradually this exterior shell turns thicker, the cavity decreases, the quantity of mucus is lessened, and this induration proceeds till all the body is formed; from which the roots are afterwards produced.\n\nIn young subjects, different stamens, or rudiments of teeth, are to be observed. Those next the gums hinder ordinarily the deeper-seated ones from making their way out, while these prevent the former from sending out roots, or from entering deep into the bony sockets of the jaws; by which they come to be less fixed.\n\nChildren are seldom born with teeth; but at two years of age they have twenty; and their number does not increase till they are about seven years old, when the teeth that first made their way through the gums are thrust out by others that have been formed deeper in the jaw, and some more of the teeth begin to discover themselves farther back in the mouth. About fourteen years of age, some more of the first crop are shed, and the number is increased. \u2014 This shedding of the teeth is of good use; for if the first had remained, they would have stood at a great distance one from another; because the teeth are too hard in their outer crust, to increase so fast as the jaws do. Whereas both the second layer, and the teeth that come out late, meeting, while they are soft, with a considerable resistance to their growth in length, from those situated upon them, necessarily come out broad, and fit to make that close guard to the mouth, which they now form.\n\nThe teeth are joined to the sockets by gomphosis, and the gums contribute to fix them there; as is evident by the teeth falling out when the gums are any way destroyed, or made too spongy; as in the scurvy or salivations: Whence some call this articulation with the syissarcolis.\n\nThe uses of the teeth are to masticate our aliment, and to assist us in the pronunciation of several letters.\n\nThough the teeth so far agree in their structure, yet, because of some things wherein they differ, they are generally divided into three classes, viz. incisors, canini, and molares.\n\nThe incisors, are the four fore-teeth in each jaw, receiving their name from their office of cutting our aliment; for which they are excellently adapted, being each formed into a sharp-cutting edge at their base, by their fore-side turning inwards there, while they are slopped down and hollowed behind; so that they have the form of wedges; and therefore their power of acting must be considerably increased.\n\nThe incisors of the upper jaw, especially the two middle ones, are broader and longer generally than those of the under jaw.\n\nCanini, from the resemblance to dogs tusks, are one on each side of the incisors in each jaw. \u2014 The two in the upper jaw are called eye-teeth, from the communication of nerves which is said to be betwixt them and the eyes. \u2014 The two in the lower jaw are named angular, or wike-teeth, because they support the angles of the mouth.\n\nThe canini are broader, longer, and stronger, than the incisors. \u2014 Their bases are formed into a sharp edge, as the incisors are; only that the edge rises into a point in the middle. \u2014 Each of them has generally but one long root, though sometimes they have two. The roots are crooked towards the end. \u2014 The canini of the upper jaw are larger, longer, and with more crooked roots, than those of the under jaw.\n\nThe dentes molares, or grinders, which have got their name because they grind our food, are generally five in each side of each jaw; in all twenty. Their bases are broader, more scabrous, and with a thinner cortical substance, than the other teeth. They have also more roots,\nroots, and as these roots generally divericate from each other, the partitions of the sockets between them bear a large share of the great pressure they suffer, and hinder it to act on their points.\n\nThe numerous roots of the dentic molares prevent their loosening by the lateral pressure they suffer in grinding; and as the sockets in the upper jaw are more spongy, and the teeth are more liable, by their situation, to fall out, the grinders there have more numerous and more separated roots than in the lower jaw.\n\nAccording to the division made of the skeleton, we should now proceed to the description of the trunk of the body. But must first consider a bone, which cannot well be said to belong to either the head or the trunk; nor is it immediately joined to any other, and therefore is very seldom preferred with skeletons.\n\nThe Os Hyoides, which is situated horizontally between the root of the tongue and the larynx. It is properly enough named hyoides, from the resemblance it bears to the Greek letter v, and may, for a clearer demonstration of its structure, be distinguished into its body, cornua, and appendices.\n\nThe body is the middle broad part, convex before, and hollow behind.\u2014The convex fore-part is divided into two, by a ridge, into the middle of which the mylo-hyoidei, and into the sides the stylo-hyoidei, muscles are inserted.\u2014Above the ridge, the bone is horizontal, but pitted in the middle by the insertion of the two genio-hyoidei muscles, and a little hollowed more laterally by the basihyoidi.\u2014Below the ridge, it is convex, but a little flatted in the middle by the sterno-hyoidei, and pitted more externally by the coraco-hyoidei.\u2014The concavity behind faces backwards and downwards to receive the thyroid cartilage, when the larynx and the os hyoides are pulled towards each other by the action of the sterno-hyoidei and hyothyroidei muscles; and to its upper edge, the ligamentous membranes of the epiglottis, tongue, and thyroid cartilage, are fixed.\n\nThe cornua of the os hyoides are stretched backwards from each side of its body, where often a small furrow points out the former separation.\u2014These cornua are not always straight, nor of equal length; their two plain surfaces stand obliquely slopping from above, outwards and downwards.\u2014Into the external, the cerato glossus is inserted above, and the thyro-hyoideus muscle below; and to the one behind, the ligamentous membrane of the tongue and larynx adheres. Each of the cornua becomes gradually smaller, as it is extended from the base; but ends in a round tubercle, from which a movable cartilage stands out, which is connected to the upper process of the cartilago thyroidea.\n\nWhere the body of the os hyoides joins on each side with its cornua, a small styloid process, called appendix, rises upwards and backwards, into which the musculi stylo-hyoidei alteri, and part of the hyo-glossi muscles are fixed.\n\nThe substance of the os hyoides is cellular, but covered with a firm external plate, which is of sufficient strength to bear the actions of so many muscles as are inserted into it.\n\nIt is not articulated with any bone of the body, except by means of the muscles and ligaments mentioned.\n\nThe use of the os hyoides, is to serve as a solid lever for the muscles to act with, in raising or depressing the tongue and larynx, or in enlarging and diminishing the capacity of the fauces.","sp":180,"ep":206},{"h":"ANATOMY","t":"i, The strong ligament of the patella.\u2014The back-part of it where the fat has been dissected away. l, The external depression. m, The internal one. n, The cut tibia.\n\nFig. 9.

Life Annuities.\n\nThe value of annuities for life is determined from observations made on the bills of mortality. Dr Halley, Mr Simpson, and Mons. de Moivre, are gentlemen of distinguished merit in calculations of this kind.\n\nDr Halley had recourse to the bills of mortality at Breslaw, the capital of Silesia, as a proper standard for the other parts of Europe, being a place pretty central, at a distance from the sea, and not much crowded with traffickers or foreigners. He pitches upon 1000 persons all born in one year, and observes how many of these were alive every year, from their birth to the extinction of the last, and consequently how many died each year, as in the first of the following tables; which is well adapted to Europe in general. But in the city of London, there is observed to be a greater disparity in the births and burials than in any other place, owing probably to the vast resort of people thither, in the way of commerce, from all parts of the known world.

And the practice of buying and selling annuities on lives, by rules founded on such principles, may be justly considered as a sort of lottery or chance-work, in which the parties concerned must often be deceived. But as estimates and computations of this kind are now become fashionable, we shall here give some brief account of such as appear most material.\n\nFrom the above tables the probability of the continuance or extinction of human life is estimated as follows.\n\n1. The probability that a person of a given age shall live a certain number of years, is measured by the proportion which the number of persons living at the proposed age has to the difference between the said number and the number of persons living at the given age.\n\nThus, if it be demanded, what chance a person of 40 years has to live seven years longer? from 445, the number of persons living at 40 years of age in Dr Halley's table, subtract 377, the number of persons living at 47 years of age, and the remainder 68, is the number of persons that died during these 7 years; and the probability or chance that the person in question shall live these 7 years is as 377 to 68, or nearly as 5\u00bd to 1. But, by Mr Simpson's table, the chance is something less than that of 4 to 1.\n\n2. If the year to which a person of a given age has an equal chance of arriving before he dies, be required, it may be found thus: Find half the number of persons living at the given age in the tables, and in the column of age you have the year required.\n\nThus, if the question be put with respect to a person of 30 years of age, the number of that age in Dr Halley's table is 531, the half whereof is 265, which is found in the table between 57 and 58 years; so that a person of 30 years has an equal chance of living between 27 and 28 years longer.\n\n3. By the tables, the premium of insurance upon lives may in some measure be regulated.\n\nThus, The chance that a person of 25 years has to live another year, is, by Dr Halley's table, as 80 to 1; but the chance that a person of 50 years has to live a year longer is only 30 to 1. And, consequently, the premium for insuring the former ought to be to the premium for insuring the latter for one year, as 30 to 80, or as 3 to 8.\n\nProb. I. To find the value of an annuity of \u00a31. for the life of a single person of any given age.\n\nMons. de Moivre, by observing the decrease of the probabilities of life, as exhibited in the table, composed an algebraic theorem or canon, for computing the value of an annuity for life; which canon I shall here lay down by way of\n\nRule. Find the complement of life; and, by the tables, find the value of \u00a31. annuity for the years denoted by the said complement; multiply this value by the amount\namount of \u00a31. for a year; and divide the product by the complement of life; then subtract the quotient from 1; divide the remainder by the interest of \u00a31. for a year; and this last quotient will be the value of the annuity sought, or, in other words, the number of years purchase the annuity is worth.\n\n**Examp.** What is the value of an annuity of \u00a31. for an age of 50 years, interest at 5 per cent.\n\n86  \n50 age given.  \n36 complement of life.\n\nBy the Tables, the value is, 16.5468\n\nAmount of \u00a31. for a year,  \n1.05\n\n827340  \n165468\n\nComplement of life, 36|17.374140(.482615)\n\nFrom unity, viz. 1.000000  \nSubtract .482615\n\nInterest of \u00a31.

But yet those who sell annuities have generally one and a half or two years more value, than specified in the table, from purchasers whose age is 20 years or upwards.\n\nAnnuities of this sort are commonly bought or sold at so many years purchase; and the value assigned in the table may be so reckoned. Thus the value of an annuity...\nof one pound for an age of 50 years, at 3 per cent. interest, is 12.51; that is, 12 l. 10 s. or twelve and a half years purchase. The marginal figures on the left of the column of age serve to shorten the table, and signify, that the value of an annuity for the age denoted by them, is the same with the value of an annuity for the age denoted by the numbers before which they stand. Thus the value of an annuity for the age of 9 and 10 years is the same; and the value of an annuity for the age of 6 and 14, for the age of 3 and 24, &c., is the same. The further use of the table will appear in the questions and problems following.\n\n**QUEST. 1.** A person of 50 years would purchase an annuity for life of 200 l.: What ready money ought he to pay, reckoning interest at 4\u00bd per cent.? \n\nL,\n\nBy the table the value of 1 l. is 10.8\n\nMultiply by 200\n\nValue to be paid in ready money 2164.00 Ans.\n\n**QUEST. 2.** A young merchant marries a widow lady of 40 years of age, with a jointure of 300 l. a-year, and wants to dispose of the jointure for ready money: What sum ought he to receive, reckoning interest at 3\u00bd per cent.? \n\nL,\n\nBy the table the value of 1 l. is 12.98\n\n300\n\nValue to be received in ready money 4194.00 Ans.\n\n**PROB. 2.** To find the value of an annuity for the joint continuance of two lives, one life failing, the annuity to cease.\n\nHere there are two cases, according as the ages of the two persons are equal or unequal.\n\n1.

From thence it runs obliquely toward the head of the first phalanx of the thumb, and is inserted in the lateral external part of that bone, or on that side which is turned to the first metacarpal bone. It crosses over the semi-interosseus indicis, this muscle lying toward the back of the hand, and the antithenar toward the palm.\n\nPERFORATUS vulgo SUBLIMIS.\n\nThis is a muscle of a considerable volume, lying along the inside of the fore-arm, fleshy for the greatest part near the articulation of the fore-arm with the os humeri, and near the carpus, terminating in four distinct portions, which become the same number of long small tendons. The name of sublimis has been given to it, because it lies almost on the surface of the fore-arm; and that of perforatus, from the slits found near the extremities of its tendons.\n\nIt is commonly made up of four muscles, closely united by their fleshy portions. It is fixed above to the superior internal parts of the ulna and radius, and to that of the interosseus ligament. A little below the middle of the fore-arm, this large fleshy body is divided into four distinct muscles, which, on the lowest quarter of the fore-arm, end in four flat tendons of different sizes.\n\nThese four tendons are inclosed in a common membranous or mucilaginous vagina, which likewise furnishes each tendon with a particular thin vagina. In this manner they advance to the carpus, and pass under the large annular transverse ligament. Beyond this ligament, they spread again in the palm of the hand, still retaining their particular vaginae, and run between the aponeurosis palmaris and metacarpus, toward the fingers, separating more and more by degrees.\n\nHaving reached the heads of the metacarpal bones, they pass under the four arches or frenae formed by the surce of the aponeurosis palmaris, and particular septa of the great transverse ligament of the palm of the hand; and then each tendon having got beyond the head of one metacarpal bone, and beyond the basis of the first phalanx, enters the ligamentary vagina on the flat or inner side of that phalanx, and is inserted in the flat side of the second phalanx, near its basis, the membranous vagina accompanying it to its insertion.\n\nIn passing along the inside of the first phalanx, the tendon is divided by a long slit, which gives passage to a tendon of the perforans; and from thence the names of these two muscles are taken.\n\nPERFORANS vulgo PROFUNDUS.\n\nThis muscle is very like the former, and is situated much in the same manner; only it lies lower, and is covered by the perforatus. It is composed of four muscles, which at first seem to make but one mass, and afterwards terminate in four tendons.\n\nThe fleshy portions of the first and largest, and also of the second, are fixed in the superior parts of the ulna and interosseus ligament, down to their middle; the fleshy portion of the third is joined to the tendon of the ulnaris internus, by a sort of common aponeurosis; and that of the fourth is fixed along the ulna.\n\nThe four tendons have often several small collateral tendons, sometimes five in number, united to the tendons of the neighbouring muscle, as they pass under the large annular ligament of the carpus; but the tendons themselves are separated from the others by thin septa, which form a kind of particular rings. Being thus strengthened, they separate; and running along the palm of the hand in distinct membranous vaginae, like those of the perforatus, by which they are covered, they enter the ligamentary vaginae of the first phalanges together with the former; and having passed through the fissures thereof, and through the ligamentary vaginae of the second phalanges, they are inserted in the flat inner side of the third, near their bases.","sp":242,"ep":243},{"h":"ANTITHENAR","t":"This is a small compound muscle, lying obliquely under the metatarsal bones.\nIt is fixed posteriorly in the lower parts of the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones, near their bases; in the ligament belonging to the first and second of these bones; in the neighbouring ligaments belonging to the bones of the tarus; and, lastly, in a lateral aponeurosis of the muscle commonly called hypotenar.\n\nAll these portions, contracting into a small compass, are inserted in the outside of the external sesamoid bone, and of the first phalanx of the great toe.","sp":252,"ep":253},{"h":"ANTITHENAR","t":"in anatomy, a name given to the adductor indicis.

The mouth is furnished with two jaws, and a proboscis infolded in a double sheath; the wings are four in number, the two foremost covering those behind when at rest: In the anus or tail of the females and working bees, which are of no sex, there is a hidden sting. Linnaeus enumerates no less than 55 species of the apis, viz. 1. The longicornis, or hairy yellow bee, with thread-like feelers, about the length of its body. 2. The tumulorum, or black bee, with yellow feet and jaws, and thread-like feelers, about the length of the body. 3. The clavicornis, or black bee, with clavated feelers, about the length of its body, and two yellow belts round the belly. 4. The centuncularis, or black bee, having its belly covered with yellow down. The nests of this species are made of rose-leaves curiously plaited in the form of a matt or quilt. 5. The cineraria, or black bee, with a white hairy breast, and a greenish belt round the belly. The above five species are all natives of Europe. 6. The mexicana, is a brownish bee, with bluish wings, and very large. It is a native of America. 7. The carbonaria, or reddish bee, with darkish green wings; it is about the size of the mellefica, or common honey-bee, and is found in Africa. 8. The retula, or black bee, has its legs covered with down. 9. The rufa, or brownish bee, with a white front and dusky belly. 10. The bicornis, has two horns on its front, a black head, and a hairy belly. 11. The maxillofa, or black bee, with prominent jaws, short feelers, and a cylindrical belly, covered with a yellow down. 12. The truncorum, or black smooth bee, with a white hairy front, and a yellow belly edged with white. 13. The florifomnis, or black bee, with a cylindrical incurved belly, having two tooth-like protuberances at the anus, and a kind of prickle on the hind-legs. This bee sleeps in flowers. 14. The dentata, or shining green bee, with black wings, and a kind of teeth on the hind thighs. The tongue of this bee is almost as long as its body. The nine last species are all natives of Europe. 15. The cordata, or shining green bee, with a belly shaped like a heart, and wings of a glass-colour. It is a native of the Indies. 16. The helvola, is an oblong reddish bee, with a white belly. 17. The fabriciana, or black bee, with an iron-coloured belly, and two yellow spots. 18. The succincta, has a yellow hairy breast, a black belly, and four white belts. The last three are natives of Europe. 19. The zonata, is brownish and hairy, with four bluish belts on the belly. It is a native of the Indies. 20. The \u00e6nea, is hairy, and of a copper colour. 21. The caruleceps, is brownish and hairy, with a greenish belly, margined with white indentations. 22. The mellefica, or honey-bee, is furnished with downy hairs, a dusky-coloured breast, and brownish belly; the tibiae of the hind-legs are ciliated, and tranversely streaked on the inside. Each foot of this bee terminates in two hooks, with their points opposite to each other; in the middle of these hooks there is a little thin appendix, which, when unfolded, enables the bees to fasten themselves to glass or most polished bodies. This part they likewise employ for collecting the small particles of wax which they find upon flowers, and for transmitting them to the middlemost joint of the two hinder feet, in which there is a little cavity, in the shape of a narrow spoon, surrounded by a number of hairs. When they have loaded their thighs with wax, they immediately carry it off to the hive...\nThe queen and drones, who never collect wax in this manner, have no such cavity. The belly of the bee is divided into six rings or joints. In the inside of the belly there is a small bladder or reservoir, in which the honey is collected, after having passed through the proboscis and a narrow pipe which runs through the head and breast. This bladder, when full of honey, is about the size of a small pea. The sting is situated at the extremity of the belly; it is a horny substance, and hollow within, for transmitting the venomous liquor, which lies in a bladder near the anus, into the wound. The sting is generally left in the wound, and frequently draws after it the poison-bag.\n\nAs the melissica, or honey-bee, is both an useful insect, and endowed with peculiar instincts, we shall give a particular account of its nature and economy.\n\nThe queen is the only female in a hive; she is distinguished from the others by being taller, more of an oblong figure, and having ten joints in each feeler. She is likewise furnished with a sting. The fuci, males, or drones, are commonly about 1600 in a hive; they have no sting, and their feelers have eleven joints. The operaria, spadones, or working bees, are sometimes 20,000 in a hive; they have fifteen joints in their feelers, and are armed with stings.\n\nAfter a new swarm is formed, the bees immediately begin to form their cells. They begin their work at the upper part of the hive, and continue it downwards, and from one side to the other. It is not easy to discover the particular manner of their working; for, notwithstanding the many contrivances used for this purpose, there are such numbers in continual motion, and succeed one another with such rapidity, that nothing but confusion appears to the sight. Some of them however have been observed carrying pieces of wax in their talons, and running to the places where they are at work, upon the combs. These they fasten to the work by means of the same talons. Each bee is employed but a very short time in this way; but there is so great a number of them that go on in a constant succession, that the comb increases very perceptibly. Besides these, there are others that run about beating the work with their wings and the hinder part of their body, probably with a view to make it more firm and solid.\n\nThe order they observe in the construction of their cells is this: They begin with laying the basis, which is composed of three rhombus's or lozenges. They build first one of the rhombus's, and draw faces on two of its sides; they then add a second rhombus to the first in a certain inclination, and draw two new faces on its two sides; and, last of all, they add a third rhombus to the two first, and raise on the two external sides of this rhombus two other faces; which completes the cell of an hexagonal figure.\n\nWhilst part of the bees are occupied in forming the cells, others are employed in perfecting and polishing those that are new-modelled. This operation is performed by their talons, taking off every thing that is rough and uneven. These polishers are not so deftly in their operations as those that make the cells; they work long and diligently, never intermitting their labour, excepting to carry out of the cell the particles of wax which they take off in polishing. These particles are not allowed to be lost; others are ready to receive them from the polishers, and to employ them in some other part of the work.\n\nEach comb has two rows of cells opposite to each other, which have their common bases. The thickness of every comb is something less than an inch, and the depth of the cells is about five lines. Almost all the combs are built with cells of this size; except a small number of a larger kind, that are destined for the worms that produce drones.\n\nThe bases of all the combs are placed at such a distance from one another, that, when the cells are finished, there is only a space left sufficient for the passage of two bees abreast. These combs are not continued from top to bottom, but are often interrupted, and have openings from one passage to another, which give a more easy and shorter communication.\n\nThe queen-bee is generally concealed in the most secret part of the hive, and is never visible but when she lays her eggs in such combs as are exposed to sight. When she does appear, she is always attended by ten or a dozen of the common sort, who form a kind of retinue, and follow her wherever she goes with a sedate and grave tread. Before she lays her eggs, she examines the cells where she designs to lay them; and if she finds that they contain neither honey, wax, nor any embryo, she introduces the posterior part of her body into a cell, and fixes to the bottom of it a small white egg, which is composed of a thin white membrane, full of a whitish liquor. In this manner she goes on, till she fills as many cells as she has eggs to lay, which are generally many thousands. After the eggs lie four days in the cells, they appear in the form of small caterpillars; and generally lie twisted round, so that the two extremities touch each other. The bees then supply them with a little honey for food, the quantity of which they increase till the eighth day from the birth of the caterpillar. After this, the bees discover no more care about their young; but stop up the mouths of the cells with wax. The embryos lie in this state twelve days, during which time they undergo surprising changes. They first change their situation in the cells, and instead of being rolled up, they extend themselves along, and place their heads towards the mouth of the cell; after this, the head of the worm begins to have a small extension, which is the rudiment of the proboscis: Upon the head there is likewise a black point, and at a little distance from this point, a black streak upon the back: The first lineaments of the feet likewise appear; but they are very small. After the head is formed, and the proboscis lengthened, all the other parts display themselves successively; so that the whole worm or embryo is changed into an aurelia or nymph, which is the fly almost perfect, except that it is yet white and soft, and wants that crust with which it is afterwards covered. By this transformation the worm is stripped of a white thin pellicle, which adheres to the sides of the cell. The young bee being stripped of this pellicle, and all the parts being unfolded by degrees, and changed through successive colours from yellow to black, arrives\nat perfection on the twentieth day; when she cuts, with her jaws or talons, the covering of wax upon the mouth of the cells, and issues out. When the young bees first get out of the cell, they appear drowsy, but soon acquire agility and command of their members; for they have often been observed to go to the fields, and return loaded with wax the same day that they issued from the cells.\n\nAs soon as a young bee quits its cell, one of the old ones takes off the wax-cover, and kneads and employs the wax for some other purpose: Another of them repairs and cleanses the cell, removing the pellicle and other forges which was left by the young one.\n\nIt was observed above, that bees collect their wax from the pollen or farina of flowers, and carry it to the hive. When they arrive there, they support themselves on their two fore-feet, and make a buzz with their wings, thereby warning the bees within to assist them to unload; which they instantly do, each taking a small portion of the wax from the hinder-legs of the loaded ones, till the whole be exhausted. The wax is not only employed for the original construction of the combs and cells, but is collected and laid up in considerable quantities for the purposes of repairing any damage that may happen to the works during the winter, when they have no opportunity of collecting it in the fields, and likewise to stop up the mouths of the cells when full of honey or embryos. Bees have often been observed to dilute their wax, when too hard, by means of some liquor or saliva which they emit upon it, in order to render it soft and pliable for use.\n\nThe honey, as well as the wax, is collected from flowers. The honey, however, is extracted from a different part of the flower. In the flowers of many plants there are nectaria, or nectariferous glands, which secrete from the plant a pure transparent liquor, resembling virgin-honey both in taste and appearance, excepting that it is thinner. Perhaps all the change that this nectariferous juice undergoes, by being sucked up, and deposited in the honey-bag of the bee, is, that the more watery parts may probably be absorbed during the small time it remains there. The heat of the hive, after it is deposited in the cells, will still evaporate more of the watery parts, and bring it to the consistence of honey.\n\nWhen a bee is collecting honey, she no sooner lights upon a flower than she extends her proboscis, and sucks up what she can find: If she cannot find a sufficient quantity to fill her bag in one flower, she immediately flies to another, and thus goes on till she has filled it. She then retires to the hive, goes to the cell, disgorges the honey, and again returns to the fields in quest of more. As the quantity carried home by one bee is but small, it requires the labour of many to fill a cell with honey. When the cells are full, they are immediately closed up with wax, if designed for winter-provision; if not, they are allowed to remain open for the common nourishment of the swarm.\n\nBesides these capital instincts of bees, they are possessed of others, some of which are equally necessary for their preservation and happiness. They anxiously provide against the entrance of insects into the hive, by gluing up with wax the smallest holes in the skep. Some stand as sentinels at the mouth of the hive, to prevent insects of any kind from getting in. But if a snail, or other large insect, should get in, notwithstanding all resistance, they sting it to death, and then cover it over with a coat of wax, to prevent the bad smell or maggots which might proceed from the putrefaction of such a large animal. Bees are seldom overtaken with bad weather; they seem to be warned of its appearance by some particular feeling. Cold is a great enemy to them. To defend themselves against its effects during a cold winter, they crowd together in the middle of the hive, and buzz about, and thereby excite a warmth which is often perceptible by laying the hand upon the glass-windows of the hive. They seem to understand one another by the motions of their wings. When the queen wants to quit the hive, she gives a little buzz, and all the others immediately follow her example, and retire along with her. They expel the drones before the winter, so that, of several hundreds in a hive, not one can be seen after the month of October. This expulsion always occasions a furious battle between the drones and the working bees; but the latter being greatly superior in number, always prevail.\n\nWith regard to Hives, those made of straw are the best, on many accounts: They are not liable to be overheated by the rays of the sun; they keep out cold better than wood or any other materials; and the cheapness renders the purchase of them easy. As the ingenious Mr Wildman's hives are reckoned to be of a preferable construction to any other, we shall give an account of them in his own words.\n\n\"My hives,\" says he, \"are seven inches in height, and ten in width. The sides are upright, so that the top and bottom are of the same diameter. A hive holds nearly a peck. In the upper row of straw, there is a hoop of about half an inch in breadth, to which are nailed five bars of deals, full a quarter of an inch in thickness, and an inch and quarter wide, and half an inch asunder from one another; a narrow short bar is nailed at each side, half an inch distant from the bars next them, in order to fill up the remaining parts of the circle; so that there are in all seven bars of deal, to which the bees fix their combs. The space of half an inch between the bars allows a sufficient and easy passage for the bees from one hive to another. In order to give great steadiness to the combs, so that, upon moving the hive, the combs may not fall off, or incline out of their direction, a stick should be run through the middle of the hive, in a direction directly across the bars, or at right angles with them. When the hives are made, a piece of wood should be worked into the lower row of straw, long enough to allow a door for the bees, of four inches in length, and half an inch in height.\n\nThe proprietor of the bees should provide himself with several flat covers of straw, worked of the same thickness as the hives, and a foot in diameter, that so it may be of the same width as the outside of the hives. Before the cover is applied to the hive, a piece of clean paper, of the size of the top of the hive, should be laid over it, and a coat of cow-dung, which is the\nleast apt to crack or any cement easily to be obtained, should be laid all round the circumference of the hive.\n\nLet the cover be laid upon this, and made fast to the hive with a packing-needle and pack-thread, so that neither cold nor vermin may enter.\n\nEach hive should stand single on a piece of deal, or other wood, somewhat larger than the bottom of the hive: That part of the stand which is at the mouth of the hive should project some inches, for the bees to rest on when they return from the field. This stand should be supported upon a single post, two and a half feet high; to which it should be screwed very securely, that high winds, or other accidents, may not blow down both stand and hive. A quantity of foot mixed with barley-chaff should be strewed on the ground round the post, which will effectually prevent ants, slugs, and other vermin, from rising up to the hive. The foot and chaff should, from time to time, be renewed as it is blown or washed away: Though, as it is sheltered by the stand, it remains a considerable time, especially if care be taken that no weeds rise through it. Weeds, indeed, should not be permitted to rise near the hive, for they may give shelter to vermin which may be harmful to the bees.\n\nThe stands for bees should be four yards asunder; or, if the apiary will not admit of so much, as far asunder as may be, that the bees of one hive may not interfere with those of another hive, as is sometimes the case, when the hives are near one another, or on the same stand: For the bees, mistaking their own hives, light sometimes at the wrong door, and a fray ensues, in which one or more may lose their lives.\n\nThe person who intends to erect an apiary, should purchase a proper number of hives at the latter part of the year, when they are cheapest. The hives should be full of combs, and well stored with bees. The purchaser should examine the combs, in order to know the age of the hives. The combs of that season are white, those of the former year are of a darkish yellow; and where the combs are black, the hives should be rejected, because old hives are most liable to vermin and other accidents.\n\nIf the number of hives wanted were not purchased in the autumn, it will be necessary to remedy this neglect after the severity of the cold is past in the spring. At this season, bees which are in good condition will get into the fields early in the morning, return loaded, enter boldly, and do not come out of the hive in bad weather; for when they do, this indicates they are in great want of provisions. They are alert on the least disturbance, and by the loudness of their humming we judge of their strength. They preserve their hives free from all filth, and are ready to defend it against every enemy that approaches.\n\nThe summer is an improper time for buying bees, because the heat of the weather softens the wax; and thereby renders the combs liable to break, if they are not very well secured. The honey too being then thinner than at other times, is more apt to run out of the cells; which is attended with a double disadvantage, namely, the loss of the honey, and the daub-\n\ning of the bees, whereby many of them may be destroyed. A first and strong swarm may indeed be purchased; and, if leave can be obtained, permitted to stand in the same garden till the autumn; but if leave is not obtained, it may be carried away in the night after it has been hived.\n\nI suppose, that in the stocks purchased, the bees are in hives of the old construction. The only direction here necessary is, that the first swarm from these stocks should be put into one of my hives; and that another of my hives should in a few days be put under the old stock, in order to prevent its swarming again.\n\nBees never swarm till the hive be too much crowded by the young brood. It is this circumstance that induces a part of the hive to think of finding a more commodious habitation. With this view they single out a queen from among the young, with whom they take wing; and where-ever she leads, the rest follow. They first begin to swarm in May, or in the end of April, but earlier or later according to the warmth of the season. They seldom swarm before ten in the morning, and seldom later than three in the afternoon. We may know when they are about to swarm, by clutters of them hanging on the outside of the hive, and by the drones appearing abroad more than usual: But the most certain sign is, when the bees refrain from flying into the fields, though the season be inviting. Just before they take flight, there is an uncommon silence in the hive; after this, as soon as one takes flight, they all follow. Before the subsequent swarmings, there is a great noise in the hives, which is supposed to be occasioned by a contest whether the young or the old queen should go out. When the bees of a swarm fly too high, they are made to descend lower, by throwing handfuls of sand or dust among them, which they probably mistake for rain. For the same purpose, it is usual to beat on a kettle or frying-pan; This practice may have taken its rise from observing that thunder or any great noise prompts such bees as are in the fields to return home.\n\nWhen the bees settle in swarming, they collect themselves in a heap, and hang to each other by their feet. When they settle in two separate divisions, it generally proceeds from there being two queens in the swarm. In that case, each cluster of them may be hived separately; or one of the queens must be destroyed, to prevent the commotions which the bees would raise in order to destroy her. All the motions and settling of a swarm are directed by the queen. If she be weak, and fall to the ground, the whole swarm fall down along with her; if she rest upon a branch of a tree, they accompany her; and if the queen be caught into a hive, the swarm will instantly follow her. When a swarm is too few in number for a hive, another may be added, provided the queen belonging to it be destroyed. If that precaution be not taken, a battle will ensue, in which not only one of the queens is killed, but frequently a great many of the working bees.\n\nSeveral methods of taking the wax and honey, without destroying the bees, have of late been practised. Mr Wildman's seems both to be the easiest and safest: \"Remove (says he) the hive from which you would take...\"\nthe wax and honey into a room, into which admit but little light, that it may appear at first to the bees as if it was late in the evening. Gently invert the hive, placing it between the frames of a chair, or other steady support, and cover it with an empty hive, keeping that side of the empty hive raised a little which is next the window, to give the bees sufficient light to get up into it. While you hold the empty hive, steadily supported on the edge of the full hive, between your side and your left arm, keep striking with the other hand all round the full hive from top to bottom, in the manner of beating a drum, so that the bees may be frightened by the continued noise from all quarters; and they will in consequence mount out of the full hive into the empty one. Repeat the strokes rather quick than strong round the hive, till all the bees are got out of it, which in general will be in about five minutes. It is to be observed, that the fuller the hive is of bees, the sooner they will have left it.\n\nAs soon as a number of them have got into the empty hive, it should be raised a little from the full one, that the bees may not continue to run from the one to the other, but rather keep ascending upon one another.\n\nSo soon as all the bees are out of the full hive, the hive in which the bees are must be placed on the stand from which the other hive was taken, in order to receive the absent bees as they return from the fields.\n\nIf this is done early in the season, the operator should examine the royal cells, that any of them that have young in them may be saved, as well as the combs which have young bees in them, which should on no account be touched, though, by sparing them, a good deal of honey should be left behind. Then take out the other combs with a long, broad, and pliable knife, such as the apothecaries make use of. The combs should be cut from the sides and crown, as clean as possible, to save the further labour of the bees, who must lick up the honey spilt, and remove every remains of wax; and then the sides of the hive should be scraped with a table-spoon, to clear away what was left by the knife. During the whole of this operation, the hive should be placed inclined to the side from which the combs are taken, that the honey which is spilt may not daub the remaining combs. If some combs were unavoidably taken away, in which there are young bees, the parts of the combs in which they are should be returned into the hive, and secured by sticks, in the best manner possible. Place the hive then for some time upright, that any remaining honey may drain out. If the combs are built in a direction opposite to the entrance, or at right angles with it, the combs which are the furthest from the entrance should be preferred, because there they are best stored with honey, and have the fewest young bees in them.\n\nHaving thus finished taking the wax and honey, the next business is to return the bees to their old hive; and for this purpose place a table, covered with a clean cloth, near the stand, and giving the hive in which the bees are a sudden shake, at the same time striking it pretty forcibly, the bees will be shaken on the cloth. Put their own hive over them immediately, raised a little on one side, that the bees may more easily enter; and when all are entered, place it on the stand as before. If the hive in which the bees are, be turned bottom uppermost, and their own hive be placed over it, the bees will immediately ascend into it, especially if the lower hive is struck on the sides to alarm them.\n\nThe chief object of the bees during the spring and beginning of summer, is the propagation of their kind. Honey during that time is not collected in such quantities as it is afterwards: and on this account it is scarcely worth while to rob a hive before the latter end of June; nor is it safe to do it after the middle of July, lest rainy weather prevent their restoring the combs they have lost, and laying in a stock of honey sufficient for the winter, unless there is a chance of carrying them to a rich pasture.\"\n\nMr Wildman, by his dexterity in the management of bees, has lately surprised the whole kingdom. He can order a swarm to light where he pleases, almost instantaneously; he can order them to settle on his head, then remove them to his hand; command them to depart and settle on a window, table, &c., at pleasure. We shall subjoin his method of performing these feats, in his own words: \"Spectators (says he) wonder much at my attaching bees to different parts of my body, and wish much to be possessed of the secret means by which I do it. I have unwarily promised to reveal it; and am therefore under a necessity of performing that promise; but while I declare, that their fear and the queen are the chief agents in these operations, I must warn my readers that there is an art necessary to perform it, namely practice, which I cannot convey to them, and which they cannot speedily attain; yet till this art is attained, the destruction of many hives of bees must be the consequence; as every one will find on their first attempt to perform it.\n\nLong experience has taught me, that as soon as I turn up a hive, and give it some taps on the sides and bottom, the queen immediately appears, to know the cause of this alarm; but soon retires again among her people. Being accustomed to see her so often, I readily perceive her at first glance; and long practice has enabled me to seize her instantly, with a tenderness that does not in the least endanger her person. This is of the utmost importance; for the least injury done to her brings immediate destruction to the hive, if you have not a spare queen to put in her place, as I have too often experienced in my first attempts. When possessed of her, I can, without injury to her, or exciting that degree of resentment that may tempt her to sting me, slip her into my other hand, and, returning the hive to its place, hold her there, till the bees missing her, are all on wing, and in the utmost confusion. When the bees are thus disturbed, I place the queen wherever I would have the bees to settle. The moment a few of them discover her, they give notice to those near them, and those to the rest; the knowledge of which soon becomes so general, that in a few minutes they all collect themselves round her; and are...\nso happy in having recovered this sole support of their state, that they will long remain quiet in their situation. Nay, the scent of her body is so attractive of them, that the slightest touch of her, along any place or substance, will attach the bees to it, and induce them to pursue any path she takes.\n\nMy attachment to the queen, and my tender regard for her precious life, makes me most ardently wish that I might here clothe the detail of this operation, which, I am afraid, when attempted by unskillful hands, will cost many of their lives; but my love of truth forces me to declare, that, by practice, I am arrived at so much dexterity in the management of her, that I can, without hurt to her, tie a thread of silk round her body, and thus confine her to any part in which she might not naturally wish to remain; or I sometimes use the least dangerous way of clipping her wings on one side.\n\nI shall conclude this account in the manner of C. Furius C\u00e6sarius, who being cited before the Curule Edile and an assembly of the people, to answer to a charge of sorcery, founded on his reaping much larger crops from his small spot of ground, than his neighbours did from their extensive fields, produced his strong implements of husbandry, his well-fed oxen, and a hale young woman, his daughter; and, pointing to them, said, These Romans, are my instruments of witchcraft; but I cannot shew you my toil, my sweats, and anxious cares. So may I say, These Britons, are my instruments of witchcraft; but I cannot shew you my hours of attention to this subject, my anxiety and care for these useful insects; nor can I communicate to you my experience, acquired during a course of years.\"\n\nWe shall conclude this history of the Honey-bee with the following experiments for preventing a waste of honey, and preserving the lives of bees during the winter, communicated by a gentleman near the banks of the Tweed. \"I have tried several experiments for preserving the lives of bees during the winter; and tho' in general with little success, yet I think I have reason to continue, and advise others to follow, what I practised last winter. The method is very simple, and not expensive, for it is no other than keeping the bees in a cold and dark place.\n\nMy reason for trying this experiment, was my having observed, that a certain degree of cold brought upon the bees a stupor; and that the same degree of cold continued, kept them in the same state, till they were brought into a warmer situation, which immediately restored their life and vigour *.\n\n* This observation is confirmed by what Mr White says, That bees which stand on the north-side of a building, whose height intercepts the sun's beams all the winter, will waste less of their provisions, almost by half, than others which stand in the sun; for, seldom coming forth, they eat little, and yet in the spring are as forward to work and swarm as those which had twice as much honey in the autumn before. See the Revd. Mr White's method of preserving bees. Third edition.\n\nWith this view I kept two hives shut up in a dark cold out-house, from the middle of September to the middle of April, without ever letting them see light: Upon their being set out in the warmer air, they recovered immediately, and showed an appearance of more strength than the hives did which had been kept out in the usual way. This appearance of strength continued during the summer, and they multiplied faster than I had ever observed them do before. They were rather later in swarming this year than in former summers; but the same was the case with many hives in this neighbourhood; and even though this should always happen, yet I think other advantages will do more than overbalance it. Could I go into the country early in the spring, to look after the bees myself, I would bring them into the open air some weeks sooner, carefully attend to the changes of the weather, and shut up the doors of the hive on a bad day: but this degree of care can scarcely be expected from servants and gardeners, who have many other things to attend to.\n\nI intend to have four hives put up this season, in the coldest dark place I can find; and as an ice-house is the steadiest and greatest cold we have, one or two of my friends who have ice-houses, have promised to put a hive upon the ice. By all accounts, the cold in Siberia does not kill the bees there; and in Russia, where the winters are extremely severe, bees produce much honey: so I think there is not any danger to be feared from any degree of cold we can expose the bees to.\n\nIf success continues to attend this experiment of keeping the bees asleep all the winter and spring, without consuming their honey, a great point will be gained; especially as Mr Wildman has taught us to take the honey without killing the bees: for, by what I have observed in this country, our bees are lost chiefly by being tempted to go out in a clear sun in the spring, though perhaps a frothy wind blows, and chills them, so as to prevent their being able to return to the hive; or an early warmth induces the queen to lay eggs, and a number of young bees are bred, which consume the little provision left, before the fields can afford any supply.\"\n\nExplanation of Plate XXIII.\n\nFigure 1. Is the queen bee. 2. Is the drone. 3. Is the working bee. 4. Represents the bees hanging to each other by the feet, which is the method of taking their repose. 5. The proboscis or trunk, which is one of the principal organs of the bees, wherewith they gather the honey and take their nourishment. 6. One of the hind-legs of a working-bee, loaded with wax. 7. A comb, in which the working bees are bred. The cells are the smallest of any. Two of them have the young bees inclosed. A royal cell is suspended on one side. 8. A comb in which the drones are bred, being larger than the former; the young drones being included in several of them; with two royal cells suspended on the side. 9. A similar comb, in which the royal cell is fixed in the middle of the comb; and several common cells are sacrificed to serve as a basis and\nand support to it. In general, the royal cells are suspended on the side of a comb, as in fig. 7, 8. To the side of fig. 9, two royal cells are begun, when they resemble pretty much the cup in which an acorn lies. The other royal cells have the young queens included in them.\n\nThe 23d species is the apis cunicularia, or hairy bee, with an iron-coloured breast, and yellow belly. This species is very like the mellicula; they build their nests in dry sandy places. 24. The variegata; the breast and belly are variegated with white and black spots; the legs are of an iron colour. It is a native of Europe. This species sleep in the geranium phaeum, or spotted crane's-bill. 25. The rostrata is distinguished by the upper lip being inflected, and of a conical shape, and by the belly being invested with bluish belts. They build their nests in high sandy grounds, and there is but one young in each nest. 26. The argillosa, or iron-coloured bee, has an inflected rostrum, and a crooked belly, with one joint. It is a native of Surinam. 27. The lagopoda is of a greyish colour, with an emarginated anus. 28. The manicata, or black bee, with hairy fore-legs; the belly is spotted with yellow; and the anus is tridentated. 29. The quatuor-dentata, is of a dusky colour, with five white belts on the belly, and the anus has four teeth-like protuberances; each intermediate tooth is forked. The last three species are natives of Europe. 30. The fasciata has a yellowish back, and a black belt round the edge of each wing; the breast is white; the belly is variegated with black and white; the legs are covered with black hair; and the feelers are green. It is a native of the Cape of Good Hope. 31. The barbara, or black bee, with a yellow edging round the breast, is about the size of an ant; the feelers are like threads. It is a native of Barbary. 32. The conica, or yellow bee, with an acute conical belly, and the margins of the joints or segments white; it dwells in cavities of the earth. 33. The annulata, or black bee, with a black front, and black rings round the legs. 34. The ruficornis has two iron-coloured spots on the breast and feelers; the belly is spotted with yellow. 35. The ferruginea, or smooth black bee, with the feelers, mouth, belly, and feet of an iron colour. This is a small bee, supposed to be of an intermediate kind between the bee and wasp. The last three are natives of Europe. 36. The ichneumonea; the rostrum or snout is an erect horn; the belly is petiolated and black; and the breast is interspersed with shining gold-coloured figures or indented lines; the antennae are green. It is a native of America. 37. The cariofa is a yellowish hairy bee; and the feet and front are of a bright yellow colour. It builds in the rotten trees of Europe. 38. The violacea is a red bee, and very hairy, with bluish wings. It is a native of Europe. The violacea is said to perforate trees, and hollow them out in a longitudinal direction; they begin to build their cells at the bottom of these holes, and deposit an egg in each cell, which is composed of the farina of plants and honey, or a kind of gluten. 39. The caffra is also red, and covered with hair; the hind part of the breast and fore-part of the belly are yellowish. 40. The carolina is a red hairy bee, with the upper part of the belly yellow. It is a native of Carolina. 41. The terrefricta is black and hairy, with a white belt round the breast, and a white anus. It builds its nest very deep in the earth. 42. The horatorium is a black hairy bee, with the fore part of the breast and belly yellow. 43. The pratorum, or black hairy bee, with the fore part of the breast yellow, and a blackish anus. 44. The lapidaria, or red hairy bee, with a yellow anus. It builds in holes of rocks. 45. The sylvarum, or pale hairy bee, with a black belt on the breast, and a reddish anus. 46. The muscorum, or yellow hairy bee, with a white belly. It builds in mossy grounds. 47. The hypnorum, or yellow hairy bee, with a black belt on the belly, and a white anus. 48. The lucorum, or yellow hairy bee, with a white anus. The last eight species are all natives of Europe. 49. The brasiliarum, or pale-red hairy bee, with the basis of the thighs black. This is a very large bee, every where covered with a testaceous skin. It is a native of America. 50. The acervorum is red and hairy, and builds below ground. 51. The subterranea is red and hairy, with a dusky anus; it likewise builds below ground. 52. The furnimansis is a black hairy bee, with the whole belly, excepting the first joint or segment, yellow. It is a native of Surinam. 53. The astuans, or black hairy bee, with a yellow breast. 54. The tropica, or black hairy bee, with the hind part of the belly yellow. The two last are natives of the warm climates. 55. The alpina is a hairy bee, with a black breast, and yellow belly. It inhabits the mountains of Lapland.","sp":381,"ep":391},{"h":"APIUM","t":"or Parsley, in botany, a genus of the pentandra digynia clasps.

When all or any of the given decimals are circulates, make all the circles conterminous, find the number of tens to be carried from the left-hand column of the circles, add this carriage to the right hand column, and proceed as in addition of integers.\n\nIf repeaters be mixed with the circulates, give the repeaters the form of circulates, by extending the repeating figures till they become conterminous with the other circles.\n\nIf finite decimals are joined with the circulates, extend the finite parts of all the circulates to as many places as there are figures in the longest finite.\n\nExamp. \\( \\frac{3}{9} = .428571, = .428571, \\)\n\\( \\frac{9}{9} = .857142, = .857142, \\)\n\\( \\frac{5}{5} = .45, = .454545, \\)\n\\( \\frac{1}{7} = .370, = .370370, \\)\n\n2.110630\n\nIn order to find the carriage from the left-hand column of the circles, add the columns next to it on the right, saying, 7 + 5 + 5 + 2 = 19; from which carry 1, and say, 1 + 3 + 4 + 8 + 4 = 20; from which carry 2, and go on to add the right-hand column of the circle, saying, the carriage 2 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 10; so set down 0, and carry 1, and proceed with the rest as in integers.\n\nThe adding the carriage from the left-hand column of the circles to the column on the right hand, arises from the flux of numbers; for as the circles repeat infinitely, if we suppose a new feet of the same circles to be repeated upon the right of our examples, it is plain, that in adding them the carriage from the left-hand column of the new feet would naturally fall into the right-hand column of our example.\n\nThe operation here is the same as in addition of vulgar fractions; for every circle is the numerator of a vulgar fraction, whose common denominator is 999999; and if the circles or numerators be added, without minding any carriage from the left-hand column, the sum will be 2110628.\n\nAnd 999999)2110628(2110628\n\nBut, by pointing off from the sum of the circles six figures towards the right, we divide by 1000000, instead of dividing by 999999; which gives indeed the same quot, but makes the remainder too small.\n\nNow, that the carriage-figure from the left-hand column of the circles, is the integral part of the quot, and at the same time the difference between the true and false remainder, is evident; for the quotient-figure 2, multiplied into the two divisors 1000000 and 999999, gives two products, whose difference is 2; and consequently, if the greatest product, viz. 2 X 1000000 = 2000000, be subtracted from the dividend, the result will want 2 of the true remainder. To prevent such errors, and to put the work on a sure footing, find the carriage from the left-hand column of the circles, add this carriage to the right-hand column, divide the sum by 1000000, and you will have a true quot, and a true remainder. The learner may look back to division of integers.\nintegers, where the method of dividing by 9,99,999, &c., is explained.\n\nHence it follows, that if we add the circles as they stand, without minding any carriage from the left, and to the sum add the excrescent figure on the left of the decimal point, we shall have the full sum of the circles, both as to the integral and fractional part, as in the margin.\n\nPure repeaters, being the numerators of vulgar fractions, whose denominator is 9 as often taken as the digit is repeated, may be added in the same manner as circles. But in examples clear of circulates, the method prescribed in Case II. is preferable.\n\nIn adding circles and pure repeaters by the method now explained, it will sometimes happen that the fractional part of the sum will be a series of nines, as in the margin: And in this case, the numerator of the fraction being the same with the denominator, its value will be unity; and accordingly it must be added to the integral part. But in adding pure repeaters by the method in Case II. this cannot happen.\n\nBy way of proof, we shall here add all the vulgar fractions in Examp. I. and reduce their sum to a mixt number, continuing the division to a decimal.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{6}{7} + \\frac{5}{7} + \\frac{2}{7} = \\frac{6217}{4333} + \\frac{13474}{4333} + \\frac{6615}{4333} + \\frac{5399}{4333} = \\frac{30716}{4333}.\n\\]\n\nHere the dividual being the same with the second, a new circle begins.\n\nIV. Subtraction of Decimals.\n\nRule I. Place the minor under the major, so that that the points may be in one column; and then, if the given decimals be finite or approximate, work as in subtraction of integers.\n\nIf the major and minor have not the same number of places, imagine the void places to be filled up with ciphers.\n\nExample I.\n\n| L. | s. | d. | L. |\n|----|----|----|----|\n| From | 48 | 10 | 6 = 48.525 |\n| Sub. | 18 | 12 | 8\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) = 18.634375 |\n| Rem. | 29 | 17 | 9\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) = 29.890625 |\n\nExample II.\n\n| C. | Q. | lb. | C. |\n|----|----|----|----|\n| From | 54 | 2 | 21 = 54.6875 |\n| Sub. | 36 | 3 | 14 = 36.875 |\n| Rem. | 17 | 3 | 17 = 17.8125 |\n\nApproximates.\n\nIn subtracting approximates, neglect the right-hand figure of the remainder, as uncertain; but an unit borrowed on the right must be repaid, as in the two examples following.\n\nEx. 1.\n\n| From | 783.0625 |\n| Sub. | 495.28571 |\n\nRem. 287.7767 certain.\n\nRule II. If one of the given decimals is a repeater, and the other a finite decimal, give the repeater one place more than the finite decimal, and in subtracting borrow 9 on the right hand.\n\nBut if both major and minor repeat, give them an equal number of places, and then subtract as above.\n\nEx. 1.\n\n| From | .7145833 |\n| Sub. | .634375 |\n\nRem. .0802083\n\nIn Ex. 1. and 2. you give the repeater one place more than the finite decimal, and by this means you obtain the repeating figure of the remainder. But in Ex. 3. you give the two repeaters an equal number of places.\n\nIn Ex. 2. and 3. you borrow 9 on the right hand.\n\nRule III. If both the given decimals be circulates, make the circles conterminous, and work as in integers; only if, in the left-hand column of the circles, you foresee, that, in subtracting the figure of the minor from that of the major, one must be borrowed, in this case add 1 to the right-hand figure of the minor, and then subtract.\n\nIf one of the given decimals be a circulate, and the other a repeater, give the repeater the form of a conterminous circulate, and then subtract.\n\nIf one of the given decimals be a circulate, and the other a finite decimal, extend the finite part of the circulate to as many places as there are figures in the finite decimal, and then subtract.\n\nExample I.\n\n| From | .6428571 |\n| Sub. | .17857142 |\n\nRem. .46428571\n\nIn this example, because, in the left-hand column of the\nthe circles, 8 cannot be subtracted from 2 without borrowing; therefore add 1 to the right-hand figure of the minor, and say, 1+2=3, and 3 from 4, and 1 remains. The reason is obvious: for, supposing the circles reiterated on the right of the example, it would be, 8 from 2 you cannot, but 8 from 12 and 4 remains; 1 borrowed, and 2, make 3, &c.\n\n**Example II.**\n\nFrom \\( \\frac{1}{2} = .9285714 \\), \\( = .9285714 \\),\nSub. \\( \\frac{3}{7} = .6 \\)\n\\( = .6666666 \\),\n\nRem. \\( .2619047 \\),\n\nIn the above example the repeaters are given in the form of conterminous circulates.\n\n**Example III.**\n\nFrom \\( \\frac{5}{7} = .384615 \\), \\( = .384615384 \\),\nSub. \\( \\frac{1}{8} = .125 \\)\n\\( = .125 \\),\n\nRem. \\( .259615384 \\),\n\nIn the last example the finite part of the circulate is extended to as many places as there are figures in the finite decimal, by which means like things come to be subtracted, and you obtain the exact circle of the remainder.\n\n**V. Multiplication of Decimals.**\n\nIn multiplication and division there may happen nine varieties, arising from the different nature of the numbers that may occur in the operation; and these are of three sorts, viz. integers, mixt numbers, and pure decimals.\n\nNow, since the multiplier or divisor may be of three kinds, and the multiplicand or dividend of as many, there must of consequence be nine varieties; which are these following.\n\nAn integer may multiply or divide\n\n- an integer,\n- a mixt number,\n- a pure decimal.\n\nA mixt number may multiply or divide\n\n- an integer,\n- a mixt number,\n- a pure decimal.\n\nA pure decimal may multiply or divide\n\n- a mixt number,\n- a pure decimal.\n\nOf these varieties, the first belongs properly to vulgar arithmetic, the other eight occur in decimal operations.\n\nBut in multiplication and division of decimals, there will occur other nine varieties, arising likewise from the nature of the numbers; which may either be finite, repeating, or circulating.\n\nAnd since the multiplier or divisor may be of three sorts, and the multiplicand or dividend of as many, there must of course be nine varieties; and these are so obvious, that it would be losing time here to enumerate them.\n\nBefore entering on multiplication, we shall lay down a rule for pointing the product, which is of a general nature, and extends to decimals of every sort, whether finite, repeating, or circulating; and is as follows.\n\n**General Rule.**\n\nGive so many decimal places to the product, on the right, as are in both factors; and if the product has not so many figures, supply that defect by prefixing ciphers.\n\nWe now proceed to multiplication.\n\n**Rule I.** If both factors are finite or approximate, work exactly as in multiplication of integers.\n\n| Ex. 1. | Ex. 2. |\n|-------|-------|\n| .785  | .125  |\n| .75   | .25   |\n| 3925  | 625   |\n| 5495  | 250   |\n\n|       |       |\n|-------|-------|\n| .58875| .03125|\n\nIn Ex. 2. the product not affording so many decimal places as are in the multiplicand and multiplier, the defect is supplied by prefixing ciphers.\n\nThe reason of giving as many decimal places to the product as are in both factors, appears by considering that the operation is the same here as in multiplication of vulgar fractions. Thus, \\( .785 \\times .75 = \\frac{785}{1000} \\times \\frac{75}{100} = \\frac{58875}{100000} = .58875 \\).\n\nTo multiply by 10, 100, 1000, &c., move the decimal point so many places toward the right hand as there are ciphers in the multiplier.\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n.4375 \\times 10 &= 4.375 \\\\\n.4375 \\times 100 &= 43.75\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAnd thus:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n6.875 \\times 10 &= 68.75 \\\\\n6.875 \\times 100 &= 687.5\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Approximates.**\n\nIn multiplying approximates, the certain places of the product may be determined by one or other of the two rules following, viz.\n\n1. If both factors are approximates, the uncertain places of the product will be one more than the number of places in the longest factor.\n\n2. If one of the factors be finite, and the other approximate, the uncertain places of the product will be one more than the number of places in the finite factor.\n\n| Ex. 1. | Ex. 2. |\n|-------|-------|\n| 245.118 | .2105264 |\n| -3529+ | 2.875 |\n| 2206062 | 1052630 |\n| 490236 | 1473682 |\n| 1225590 | 1684208 |\n| 735354 | 421052 |\n| 86.5021422 | .60526250 |\n\nIn Ex. 1. the integral part of the product, viz. 86, is certain, and all the decimal places on the right are uncertain. In Ex. 2. only four places on the left, viz. .6052, are certain, and all the other places uncertain.\n\nThe reason of Rule 1. is plain. For if in Ex. 1. we make the longest factor the multiplier, and the total product will be the same either way, it is obvious, that in this case we shall have six particular products, in each of which the right-hand figure will be uncertain, and consequently...\nconsequently we shall have six uncertain places in the total product toward the right, and also one uncertain place more on account of the uncertain carriage from the column in which the right-hand figure of the last particular product stands.\n\nThe reason of Rule 2. is also obvious. For in Ex. 2. by making the finite factor the multiplier, we have four particular products, in each of which the right-hand figure is uncertain; and so we have four uncertain places in the total product, and one uncertain place more arising from the uncertain carriage.\n\nThe carriage in some cases may affect several columns on the left, and thereby render so many more figures uncertain.\n\nThe surest way therefore to determine the certain places in the product of approximates, is by a second operation, giving the approximates contrary signs; for then, so far as the two products agree, the figures are certain. The second operations of the two former examples follow.\n\n| Ex. 1. | Ex. 2. |\n|--------|--------|\n| 245.117+ | .210527- |\n| .353- | 2.875 |\n| 235351 | 1052635 |\n| 1225585 | 1473689 |\n| 735351 | 1684216 |\n| 86.526301 | 421054 |\n| .605265125 |\n\nIn Ex. 1. 865 is certain, and all the other figures uncertain. In Ex. 2. .60526 are the only certain places.\n\nBecause the multiplication of decimals that consist of many places, proves, in the way hitherto practised, a tedious operation, we shall here explain a method whereby decimals of this sort, whether finite or approximate, may be multiplied expeditiously, and at the same time have the decimal places in the product limited to any number proposed. This may be effected by the following\n\n**Rule.** Under the multiplicand place the multiplier inverted, so that its units place may stand under that place of the multiplicand to which you propose to limit the product; then multiply the right-hand figure of the multiplier into that figure of the multiplicand which stands directly over it, taking in the carriage from the right, and go on to multiply it into all the other figures on the left. Proceed in like manner with every other figure of the multiplier, placing the right-hand figures of all the particular products directly under other. The total product will be approximate, and the right-hand figure uncertain.\n\nTo make this rule more easily understood, the reader may look back to the multiplication of integers; where it was observed, that instead of beginning with the right-hand figure of the multiplier, we may begin with the left, and still have a just product, provided the right-hand figure of every particular product be placed directly under the multiplying figure. Now, the working an example, both in this manner, and also by the rule, and comparing the steps and results of the two opera-\n\ntions, will throw a light upon the matter, and unfold the reason of the rule. Which take as follows.\n\nMultiply 18.634375 into 9.875, and limit the product to four decimal places.\n\n| By the rule. | By the other method. |\n|--------------|---------------------|\n| 18.634375    | 18.634375           |\n| 578.9        | A 9.875             |\n| 1677093      | 167709375           |\n| 149075       | 149075000           |\n| 13044        | 130440625           |\n| 931          | 93171875            |\n| 184.0143+    | 184.014353125       |\n\nIn working by this rule, you invert the multiplier, and place 9, the units figure, under 3, the fourth place of decimals, because the product is limited to four decimal places; then multiply, saying, \\(9 \\times 3 = 27\\), and 6 carried from the right makes 33, &c. In multiplying by 8, say, \\(8 \\times 4 = 32\\), and 3 of carriage makes 35; so set 5 under 3; and proceed in like manner to multiply the figures on the left. The right-hand figure of the product is defective, as wanting the carriage from the columns cut off on the right by the line A B. The figures expressing the sum of the columns so cut off, are so many uncertain places of the product, when the factors are approximate, and on that account to be rejected as useless. The figures, moreover, on the right of the line A B, show how far the operation is contracted, or how much labour is saved in working by the rule.\n\nIf there be no units in the multiplier, in this case set the right-hand figure of the inverted multiplier under that figure of the multiplicand, below which it would have stood had there been units.\n\n**Ex.** Multiply .825 by .825, limiting the product to three decimal places.\n\n| By the rule. | The common way at large. |\n|--------------|-------------------------|\n| .825         | .825                    |\n| 528.         | .825                    |\n| 660          | 4125                    |\n| 16           | 16150                   |\n| 4            | 66000                   |\n| .680+        | .680625                 |\n\nThe decimal places of the factors may either be retained at full length, or turned into approximates before you begin to multiply.\n\n**Ex.** Multiply 25.849013625 by 42.97235, limiting the product to two decimal places.\n\n| 25.849013625 | 42.97235 |\n|--------------|----------|\n| 53279.24     |          |\n| 103396       |          |\n| 5169         |          |\n| 2326         |          |\n| 180          |          |\n| 5            |          |\n| 1110.76+     |          |\nWe shall next turn the decimals of the former example into approximates, and then the operation will be as follows.\n\n| By the rule. | Common way at large. |\n|--------------|----------------------|\n| 25.85\u2014       | 25.85\u2014               |\n| +79.24       | 42.97+               |\n| 103400       | 18095                |\n| 5170         | 23265                |\n| 2326         | 5170                 |\n| 180          | 10340                |\n\nProd. 1110.76+ 1110.7745\n\nIt remains to be observed, that the want of carriage from the right hand may sometimes affect more columns on the left than one, and thereby occasion more uncertain figures in the product than that on the right hand. The best security on this head is, never to limit the product to fewer than four or five decimal places.\n\nTo conclude, when decimals to be multiplied are long, you may frequently perform the operation more easily in vulgar fractions, and then reduce the product to a decimal.\n\n**Rule II.** If the multiplier be finite, and the multiplicand repeat, in multiplying carry at 9 on the right hand; and before you add, prolong the repetends of the particular products, till their right-hand figures stand directly under one another; and in adding, carry at 9 on the right hand.\n\nThe product repeats, as in Ex. 1, 2, &c.; or turns out finite, as in Ex. 6.\n\nEx. 1.

Division of Decimals.**\n\nBefore we enter on division, it will be proper to observe, that there are two rules for pointing the quot, both which are general in their nature, and extend to decimals of every sort, whether terminate or interminate; but unwilling to perplex the learner with too many things at once, we shall at present lay down only one of these rules; and afterwards, when the rule now to be assigned appears to be sufficiently exemplified, shall then bring the other rule upon the field.\n\n**General Rule.**\n\nThe decimal places in the divisor and quot together must always be equal in number to those of the dividend.\nThe five following practical directions will make the application of the general rule easy.\n\n1. When the divisor and dividend have an equal number of decimal places, the quotient comes out an integer; as in Ex. 2.\n\n2. When the decimal places of the dividend are more than those of the divisor, the number of decimal places in the quotient must be equal to the excess; as in Ex. 1, 4, and 8.\n\n3. When the decimal places of the divisor are more than those of the dividend, annex ciphers to the dividend, so as to make them equal, and the quotient, by direction 1, will be integers; as in Ex. 3, 5, and 7.\n\n4. When, after division is finished, the quotient has not so many figures, as, by the general rule, it ought to have decimal places, supply that defect by prefixing ciphers; as in Ex. 6.\n\n5. If, after the dividend is exhausted, there be a remainder, annex a cipher, or ciphers, to the remainder, and continue the division till it remain, or till the quotient repeat or circulate, or till you think proper to limit it; as in Ex. 9, 10, 11, and 12.\n\nWe now proceed to division.\n\nRule I. If the divisor and dividend are both finite or approximate, work exactly as in division of integers.\n\n| Ex. 1 | Ex. 2 |\n|------|------|\n| .75)58875(.785 | 2.5)182.5(73 |\n| 525 ** | 175 |\n| 627 | 75 |\n| 600 | 75 |\n\nIn Ex. 1. A decimal divides a decimal; and because the dividend has five decimal places, and the divisor only two, give three decimal places to the quotient, according to Direction 2.\n\nIn Ex. 2. A mixt number divides a mixt number, and the divisor and dividend having an equal number of decimal places, the quotient comes out an integer, according to Direction 1.\n\nThe reason of the rule for pointing the quotient is obvious; for multiplication gives as many decimal places to the product as are in both factors; but the dividend is the product of the divisor and quotient, and so has as many decimal places as are in both; consequently the decimal places in the divisor and quotient together must be equal in number to those of the dividend.\n\n| Ex. 3 | Ex. 4 |\n|------|------|\n| .85)476( | 7).875(.125 |\n| .85)476.00(560 | 7 ** |\n| 425 ** | 17 |\n| 510 | 14 |\n| 510 | 35 |\n\nIn Ex. 3.

General Rule.\n\nThe place of the first figure of the quot is the same with the place of that figure in the dividend which stands over the units of the first product.\n\nThus, in the example of integers in the margin, the figure 0, that stands over 5, the units of the product of \\(9 \\times 35\\) is in the place of hundreds; and therefore 9, the first figure of the quot, is likewise hundreds; and so the quot is 917 integers.\n\nTo illustrate the rule, we shall give decimal places to the dividend of the above example; and thereby exhibit the varieties that will occur in pointing the quot.\n\nVariety 1.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n35 \\times 32095 = 115 \\\\\n35 \\times 32095 = 115 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nVariety 2.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n35 \\times 32095 = 115 \\\\\n35 \\times 32095 = 115 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nIn all the above varieties, the figure 0 in the dividend stands over the units of the first product; and in Var. 1, the figure 0 is in the place of tens, and accordingly 9, the first figure of the quot, is tens; in Var. 2, the figure 0 is in the place of units, and so 9 is units; in Var. 3, the figure 0 is in the place of primes, and so 9 is primes, &c.\n\nHere observe that 9, the first significant figure of the quot, in all the above varieties, as well as in the varieties that follow, must always be considered, in multiplying the divisor, as an integer; and, in pointing the first product, no decimal place is to be allowed for it.\n\nWe shall now keep the dividend an integer, and give decimal places to the divisor.\n\nVar. 1.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n35 \\times 32095 = 115 \\\\\n35 \\times 32095 = 115 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nVar. 2.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n35 \\times 32095 = 115 \\\\\n35 \\times 32095 = 115 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nIn Var. 1, say, \\(9 \\times 35 = 315\\); and the unit 1 standing under the place of thousands, the figure 9 is also thousands; and as 0 at last remains, annex a cipher for the decimal .5 in the divisor; then dividing, you get 0 to the quot; and because 9 stands in the place of thousands, the quot is wholly integers.\nIn Var. 2, the unit 3 stands under the place of ten-thousands, and so 9 is ten-thousands; and to the remainder 0 annex .00, for the two decimal places in the divisor; then dividing, you get 00 to the quot; and because 9 stands in the place of ten-thousands, the quot continues to be wholly integers. The process is the same in Var. 3, and 4.\n\nLastly, we shall allow decimal places to both dividend and divisor.\n\n| Var. 1. | Var. 2. |\n|--------|--------|\n| 3.5)320.95(91.7 | 3.5)32.095(9.17 |\n| 31.5 ** | 31.5 ** |\n| 59 | 59 |\n| 35 | 35 |\n| 245 | 245 |\n| 245 | 245 |\n\nVar. 3:\n\n| Var. 4. |\n|--------|\n| 3.5)32005(.917 | 3.5)32095(.0917 |\n| 31.5 ** | 31.5 ** |\n| 59 | 59 |\n| 35 | 35 |\n| 245 | 245 |\n| 245 | 245 |\n\nIn Var. 1, the units of the first product stand under tens of the dividend; and so 9, the first figure of the quot, is tens. In Var. 2, the units of the first product stand under units of the dividend, and so 9 is units. In Var. 3, the units of the first product stand under primes, and so 9 is primes, &c.\n\nTo divide by 10, 100, 1000, &c. is to move the decimal point one place toward the left for every cipher in the divisor.\n\nThus,\n\n| 10)768(768 | 10)17.28(17.28 |\n|----------|----------------|\n| 100)768(768 | 100)17.28(17.28 |\n| 1000)768(768 | 1000)17.28(17.28 |\n| 10000)768(.0768 | 10000)17.28(.001728 |\n\nAPPROXIMATES:\n\nIn dividing approximates, the certain places of the quot may be determined by the following\n\nRule. Place the divisor under the first dividend, and the number of certain figures in the quot shall be one less than the number of places from the left of the divisor to the first + or \u2014, whether in the divisor or in the dividend.\n\nEx. 1.\n\nDividend 1110.79286078\u2014 Dividend 1110.7929\u2014\nDivisor 42.9723+ Divisor 25.8490136+\nCertain places five, where- Certain places six, where-\nof three are decimals. of four are decimals.\n\nBut here it is to be observed, that the uncertain car-\n\nriage may, in some cases, effect several columns on the left, and thereby render more figures of the quot uncertain than the rule prescribes. The surest way, therefore, is, to make two operations with contrary signs, and then the figures in which the two quots agree are certain.\n\nIn order to make the reason of the rule appear, it will be necessary to work an example.\n\nExample.\n\nA\n\n42.9723+1110.79286078\u2014(25.849.\n\n859446***\n\n2513468\n2148615\n3648536\n3437784\n2107520\n1718892\n3886287\n3867507\n18780\n\nB\n\nHere we stop, no more places being certain. The reason is obvious; for the right-hand figure of the first product, viz., 6, is uncertain; and consequently all the figures under it, on the right of the line A B, will be so too; that is, the last remainder and new dividend are uncertain, and of course the figure that would go next to the quot.\n\nFrom this example it appears, that all the figures on the right of the line A B are uncertain and useless; if therefore a way of working, without writing down these useless figures, can be found, we shall then have a method of dividing long decimals, whether finite or approximate, so as to contract the operation, and limit the product to any number of decimal places proposed. And this may be effected by observing the following\n\nRule. Write the product of the first quotient-figure under the dividend; and from the situation of the units place, consider how many figures of the dividend must be retained to give the quot the number of decimal places intended; cut off the other figures on the right, and also the figures corresponding to them on the right of the divisor; then subtract; esteem this and every following remainder a new dividend; and for each new dividend drop a figure on the right of the divisor; but in multiplying the quotient-figures into the divisor, take in the carriage from the right hand; as in the following examples.\n\nEx. I. Divide 95.432756463275 by 3.4637528; and limit the quot to four decimal places.\nIn working the same example at large, the line A B shows how far the operation is contracted, and how much labour is saved.\n\nBut here observe, that by the rule for approximates the certain places of the quot are no more than five, viz. 27.551. And therefore, in all operations of this kind, care should be taken to limit the quot to so many places certain; as is done in the following example.\n\n**Exampl. II.** Divide 87.0763264525 by 9.365407024; limiting the quot to four decimal places certain.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n9.365407024)87.0763264525(9.2976 \\\\\n\\hline\n84.288663216 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n278766 \\\\\n187308 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n91458 \\\\\n84288 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n7170 \\\\\n6555 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n615 \\\\\n561 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nHere we put a stop to the operation; because, by the rule for approximates, the next figure of the quot would be uncertain.\n\nWe shall conclude division of finite decimals with two very useful problems.\n\n**Prob. I.** From a given multiplier to find a divisor that gives a quot equal to the product.\n\n**Rule.** Divide an unit with ciphers annexed by the given multiplier, and the quot will be the divisor sought.\n\n**Exampl.** What divisor will give a quot equal to the product of 125 into the dividend?\n\nGiven multiplier 125)1.000(.008 divisor sought.\n\nNow, if any number be divided by .008, and the same number be multiplied by 125, the quot and product will be equal.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n.008)7315.000(914375 quot. \\\\\n\\hline\n72 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n11 \\\\\n8 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n7315 \\\\\n125 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n35 \\\\\n32 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n36575 \\\\\n14630 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n30 \\\\\n24 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n7315 \\\\\n914375 product. \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe reason is plain: for an unit contains the quot .008 just 125 times; and consequently .008 dividing any number\nber will give a quot 125 times greater than the dividend; that is, the quot will be equal to the product of the dividend multiplied by 125.\n\nProb. II. From a given divisor to find a multiplier that gives a product equal to the quot.\n\nRule. Divide an unit with ciphers annexed by the given divisor, and the quot will be the multiplier sought.\n\nExamp. What multiplier will give a product equal to the quot arising from the same number divided by .008?\n\nGiven divisor .008)1.000(125 multiplier sought.\n\nNow, if any number be multiplied by 125, and the same number be divided by .008, the product and quot will be equal; as appears in the example following.\n\nRule II. If a finite divisor divide a repeating dividend, work as in integers; but in continuing the division, instead of annexing ciphers to the remainder, annex the repeating figure of the dividend.\n\nRule III. If a finite divisor divide a circulating dividend, work as in integers; but in continuing the division, instead of annexing ciphers to the remainder, annex the circulating figures of the dividend.\n\nRule IV. If the divisor be indeterminate, reduce it to a vulgar fraction, as taught in reduction of decimals, Prob. V.; then multiply the given dividend by the denominator, and divide the product by the numerator.\n\nHere there are six cases; for the divisor may either repeat or circulate, and may divide a finite, a repeating, or circulating dividend.\n\nCase I.

Or rather work thus: Esteem 2724.46341, a circulate; and then you find the numerator of the vulgar fraction by subtracting the finite part.\nNext divide this fractional numerator by the denominator; which is done by multiplying 3589 by 99999, as in the margin; and now the simple vulgar fraction to be annexed to the partial quot is\n\n\\[ \\frac{27441617}{378888417} \\]\n\nIf the quot thus completed be multiplied by the divisor, it will produce the dividend.\n\nVII.

At 3 s. 4 d. what cost 346?\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n346 & \\text{The decimal of the} \\\\\n15 & \\text{rate is } .16 = \\frac{1}{6} \\\\\n\\hline\n1730 & \\\\\n346 & \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nL. s. d.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n45 & \\\\\n69 & \\\\\n63 & \\\\\n60 & \\\\\n54 & \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nTable of Rates and Divisors.\n\n| Rates | 0 Farth. | 1 Farth. | 2 Farth. | 3 Farth. |\n|-------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| d.    | Divis.   | Divis.   | Divis.   | Divis.   |\n| 0     |          |          |          |          |\n| 1     | 6,40.    | 8,64.    | 8,60.    | 8,40.    |\n| 2     | 4,30.    | 4,30.+8. | 4,30.+4. | 4,30.-8. |\n| 3     | 80.      | 80.+12.  | 80.+6.   | 80.+4.   |\n| 4     | 60.      | 60.+4+4 of 4. | 60.+8. | 60+8+2 of 8. |\n| 5     | 6,8.     | 40.-8.   | 40-12.   | 40-4 of 6. |\n| 6     | 40.      | 40+4 of 6. | 40+12. | 40+8. |\n| 7     | 40+6.    | 40+6+4 of 6. | 40+4. | 40+4+6 of 4. |\n| 8     | 30.      | 30+4 of 8. | 30+2 of 8. | 80x3-12 of 80. |\n| 9     | 80x3.    | 80x3.+12 of 80. | 80x3.+6 of 80. | 80x3.+4 of 80. |\n| 10    | 8,3.     | 30.+4.+8 of 4. | 20.-8. | 40.+2.+2.+6. |\n| 11    | 20,-12.  | 40x2.-8 of 40. | 40x2.-12 of 40. | 8,3.+5,-8 of .5 |\n\nIn the above table the pence stand in the left-hand column, and the farthings on the head, and the divisors in the angle of meeting; which are to be understood and read as follows.\n\n3;8,40. Divide the given number of goods by 3, divide the quot by 8, and again divide this last quot by 40.\n\n4,30,-8. Divide the number of goods by 4, divide the quot by 30, and from this last quot subtract one 8th of itself.\n\n80+12. To an 80th add a 12th of that 80th.\n\n4,30,+4. To a 30th of a 4th add a 4th of that 30th.\n\nEx. 2. At 6 s. 8 d. what cost 439?\n\nThe decimal of the rate is .3\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n3)439(146.3 = 146 6 8\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nMethod II. When the rate consists of pence and farthings, find how often it is contained in one pound Sterling, divide the given number of goods by this number, or by its component parts, or work by aliquot parts, and the result will be the price sought.\n\nWe confine this method to such rates as consist of pence and farthings, because when the rate consists of shillings, pence, and farthings, or of pounds, shillings, pence, &c., it is shorter and easier to work by Method I.\n\nTo make the practice ready and easy, it will be proper to have at hand a table of rates and divisors, such as the following one.\n60, + 4 of 4. Divide by 60, divide again the quot by 4, and to the first quot add a 4th of the second quot.\n\n80 \u00d7 3, \u2014 12 of 80. Divide by 80, multiply the quot by 3, and from the product subtract a 12th of the first quot.\n\nEx. 1. At 1 l. per yard, what cost 432 yards?\n\nOne 3d = 144\nOne 8th of that = 18\nOne 40th of that = .45 = 9s.\n\nEx. 2. At 3 l. what cost 728.5?\n\nOne 8th = 91.0625 L. s. d.\nOne 40th of that = 2.2765625 = 2 5 6\u00bd\n\nMeth. III. The third method is by decimal tables of rates suited to the nine digits; such as those composed and published by the Rev. Mr George Brown in 1718, under the title of *Arithmetica Infinita*, and recommended by Dr John Keill professor of astronomy in the university of Oxford.\n\nThese tables are still extant, and extend from 1 farthing to 20s.; a short specimen of which, with their construction, and the manner of using them, we shall here subjoin.\n\n**Decimal Table of Rates, 1 l. the integer.**\n\n| Rate | Rate | Rate |\n|------|------|------|\n| s. d. | s. d. | s. d. |\n| N.   | 11 5 | 11 5\u00bc | 11 5\u00bd | 11 5\u00be |\n| 1    | 0.57083 | 0.571875 | 0.572916 | 0.5739583 |\n| 2    | 1.1416 | 1.14375 | 1.14583 | 1.147916 |\n| 3    | 1.7125 | 1.715625 | 1.71875 | 1.721875 |\n| 4    | 2.283 | 2.2875 | 2.2916 | 2.29583 |\n| 5    | 2.85416 | 2.859375 | 2.864583 | 2.8697916 |\n| 6    | 3.425 | 3.43125 | 3.4375 | 3.44375 |\n| 7    | 3.99583 | 4.003125 | 4.010416 | 4.0177083 |\n| 8    | 4.583 | 4.575 | 4.583 | 4.5916 |\n| 9    | 5.1375 | 5.146875 | 5.15625 | 5.165625 |\n\nIn the left-hand column stand the nine digits; and on the right of 1 are the decimals of the respective rates on the head. Thus, .57083 is the decimal of 11 s. 5 d., one pound being the integer; and .571875 is the decimal of 11 s. 5\u00bc d., &c. Those decimals opposite to 1 being multiplied through the nine digits, make up or compose the rest of the table.\n\nThe superior excellency of tables thus constructed is, that we multiply or divide by 10, 100, 1000, &c. by moving the decimal point so many places to the right or left as there are ciphers in the multiplier or divisor.\n\nHence the price or value of any number of yards, or other things, denoted by a single digit, or by any of its decuples, may be readily found. Thus, the price of 7, 70, 700, 7000, 70000 yards, at 11 s. 5 d. per yard, is found as follows.\n\nYards | L. s. d.\n---|---\n7 | 3.99583 = 3 19 11\n70 | 39.9583 = 39 19 2\n700 | 399.583 = 399 11 8\n7000 | 3995.83 = 3995 16 8\n70000 | 39958.3 = 39958 6 8\n700000 | 399583.3 = 399583 6 8\n\nNow, every number may be resolved into decuples of the several digits of which it is composed; find therefore the price of each decuple by itself, as already taught, and their sum will be the price of the whole.\n\n**Examp. 1.** Required the price of 7956 yards, at 11 s. 5\u00bc d. per yard.\n\nYards | L.\n---|---\n7000 | 4017.708333\n900 | 516.5625\n50 | 28.697916\n6 | 3.44375\n\nL. s. d.\n4566.412500 = 4566 8 3\n\n**Examp. 2.** How much money will one spend in a year, or 365 days, at the rate of 11 s. 5\u00bc d. per day?\n\nDays | L.\n---|---\n300 | 171.875\n60 | 34.375\n5 | 2.864583\n\nL. s. d.\n209.114583 = 209 2 3\u00bd\n\nTables of this sort may be framed for a great variety of useful purposes, and are easily constructed.\n\nThus, suppose a table wanted for showing the daily income of any annuity, or yearly pension; in this case, divide 1 by 365, and the quot is the income of 1l. annuity for one day; and by multiplying this quot through the nine digits, the table is constructed as follows.\n\n**Table.**\n\n| 1 | 0.02739726 |\n| 2 | 0.05479452 |\n| 3 | 0.08219178 |\n| 4 | 0.10958904 |\n| 5 | 0.13698630 |\n| 6 | 0.16438356 |\n| 7 | 0.19178082 |\n| 8 | 0.21917808 |\n| 9 | 0.24657534 |\n\nThe use of the table will best appear by examples; which take as follows.\n\n**Example 1.** If one has a yearly pension of 375l. what is his daily income?\n\nL.\n300 = .8219\n70 = .1917\n5 = .0136\n\nL. s. d.\n1.0272 = 1 0 6\u00bd\n\n**Example 2.** The yearly rent of a gentleman's estate is 968l. 10s. what can he afford to spend per day?\n\nL. 900\nIf the income for any number of days be required, find the income for one day as above; and multiply the decimal answer by the given number of days. Or, multiply the yearly pension by the given number of days, and use the product as the yearly pension. Thus, in Ex. 2., if the gentleman's income for 64 days be demanded, you may either multiply 2.6532 by 64; or multiply 968.5 by 64; and then work for the product as follows.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n968.5 & \\quad 60000 = 164.3835 \\\\\n64 & \\quad 1000 = 2.7397 \\\\\n& \\quad 900 = 2.4657 \\\\\n38740 & \\quad 80 = .2191 \\\\\n58110 & \\quad 4 = .0109\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThe decimals in the table being circles of eight figures, we have used them as approximates, by confining the operations to four decimal places; which, in affairs of this kind, is sufficiently accurate.\n\nIf the annual interest of any principal sum be considered as the yearly pension, the interest of the same principal for any number of days may be found by the table as taught above.\n\nThe interest of any principal sum for a year is easily found, as being always the hundredth part of the product of the principal multiplied by the rate per cent.\n\n**Example.** Required the interest for 26 days of 685 l. principal, at 5 per cent.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nL. & \\quad 685 \\\\\n& \\quad 5 \\\\\n& \\quad 34.25 \\text{ annual interest} \\\\\n26 & \\quad 800 = 2.19178 \\\\\n20550 & \\quad 90 = .24657 \\\\\n6850 & \\quad 0.5 = .00136\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nDecimal practice may be used with great advantage in the multiplication and division of duodecimals, where the integer is divided into twelve equal parts, called primes, and each prime into twelve seconds, each second into twelve thirds, &c.\n\nFor the ready conversion of primes, seconds, thirds, &c. into decimals of the integer, the following table is constructed.\n\n| N. | Primes | Seconds | Thirds | Fourths |\n|----|--------|---------|--------|---------|\n| 1  | .083   | .0069   | .000578 | .00004822 |\n| 2  | .16    | .0138   | .001157 | .00009645 |\n| 3  | .25    | .0208   | .001736 | .00014467 |\n| 4  | .3     | .027    | .002314 | .00019290 |\n| 5  | .416   | .03472  | .002993 | .00024112 |\n| 6  | .5     | .0416   | .003672 | .00028935 |\n| 7  | .583   | .0486   | .004350 | .00033757 |\n| 8  | .6     | .0556   | .004629 | .00038580 |\n| 9  | .75    | .0625   | .005208 | .00043402 |\n| 10 | .83    | .0694   | .005787 | .0004815 |\n| 11 | .916   | .0763   | .006365 | .00053047 |\n\nIn the column of fourths, the decimals run on to eight places of a finite part, and nine figures of a circle; but the finite part by itself, which alone is inserted in the table, will be found sufficient; and in the column of thirds too, the circle of three figures may in most cases be neglected.\n\n**I.

They are commonly marked as under.\n\n**Signs. deg. min. sec. thirds.**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n7 & \\quad 24 \\quad 36 \\quad 54 \\quad 48 \\quad \\text{etc.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSexagesimals properly belong to astronomy, being used in computations of motion and time, where the degree of motion, and hour of time, are equally divided into 60 minutes. The preference of the decimal method to that of the sexagesimal will appear from the following example of addition done both ways.\n\n**Sexagesimally.**\n\n| Signs | S. |\n|-------|----|\n| 10    | 20 |\n| 47    | 17 |\n| 17    | 10.69293,518, |\n\n**Decimally.**\n\n| Signs | S. |\n|-------|----|\n| 7     | 18 |\n| 50    | 40 |\n| 7.62814,814, |\n\n| 9     | 25 |\n| 30    | 28 |\n| 9.85018,518, |\n\n| 11    | 10 |\n| 40    | 50 |\n| 11.35601,851, |\n\n| 3     | 15 |\n| 49    | 7 |\n| 3.52728,703, |\n\nFrom the above example it is obvious, that even in addition the decimal operation is more simple and easy than the sexagesimal, especially if care be taken to use no more decimal places than what are absolutely necessary.\n\nBut in multiplication and division the advantage of the decimal method is still greater; for in the sexagesimal way the operation is extremely tedious; whereas, by working decimally, it is performed in the same manner, and with the same ease, as in duodecimals.\n\n**Vulgar Fractions.**\n\nDecimal practice may sometimes be profitably used in the\nthe arithmetic of vulgar fractions, the operation being shorter and easier in the decimal than in the vulgar way. This we shall illustrate by a few examples.\n\nI. Addition.\n\nEx. 1.

XII. Extraction of Roots.\n\nIf unity be multiplied continually by any given number, the products thence arising are called powers of that number; and the given number is called the root, or first power.\n\nThus, if 2 be the given number, then \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\) is the root or first power; and \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) is the square or second power; and \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\) is the cube or third power; and \\(8 \\times 2 = 16\\) is the biquadrate or fourth power; and \\(16 \\times 2 = 32\\) is the quintuple or fifth power; and \\(32 \\times 2 = 64\\) is the sixth power, or cube squared, &c.\n\nThe natural numbers, 1, 2, 3, &c., are sometimes placed over these powers, denoting the number of multiplications used in producing them, or showing what powers they are; and are called indices or exponents, as in the following scheme.\n\nIndices, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, &c.\n\nPowers, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, &c.\n\nThe raising any root or number given to any power required, is called involution; and is performed by multiplying the given root into unity continually, as taught above. But the finding the root of a given power is called evolution, or extraction of roots.\n\nIf the root of any power not exceeding the seventh power, be a single digit, it may be obtained by inspection, from the following table of powers.\n\n| Table |\n|-------|\n| 1     | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   |\n| 2     | 4   | 8   | 16  | 32  | 64  | 128 | 256 |\n| 3     | 9   | 27  | 81  | 243 | 729 | 2187| 6561|\n| 4     | 16  | 64  | 256 | 1024| 4096| 16384| 65536|\n| 5     | 25  | 125 | 625 | 3125| 15625| 78125| 390625|\n| 6     | 36  | 216 | 1296| 7776| 46656| 279936| 1679616|\n| 7     | 49  | 343 | 2401| 16807| 117649| 830641| 5764801|\n\nI. Extraction of the Square Root.\n\nRule I. Divide the given number into periods of two figures, beginning at the right hand in integers, and pointing toward the left. But in decimals, begin at the place of hundreds, and point toward the right. Every period will give one figure in the root.\n\nII. Find by the table of powers, or by trial, the nearest lesser root of the left-hand period, place the figure so found in the quot, subtract its square from the said period, and to the remainder bring down the next period for a dividend or resolvend.\n\nIII. Double the quot for the first part of the divisor; inquire how often this first part is contained in the whole resolvend, excluding the units place; and place the figure denoting the answer both in the quot and on the\nthe right of the first part; and you have the divisor complete.\n\nIV. Multiply the divisor thus compleated by the figure put in the quot, subtract the product from the resolvend, and to the remainder bring down the following period for a new resolvend, and then proceed as before.\n\nNote 1. If the first part of the divisor, with unity supposed to be annexed to it, happen to be greater than the resolvend, in this case place o in the quot, and also on the right of the partial divisor; to the resolvend bring down another period; and proceed to divide as before.\n\nNote 2. If the product of the quotient-figure into the divisor happen to be greater than the resolvend, you must go back, and give a lesser figure to the quot.\n\nNote 3. If, after every period of the given number is brought down, there happen at last to be a remainder, you may continue the operation, by annexing periods or pairs of ciphers, till there be no remainder, or till the decimal part of the quot repeat or circulate, or till you think proper to limit it.\n\nExamp.

Thus, the square root of \\( \\frac{4}{9} \\) is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\), and the root of \\( \\frac{4}{9} \\) is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\); and thus the root of \\( \\frac{4}{9} \\) (=6\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)) is \\( \\frac{2}{3} = 2\\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\nBut if the root of either the numerator or denominator cannot be extracted without a remainder, reduce the vulgar fraction to a decimal, and then extract the root, as in Example III, above.\n\nII. Extraction of the Cube Root.\n\nRule I. Divide the given number into periods of three figures, beginning at the right hand in integers, and pointing toward the left. But in decimals, begin at the place of thousands, and point toward the right. The number of periods shews the number of figures in the root.\n\nII. Find by the table of powers, or by trial, the nearest lesser root of the left-hand period; place the figure so found in the quot; subtract its cube from the said period; and to the remainder bring down the next period for a dividual or resolvend.\n\nThe divisor consists of three parts which may be found as follows.\n\nIII. The first part of the divisor is found thus: Multiply the square of the quot by 3, and to the product annex two ciphers; then inquire how often this first part of the divisor is contained in the resolvend, and place the figure denoting the answer in the quot.\n\nIV. Multiply the former quot by 3, and the product by the figure now put in the quot; to this last product annex a cipher; and you have the second part of the divisor. Again, square the figure now put in the quot for the third part of the divisor; place these three parts under one another, as in addition; and their sum will be the divisor complete.\n\nV. Multiply the divisor, thus completed, by the figure last put in the quot, subtract the product from the resolvend, and to the remainder bring down the following period for a new resolvend, and then proceed as before.\n\nNote 1. If the first part of the divisor happen to be equal to or greater than the resolvend, in this case place o in the quot, annex two ciphers to the said first part of the divisor, to the resolvend bring down another period, and proceed to divide as before.\n\nNote 2. If the product of the quotient-figure into the divisor happen to be greater than the resolvend, you must go back, and give a lesser figure to the quot.\n\nNote 3. If, after every period of the given number is brought down, there happen at last to be a remainder, you may continue the operation by annexing periods of three ciphers till there be no remainder, or till you have\nas many decimal places in the root as you judge necessary.\n\n**Examp.

Put \\(a+y\\) for the root, and then the sursolid or fifth power will be \\(aaaaa + 5aaaa + 10aaa + 10aa + 5a + y\\). Now, \\(aaaaa\\) being already subtracted, there remains the other five parts; and to find \\(y\\), divide by its coefficient, viz. by \\(aaaaa + 10aaa + 10aa + 5a + y\\); that is, try how often \\(aaaaa\\) is contained in the resolvend; and, by the help of the quotient-figure, you make up the other four parts of the divisor.\n\n**Examp.** Required the sursolid root of 33554432\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n33554432(32 \\text{ root.}) \\\\\n\\hline\n243 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\\(9254432\\) resolv.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n4050000 = 5aaaa \\\\\n540000 = 10aaa \\\\\n36000 = 10aa \\\\\n1200 = 5a \\\\\n16 = y \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nDivisor \\(4627216 \\times 2 = 9254432\\) prod.\n\n**V.

Extraction of the root of the eighth power.\n\n**Rule.** Extract the square root of the given number.\n\ncontinually till you have three roots; the last of these is the root sought.\n\nThus, let 1785793904896 be the eighth power; by extracting the square root you get the biquadrate or fourth power, viz. 1336336; and by extracting the square root of the biquadrate, you get the square or second power, viz. 1156, whose square root is 34, the root sought.\n\nVIII. Extraction of the root of the ninth power.\n\n**Rule.** Extract the cube root of the given number, and you have the cube or third power, whose cube root is the root sought.\n\nThus, let 5159780352 by the ninth power; by extracting the cube root you get the cube or third power, viz. 1728, whose cube root 12 is the root sought.\n\nUniversally, whatever the given power be, put \\(a + y\\) for the root, and by involution raise \\(a + y\\) to the power of the given number; then, with this as your guide or canon, extract the root in the manner prescribed and exemplified in the extraction of the root of the fifth and seventh powers.\n\nBut if the index of the given power be a multiple of 2, the work may be rendered easier: For, by extracting the square root of the given number, you obtain a power whose index is one half of the index of the given power. Thus, by extracting the square root of the tenth power, you have the fifth power; and the square root of the twelfth power is the sixth power, &c.\n\nAgain, if the index of the given power be a multiple of 3, by extracting the cube root you obtain a power whose index is one third of the index of the power given. Thus the cube root of the ninth power is the cube or third power; and the cube root of the twelfth power is the biquadrate or fourth power, &c.\n\nInvolution is directly contrary to extraction or evolution; and therefore, if a square number be squared, it will give the biquadrate or fourth power; and if a biquadrate be squared, it will give the eighth power. Again, if a cube number be cubed, it will give the ninth power; and if the biquadrate be cubed, it will give the twelfth power. See Algebra, Chap.

See Plate XXXVIII. fig. 1.\n\nThe ark has afforded several points of curious inquiry among the critics and naturalists, relating to its form, capacity, materials, &c.\n\nThe wood whereof the ark was built, is called in the Hebrew Gopher-wood, and in the Septuagint square timbers. Some translate the original cedar, others pine, &c.\nothers box, &c. Pelletier prefers cedar, on account of its incorruptibility, and the great plenty of it in Asia; whence Herodotus and Theophrastus relate, that the kings of Egypt and Syria built whole fleets thereof, instead of cedal.\n\nThe learned Mr Fuller in his Miscellanies, has observed, that the wood whereof the ark was built, was nothing else but that which the Greek call \u03ba\u03c5\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2, or the cypriss-tree; for, taking away the termination, kypar and gopher differ very little in sound. This observation the great Bochart has confirmed, and shewn very plainly that no country abounds so much with this wood as that part of Assyria which lies about Babylon.\n\nIn what place Noah built and finished his ark is no less made a matter of disputation. But the most probable opinion is, that it was built in Chald\u00e6a, in the territories of Babylon, where there was so great a quantity of cypresses in the groves and gardens in Alexander's time, that that prince built a whole fleet out of it, for want of timber. And this conjecture is confirmed by the Chaldean tradition, which makes Xithurus (another name for Noah) set sail from that country.\n\nThe dimensions of the ark, as given by Moses, are 300 cubits in length, 50 in breadth, and 30 in height, which some have thought too scanty, considering the number of things it was to contain; and hence an argument has been drawn against the authority of the relation. To solve this difficulty many of the ancient fathers, and the modern critics, have been put to very miserable shifts: But Buteo and Kircher have proved geometrically, that, taking the common cubit of a foot and a half, the ark was abundantly sufficient for all the animals supposed to be lodged in it. Snellius computes the ark to have been above half an acre in area, and father Lamy shews, that it was 110 feet longer than the church of St Mary at Paris, and 64 feet narrower; and if so, it must have been longer than St Paul's church in London, from west to east; and broader than that church is high in the inside, and 54 feet of our measure in height; and Dr Arbuthnot computes it to have been 81062 tons.\n\nThe things contained in it were, besides eight persons of Noah's family, one pair of every species of unclean animals, and seven pair of every species of clean animals, with provisions for them all during the whole year. The former appears, at first view, almost infinite; but if we come to a calculation, the number of species of animals will be found much less than is generally imagined, not amounting to an hundred species of quadrupeds, nor to two hundred of birds; out of which, in this case, are excepted such animals as can live in the water. Zoologists usually reckon but an hundred and seventy species in all; and bishop Wilkins shews that only seventy-two of the quadruped kind needed a place in the ark.\n\nBy the description Moses gives of the ark, it appears to have been divided into three stories, each ten cubits, or fifteen feet high; and it is agreed on, as most probable, that the lowest story was for the beasts, the middle for the food, and the upper for the birds, with Noah and his family; each story being subdivided into different apartments, stalls, &c. Though Josephus, Philo, and other commentators, add a kind of fourth story under all the rest; being, as it were, the hold of the vessel, to contain the ballast, and receive the filth and faeces of so many animals: But F. Calmet thinks, that what is here reckoned a story, was no more than what is called the keel of ships, and served only for a conservatory of fresh water. Drexelius makes three hundred apartments. F. Fournier, three hundred and thirty-three; the anonymous author of the Questions on Genesis, four hundred; Buteo, Temporarius, Arias Montanus, Hofius, Wilkins, Lamy, and others, suppose as many partitions as there were different sorts of animals. Pelletier makes only seventy-two, viz. thirty-five for the birds, and as many for the beasts; his reason is, that if we suppose a greater number, as 333, or 400, each of the eight persons in the ark must have had thirty-seven, forty-one, or fifty stalls to attend and cleanse daily, which he thinks impossible to have been done. But it is observed, that there is not much in this; to diminish the number of stalls without a diminution of animals is vain; it being perhaps more difficult to take care of three hundred animals in seventy-two stalls, than in three hundred. As to the number of animals contained in the ark, Buteo computes that it could not be equal to five hundred horses; he even reduces the whole to the dimensions of fifty-six pair of oxen. F. Lamy enlarges it to sixty-four pair of oxen, or an hundred and twenty-eight oxen; so that supposing one ox equal to two horses, if the ark had room for two hundred and fifty-six horses, there must have been room for all the animals. But the same author demonstrates, that one floor of it would suffice for five hundred horses, allowing nine square feet to a horse.\n\nAs to the food in the second story, it is observed by Buteo from Columella, that thirty or forty pounds of hay ordinarily suffices for an ox a day, and that a solid cubit of hay, as usually pressed down in our hayricks, weighs about forty pounds; so that a square cubit of hay is more than enough for one ox in one day. Now it appears that the second story contained 150,000 solid cubits, which divided between two hundred and six oxen, will afford each more hay by two thirds, than he can eat in a year. Bishop Wilkins computes all the carnivorous animals, equivalent, as to the bulk of their bodies, and their food, to twenty-seven wolves; and all the rest to two hundred and eighty beesves. For the former he allows 1825 sheep, and for the latter, 109,500 cubits of hay, all which will be easily contained in the two first stories, and a deal of room to spare. As to the third story, no body doubts of its being sufficient for the fowls; with Noah, his sons, and daughters. Upon the whole, the learned bishop remarks, that of the two, it appears much more difficult to affix a number and bulk of necessary things to answer the capacity of the ark, than to find sufficient room for the several species of animals already known to have been there. This he attributes to the imperfection of our list of animals, especially\nSpecially those of the unknown parts of the earth; adding, that the most expert mathematician at this day could not assign the proportion of a vessel better accommodated to the purpose than is here done; and hence finally concludes, that the capacity of the ark, which had been made an objection against scripture, ought to be esteemed a confirmation of its divine authority, since, in those rude ages, men, being less versed in arts and philosophy, were more obnoxious to vulgar prejudices than now; so that had it been an human invention, it would have been contrived, according to those wild apprehensions which arise from a confused and general view of things, as much too big, as it had been represented too little.\n\nBut it must be observed, that besides the places requisite for the beasts and birds, and their provisions, there was room required for Noah to lock up household utensils, the instruments of husbandry, grains and seeds, to sow the earth with after the deluge; for which purpose it is thought that he might spare room in the third story for six and thirty cabins, besides a kitchen, a hall, four chambers, and a space about eight and forty cubits in length to walk in.\n\nArk of the covenant, a small chest or coffer, three feet nine inches in length, two feet three inches in breadth, and two feet three inches in height, in which were contained the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod, and the tables of the covenant. This coffer was made of shittim-wood, and was covered with the mercy-seat, which was of solid gold; at the two ends whereof were two cherubims, looking toward each other, with expanded wings, which, embracing the whole circumference of the mercy-seat, met on each side in the middle.

All the species of spiders have eight legs, with three joints in each, and terminating in three crooked claws; eight eyes, two before, two behind, and the rest on the sides of the head. The mouth consists of two claws or talons, denticulated like a saw. A little below the point of the claw, there's a small hole, through which the spider emits a kind of poison. These claws are the weapons with which they kill flies, &c., for their food. The belly or hinder part is separated from the head and breast by a small thread-like tube. The skin or outer surface is a hard polished crust. Spiders have five tubercles or nipples at the extremity of the belly, whose apertures they can enlarge or contract at pleasure. It is through these apertures that they spin a gluey substance with which their bellies are full. They fix the end of their threads by applying these ripples to any substance, and the threads lengthen in proportion as the animal recedes from it. They can stop the issuing of the threads by contracting the nipples, and re-ascend by means of the claws on their feet, much in the same manner as some men warp up a rope. When the common house-spider begins her web, she generally chuses a place where there is a cavity, such as the corner of a room, that she may have a free passage on each side, to make her escape in case of danger. Then she fixes one end of her thread to the wall, and passes on to the other side, dragging the thread along with her, (or rather the thread follows her as she proceeds), till she arrives at the other side, and there fixes the other end of it. Thus she passes and repasses, till she has made as many parallel threads as she thinks necessary for her purpose. After this, she begins again and crosses these by other parallel threads, which may be named the woof. These are the toils or snares which she prepares for entangling flies, and other small insects, which happen to light upon it. But, besides this large web, she generally weaves a small cell for herself, where she lies concealed watching for her prey. Betwixt this cell and the large web, she has a bridge of threads, which, by communicating with the threads of the large one, both give her early intelligence when anything touches the web, and enables her to pass quickly in order to lay hold of it. There are many other methods of weaving peculiar to different species of spiders. But, as they are all intended for the same purpose, it is needless to give particular descriptions of them.\n\nLinnaeus enumerates 47 species of spiders, viz. 1. The diademata, has a globular reddish belly, with a white cross. It inhabits the birch-tree. 2. The reticulata, has a reticulated round belly, and is dusky or purple on the back. It frequents gardens. 3. The cucurbitina, has a globular yellow belly, with a few black spots. It lives in the leaves of trees, and incloses its eggs in a soft net. 4. The calycina, with a round pale yellow belly, and two hollow points. It lives in the cups of flowers, after the flower-leaves have fallen off, and catches bees, and other flies, when they are in search of honey. 5. The otopunctata, with a roundish yellow belly, four black marks on each side, and a red anus. It is a native of Sweden. 6. The bipunctata, with a round red belly, and two hollow points. It frequents windows. 7. The arundinacia, with a white roundish belly, and dusky-coloured spots. It frequents reeds. 8. The angulata, with an oval belly; the fore-part of the sides form an acute angle. It frequents trees. 9. The domestica, or common house-spider, has a dusky oval belly, with five contiguous black spots. 10. The trilineata, with a white belly, and three longitudinal lines of blackish spots. It lives in woods. 11. The riparia, has an oval glazed black belly, and a yellowish forked hairy anus. It lives in the sandy banks of rivers. 12. The labyrinthica, with a dusky oval belly, a whitish indented line, and a forked anus. The web of this species is horizontal, with a cylindrical well or tube in the middle. 13. The quadrilinata, has a roundish yellow belly, and four spots and four purple lines on each side. It is a native of Sweden. 14. The redimita, has an oblong yellow belly, and a red oval ring on the back. It frequents gardens. 15. The coronata, has a black oval belly, and an oval white ring on the back. It dwells upon plants. 16. The fumigata, has a dusky oval belly, and two white points at the base. It lives in the fields. 17. The montana, has a white oval belly, with ash-coloured spots. It lives in trees. 18. The languinolenta, has a blood-coloured belly, with a black longitudinal line. It is a native of Spain. 19. The notata, has an oval dusky-coloured belly, with white transverse lines. 20. The rufipes, has a dusky belly, and reddish legs. It most frequently lives among nettles. 21. The nocturna, has a black belly, with two white points, and a little white half-moon at the base of the anus. 22. The extensa, has a long greenish shining belly, and its legs are extended longitudinally. It frequents marshy grounds. 23. The fimbriata, has a black oblong belly, with a white line on each side, and dusky-coloured legs. It lives in water, upon the surface of which it runs with great swiftness. 24. The sexpunctata, has an oblong belly, and three pair of hollow points. It lives in woods. 25. The flavissima, has a smooth oblong belly of a very yellow colour. It is a native of Egypt. 26. The bimaculata, has a chestnut-coloured roundish belly, with two white points. 27. The clavipes, has an oblong belly, and the last joints of the legs, excepting the third pair, are hairy and clavated. It is a native of America. 28. The quadripunctata, has a black oblong belly, and four hol-\nlow points. It is to be met with in windows, &c.\n\n29. The holoscelesa, has an ovalish belly covered with a down like velvet; at the base, or under part, it has two yellow spots. It is found in the folded leaves of plants.\n\n30. The fenoculata, is distinguished from the rest by having only six eyes.\n\n31. The avicularia, has a convex round breast, hollowed transversely in the middle. It is a native of America, and feeds upon small birds, insects, &c. The bite of this spider is as venomous as that of the serpent.\n\n32. The spinimobilis, has moveable black spines on its legs. It is a native of Surinam.\n\n33. The venatoria, is a hairy spider, with a round convex breast, about the same size with the belly, which is oval. It is a native of America.\n\n34. The ocellata, has three pair of eyes on its thighs. It is about the same size with the tarantula, of a pale colour, with a black ring round the belly, and two large black spots on the sides of the breast. It is a native of China.\n\n35. The tarantula, Plate XXIII. fig. 10. The breast (1), and belly (2), are of an ash-colour; the legs (3) are likewise ash-coloured, with blackish rings on the under part; the fangs, or nippers (4), are red on the inner side, the rest being blackish; (5) is the antennae or feelers: Two of its eyes are larger than the other, red, and placed in the front; four other eyes are placed in a transverse direction towards the mouth; the other two are nearer the back. It is a native of Italy, Cyprus, Barbary, and the E. Indies. The breast and belly are about two inches long, terminated by two short tails. This figure was taken from the life, in the island of Cyprus, by Alex Drummond, Esq., late consul at Aleppo. The bite of the tarantula is said to occasion an inflammation in the part, which in a few hours brings on sickness, fainting, and difficulty of breathing: The person afterwards is affected with a delirium, putting himself into the most extravagant postures. However, this is not always the case; for they are sometimes seized with a deep melancholy. The same symptoms return annually, in some cases, for several years, and at last terminate in death. Music is said to be the only cure. It induces the patient to dance, and sweat out the poison.\n\n36. The fconcica, is a black jumping spider, with three white semicircular lines across its body. It frequents old walls.\n\n37. The truncorum, is a black jumping spider, with white spots on the back. It frequents walls, and old wood.\n\n38.

The aquatica, is of a livid colour, with an oval belly, and a transverse line, and two hollowed points. It frequents the fresh waters of Europe; and lodges, during the winter, in empty shells, which it dextrously shuts up with a web.\n\n40. The faccata, has an oval belly of a dusky iron colour. It lives in the ground, and carries a sack with its eggs, where-ever it goes. This sack it glues to its belly, and will rather die than leave it behind.\n\n41. The palustris, has an oblong cloudy belly, with two white lines on each side. It frequents marshy grounds.\n\n42. The virefascens has an oblong greenish yellow belly, with white lines on the sides. It frequents gardens.\n\n43. The viatica, has a roundish plain belly, with the four last legs shorter than the others. It frequents gardens, and sits upon its eggs.\n\n44.

The general characters of this order are these: The bill is straight, sharp, long, and somewhat compressed, with a furrow that runs from the nostrils towards the point; the nostrils are linear; and the feet have four toes. This genus consists of 26 species; and under it Linnaeus comprehends the grus or crane, the ciconia or stork, and the ardea or heron, of other authors. The first species is the pavonina, or crowned crane, which has an erect bristly crest, with the temples and two wattles naked. The head is black; the crest is yellowish, and tipped with black at the top; the wings are white; and the feathers of the tail black, and of an equal length. It is a native of Africa.\n\n2. The virgo has long white supercilias that hang down backwards. The body is of a bluish ash-colour, and about the size of a stork; the head and prime feathers of the wings towards the points are black and pendulous; the edges are red, and the pupils are ash-coloured; behind the eyes, on both sides, there is a feathery crest, which turns backwards a considerable way, and is of a white colour: The feet are black; the beak is green at the base, yellowish in the middle, and red at the point.\n\n3. The canadensis, or brown and ash-coloured crane of Edwards, is naked and papillosus on the forehead; the body is ash-coloured, and the wings are of a reddish or brick-colour.\n\n4. The grus, or common crane of English authors, has a naked papillosus crown; the prime feathers of the wings are black; the body is ash-coloured; the prime feathers of the tail are ragged. It is a native of Europe and Africa. It winters in Lithuania, Padodia: Trans Pontum fugat et terris immittit apricis. Virg. This bird commonly rests upon one foot.\n\n5. The americana, or hooping crane of Edwards, is a native of America: The crown of the head and temples are naked and papillosus; the forehead, nape of the neck, and prime wing-\nwing-feathers are black; but the body is white: The under part of the head, as far as the lower cap, is red; the beak is yellowish, and jagged at the point; the feet are red, and the prime tail-feathers white. 6. The Antigone, or greatest Indian crane of Edwards, has a naked head, and papillous collar; the body is ash-coloured, and the prime wing-feathers black. Behind the eyes, there is a small white spot, and the crown of the head is also white. The breast is of a greenish yellow colour; the feet are red, and the prime tail-feathers ash-coloured. It is a native of Asia. 7. The ciconia, or white stork of Ray, has naked eye-balls, and black prime wing-feathers. The skin below the feathers, as also the beak, feet, and claws, are of a blood-colour. It is a native of Europe, Asia, and Africa; but is seldom or never to be met with in Italy. The ciconia feeds upon amphibious animals. It is such an enemy to serpents, that it is reckoned almost a crime to kill a stork. From this favourable treatment, they are seen in Holland and the Low Countries walking unconcerned in the middle of the streets. Storks are birds of passage; they spend the summer in Europe, and disappear all at once, and go off to Egypt, Ethiopia, &c. before winter, and do not return till about the middle of March. 8. The nigra, or black stork of Willoughby, has naked orbits, and the breast and belly are white; the body is black; the feet and orbits are blood-coloured. It inhabits the northern parts of Europe. 9. The nycticorax, or lesser ash-coloured heron of Ray, has a crest, consisting of three short horizontal white feathers, on the back part of the head; the back is greenish, and the belly yellow. It inhabits the southern parts of Europe. 10. The purpurea, or common heron of English authors, has a crest, with two long green feathers hanging down from the back part of the head; the body is of an olive-colour, and purple below; the head is of a shining green colour. It is a native of the East. 11. The cinerea, or ash-coloured heron, has a smooth black head, a bluish back, white belly, and oblong black spots on the breast. It is a native of Europe. Great numbers of them together build their nests in trees. They are said to fly very high before storms. 12. The major has a black crest depending from the back part of the head, an ash-coloured body, and a black line and belt on the neck and breast. It is a native of Europe. 13. The garzetta is crested behind; the body is white, the beak black; and the feet greenish. It is a native of the East. 14. The cocoi has an ash-coloured crest hanging down from the back part of the head; the whole body is ash-coloured. It is a native of Cayenne. 15. The herodias is crested behind, has a dusky-coloured back, reddish thighs, and the breast speckled with oblong black spots. It is a native of America. 16. The violacea has a white crest; the body is variegated with black and white, and bluish below. It is a native of America. 17. The caerulea has a crest behind, and a bluish body. It is a native of N. America. 18. The hudsonia has a black crest on the top of the head; the body is dusky-coloured, and white below. It frequents Hudson's Bay. 19. The striata has a small crest on the back-part of the head; the back is of a hoary grey colour, and ash-coloured below; the long wing-feathers are tipped with white. It is a native of Surinam. 20.

The stellaris, or bittern, has a smooth head; it is variegated through the whole body with dark-coloured spots of different figures and sizes. It is a native of Europe, and inhabits chiefly the fen-countries. It is met with skulking among the reeds and sedges, and its usual posture is with the head and neck erect, and the beak pointed directly upwards. It will suffer persons to come very near it without rising; and has been known to strike at boys and at sportmen, when wounded and unable to make its escape. It flies principally about the dusk of the evening, and then rises in a very singular manner, by a spiral ascent, till it is quite out of sight. It makes a very strange noise when it is among the reeds, and a different and very singular one as it rises on the wing in the night. 22. The grisea has a smooth dusky head; the body is tawny above, and white below; and the prime wing-feathers have a black spot at the points. It is a native of the East. 23. The braflidensis has a smooth head; the body is blackish, with yellow spots; and the prime feathers of the wings and tail are greenish. It is a native of America. 24. The alba has a smooth head, a white body, a yellow beak, and black feet. It is a native of Europe. 25. The aquinoctialis has a smooth head, and a white body. It is a native of America. 26.

In effect, their number seems not to have been fixed, but to have been more or less in different years. At first, this tribunal consisted only of nine persons, who had all discharged the office of Archons, had acquitted themselves with honour in that trust, and had likewise given an account of their administration before the Logistae, and undergone a rigorous examination. Their salary was equal, and paid out of the treasury of the republic; they had three oboli for each cause. The Areopagites were judges for life; they never sat in judgment but in the open air, and that in the nighttime, to the intent that their minds might be the more present and attentive, and that no object of pity or aversion might make any impression on them; and all the pleadings before them were to be in the simplest and most naked terms. At first they took cognizance of criminal causes only, but in course of time their jurisdiction became of great extent.\n\nMr Spon, who examined the antiquities of that illustrious city, found some remains of the Areopagus still existing in the middle of the temple of Theseus, which was heretofore in the middle of the city, but is now without the walls. The foundation of the Areopagus is a semicircle, with an esplanade of 140 paces round it, which properly made the hall of the Areopagus. There is a tribunal cut in the middle of a rock, with seats on each side of it, where the Areopagites sat exposed to the open air.

IX. VULGAR FRACTIONS.\n\nA Fraction is a part or parts of an unit, or of any integer or whole; and is expressed by two numbers, one above and the other below a line drawn between them; as, $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe number under the line shews into how many parts the unit or integer is divided; and is called the denominator, because it gives name to the fraction: The number above the line shews or tells how many of these parts the fraction contains; and is therefore called the numerator.\n\nIn the fraction $\\frac{1}{4}$ l. a pound Sterling is the unit, integer, or whole; and the denominator 4 shews that the pound is broken or divided into four equal parts, viz. 4 crowns; and the numerator 3 shews that the fraction contains three of these parts, that is, three crowns; and so the value of this fraction is fifteen shillings.\n\nCor. 1. Hence it follows, 1. When the numerator of a fraction is less than the denominator, the value of such a fraction is less than unity, or the integer. 2. When the numerator is equal to the denominator, the value of the fraction is exactly an unit or integer. 3. When the numerator is greater than the denominator, the value of the fraction is more than an unit; and so often as the denominator is contained in the numerator, so many units or wholes are contained in the fraction. If, therefore the numerator of a fraction be divided by the denominator, the quot will be a number of units or integers, and the remainder so many parts.\n\nThe numerator of a fraction is to be considered as a dividend, and the denominator as a divisor; and the fraction itself may be taken to denote the quotient.\n\nCor. 2. From this view of a fraction, it is evident, that if the numerator and denominator of a fraction be either both multiplied or both divided by the same number, the products or quotients will retain the same proportion to one another; and consequently the new fraction thence arising will be of the same value with the given one. Thus the numerator and denominator of the fraction $\\frac{3}{4}$ multiplied by 2 produces $\\frac{6}{8}$, and divided by 2 quots $\\frac{1}{2}$, both which fractions are of the same value with $\\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nFractions having 10, 100, 1000, or 1, with any number of ciphers annexed to it, for a denominator, are call-\ned decimal fractions; and fractions having any other denominator are called vulgar fractions.\n\n1. A proper fraction is that whose numerator is less than its denominator, and consequently is in value less than unity; as \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\n2. An improper fraction is that whose numerator is equal to or greater than its denominator; and consequently is in value equal to or greater than an unit; as \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\), \\( \\frac{7}{6} \\).\n\n3. A simple fraction is that which has but one numerator, and one denominator; and may be either proper or improper; as \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) or \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\).\n\n4. A compound fraction is made up of two or more simple fractions, coupled together with the particle of, and is a fraction of a fraction; as \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\), or \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) of \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\).\n\n5. A mixt number consists of an integer, and a fraction joined with it; as \\( 7\\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nBecause in most cases fractions can neither be added nor subtracted, till they be reduced, we begin with reduction.\n\nReduction of Vulgar Fractions.\n\nProblem I. To reduce an improper fraction to an integer, or mixt number.\n\nRule. Divide the numerator by the denominator, the quot gives integers; and the remainder, if there be any, placed over the divisor or denominator, gives the fraction to be annexed.\n\nExamples.\n\n1. \\( \\frac{85}{9} = 9 \\) integers, there being no remainder.\n2. \\( \\frac{54}{7} = 7 \\) integers, the remainder being 5.\n3. \\( \\frac{98}{14} = 7 \\) integers, the remainder being 10.\n4. \\( \\frac{173}{48} = 3 \\) integers, the remainder being 48.\n\nProblem II. To reduce a mixt number to an improper fraction.\n\nRule. Multiply the integer by the denominator; to the product add the numerator: The sum is the numerator of the improper fraction; and the denominator is the same as before.\n\nExamples.\n\n1. \\( \\frac{54}{8} = 6\\frac{6}{8} \\); for \\( 54 \\times 8 = 432 \\)\n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{c}\n   + 5 \\\\\n   \\hline\n   \\text{Numerator } 437\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n2. \\( \\frac{98}{14} = 7\\frac{10}{14} \\); for \\( 98 \\times 14 = 1372 \\)\n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{c}\n   + 10 \\\\\n   \\hline\n   \\text{Numerator } 1382\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n\nProblem III. To reduce a whole number to a fraction of a given denominator.\n\nRule. Multiply the whole number by the given denominator; and place the product by way of numerator over the given denominator.\n\nExamples.\n\n1. Reduce 9 to a fraction whose denominator is 5.\n   \\[ 9 \\times 5 = 45; \\text{ so the fraction is } \\frac{45}{5}. \\]\n2. Reduce 36 to a fraction whose denominator is 4.\n   \\[ 36 \\times 4 = 144; \\text{ so the fraction is } \\frac{144}{4}. \\]\n3. Reduce 8 to a fraction whose denominator is 1.\n   \\[ 8 \\times 1 = 8; \\text{ so the fraction is } \\frac{8}{1}. \\]\n\nThe reason of the rule appears by reversing the operation; for if the numerator be divided by the denominator, it will quot the integer, or whole number.\n\nProblem IV. To reduce a compound fraction to a simple one.\n\nRule. Multiply the numerators continually for the numerator of the simple fraction; and multiply the denominators continually for its denominator.\n\nExamples.\n\nEx. 1. \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) of \\( \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{8}{15} \\).\nEx. 2. \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) of \\( \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{24} \\).\n\nCor. From this problem may be deduced a method of reducing a fraction of a lesser denomination to a fraction of a greater denomination; namely,\n\nForm a compound fraction, by comparing the given fraction with the superior denominations; and then reduce the compound fraction, to a simple one.\n\nExamples.\n\n1. What fraction of a pound Sterling is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of a penny?\n   \\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ d. is } \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ of } \\frac{1}{12} \\text{ L. } = \\frac{1}{48} \\text{ L. } \\]\n2. What fraction of a C. is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of a pound?\n   \\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ lb. is } \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ of } \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ C. } = \\frac{1}{16} \\text{ C. } \\]\n\nProblem V. To reduce a fraction of a greater denomination to a fraction of a lesser denomination.\n\nRule. Multiply the numerator of the given fraction, as in reduction of integers descending; and the product is the numerator, to be placed over the denominator of the given fraction.\n\nExamples.\n\n1. What fraction of a shilling is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of a pound?\n\nHere, as in reduction descending, multiply the numerator 3 by 20, because 20 shillings make a pound; as under.\n\n\\[ \\frac{3 \\times 20}{4} = \\frac{60}{4} \\text{ shilling. } \\]\n\n2. What fraction of a penny is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ L. } ? \\)\n\n\\[ \\frac{4 \\times 20 \\times 12}{5} = \\frac{960}{5} \\text{ d. } \\]\n\nThe reason of this rule will appear by observing, that every fraction may be considered in two views. Thus, \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) may either be considered as expressing three fourths of one unit, or as denoting the fourth part of three units.\n\nNow, if the unit be a pound Sterling, the fraction, in the latter view, will denote the fourth part of three pounds; and by reducing the numerator \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) to shillings, we have \\( \\frac{60}{4} \\text{ s. } \\); and again reducing 60 shillings to pence, we have \\( \\frac{720}{4} \\text{ d. } \\) equal to \\( \\frac{60}{4} \\text{ s. } \\), or to \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\text{ L. } \\).\n\nProblem VI. To find the value of a fraction.\n\nRule. Reduce the numerator to the next inferior denomination; divide by the denominator; and the quot, if nothing remain, is the value complete.\n\nIf there be any remainder, it is the numerator of a fraction whose denominator is the divisor. This fraction may either be annexed to the quotient, or reduced to value, if there be any lower denomination.\n\nExamples.\n**ARITHMETIC**\n\n**Example.** What is the value of \\( \\frac{3}{20} \\) L.?\n\nHere consider \\( \\frac{3}{20} \\) L. as expressing the fourth part of three pounds Sterling; so reduce L. 3, the numerator, to shillings, and divide by the denominator 4; and as nothing remains, the quot, viz. 15 shillings, is the value complete.\n\nThe reason of this rule is the same with that in the preceding problem. It is by the practice of this problem that remainders in the rule of three are reduced to value.\n\n**Prob. VII.** To reduce a fraction to its lowest terms.\n\n**Rule.** Divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor; the two quots make the new fraction.\n\nThe greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator of a fraction is found by the following\n\n**Rule.** Divide the greater of these two numbers by the lesser; and again divide the divisor by the remainder; and so on, continually, till 0 remains. The last divisor is their greatest common divisor.\n\n**Example.** Reduce \\( \\frac{784}{952} \\) to its lowest terms.\n\nFirst find the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator, as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n784 \\\\\n672 \\\\\n112 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nGreatest common divisor = 112\n\nThen proceed to reduce the given fraction to its lowest terms, by dividing both numerator and denominator by 56, the greatest common divisor.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n56 \\\\\n224 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nSo \\( \\frac{784}{952} = \\frac{14}{17} \\).\n\n**Prob. VIII.** To reduce fractions of different denominators to a common denominator.\n\n**Rule.** Multiply the denominators continually for the common denominator; and multiply each numerator into all the denominators, except its own, for the several numerators.\n\n**Examples.**\n\nReduce \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) and \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) to a common denominator.\n\n\\( 4 \\times 5 = 20 \\), the common denominator.\n\n\\( 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\), the first numerator.\n\n\\( 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\), the second numerator.\n\nSo the new fractions are \\( \\frac{15}{20} \\) and \\( \\frac{16}{20} \\).\n\nWhen the denominator of one fraction happens to be an aliquot part of the denominator of another fraction, the former may be reduced to the same denominator with the latter, by multiplying both its numerator and denominator by the number which denotes how often the lesser denominator is contained in the greater.\n\nThus, \\( \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{6}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{7}{8} \\).\n\nHere 3 is contained in 12 four times; so multiply both 2 and 3 by 4, and you have \\( \\frac{6}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{7}{8} \\).\n\nAgain, \\( \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{2}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{4}{8} \\).\n\nSometimes too, the fraction that has the greater denominator may, in like manner, be reduced to the same denominator with that which has the lesser, by division.\n\nThus, \\( \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{6}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{7}{8} \\).\n\nAnd \\( \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{2}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{4}{8} \\).\n\nThe reason of the above rule for reducing fractions to a common denominator is evident from Corollary II.; for both numerator and denominator of every fraction are multiplied by the same number, or by the same numbers.\n\nAfter fractions are reduced to a common denominator, they may frequently be reduced to lower terms, by dividing all the numerators, and also the common denominator, by any divisor that leaves no remainder, or by cutting off an equal number of ciphers from both.\n\n**Addition of Vulgar Fractions.**\n\n**Rule I.** If the given fractions have all the same denominator, add the numerators, and place the sum over the denominator.\n\n**Ex. 1.** What is the sum of \\( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\)? Ans. \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n**2.** What is the sum of \\( \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} \\)? Ans. \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\), by Prob. VII.\n\n**Rule II.** If the given fractions have different denominators, reduce them to a common denominator, by Prob. VIII. then add the numerators, and place the sum over the common denominator.\n\n**Ex.** What is the sum of \\( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} \\)?\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{3}{6} + \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{5}{6} \\).\n\n**Rule III.** If mixt numbers be given, or if mixt numbers and fractions be given, reduce the mixt numbers to improper fractions, by Prob. II.; then reduce the fractions to a common denominator, by Prob. VIII. and add the numerators.\n\n**Ex.** What is the sum of \\( 7\\frac{1}{4} + 5\\frac{1}{2} \\)?\n\n\\( 7\\frac{1}{4} + 5\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{31}{4} + \\frac{11}{2} \\), by Prob.

I.\n\nWhen mixt numbers, or mixt numbers and fractions, are given, you may, with greater expedition, work by the following rule, viz. reduce only the fractions to a common denominator, and add the sum of the fractions.\nto the integers. The above example wrought in this manner follows.\n\nEx. What is the sum of \\( \\frac{7}{4} + \\frac{5}{2} \\)?\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{10}{4} = \\frac{13}{4}\n\\]\n\nand \\( 7 + 5 + 1 = 13 \\).\n\nRule IV.

VIII.}\n\\]\n\nand \\( \\frac{12}{28} + \\frac{7}{28} = \\frac{19}{28} = \\frac{1}{2}, \\text{ by Prob. I.}\n\\)\n\nRule V. If the given fractions be of different denominations, first reduce them to the same denomination, by Cor. of Prob. IV. or by Prob. V.; then reduce the fractions, now of one denomination, to a common denominator, by Prob. VII. and add the numerators; or reduce each of the given fractions separately to value, by Prob.

But when a fraction is subtracted from an integer, for the unit borrowed, take 1 from the given integer, and prefix the remainder to the fractional part of the answer.\n\nEx. 1. From 14 subtract \\( \\frac{7}{4} \\).\n\nHere say, \\( 5 - 3 = 2; \\) so \\( \\frac{2}{4} \\) is the fractional part of the answer: Then say, 1 borrowed and 7 make 8, and 8 subtracted from 14 leaves 6; which prefix to the fractional part: So the difference or answer is \\( 6 \\frac{2}{4} \\).\n\nEx. 2.

Multiply the numerators for the numerator of the product, and multiply the denominators for its denominator.\n\nExamples:\n1. \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{8}{15} \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{15}{24} = \\frac{5}{8} \\)\n\nNote 1. If any number be multiplied by a proper fraction, the product will be less than the multiplicand; for multiplication is the taking of the multiplicand as often as the multiplier contains unity; and consequently, if the multiplier be greater than unity, the product will be greater than the multiplicand; if the multiplier be unity, the product will be equal to the multiplicand; and if the multiplier be less than unity, the product will, in the same proportion, be less than the multiplicand. Thus, supposing the multiplier to be \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) or \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\), the product, in this case, will be equal to one half or to one third of the multiplicand.\n\n2. Mixt numbers may be multiplied without reducing them to improper fractions, by working as in the margin; where, first multiply the integral parts, viz. 54 by 24; then multiply the integral parts cross-ways into their alternate fractions, viz. \\( \\frac{54}{24} \\times \\frac{24}{54} \\) and the product set down; in like manner multiply 24 by \\( \\frac{27}{6} \\); and the product likewise set down; then add; and to the sum annex \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), the product of the two fractions.\n\n3. In multiplying a fraction by an integer, you have only to multiply the numerator by the integer, the putting one for the denominator being only matter of form. And to multiply a fraction by its denominator is to take away the denominator, the product being an integer, the same with, or equal to the numerator. Thus, \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\times 8 = 7 \\). For \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\times \\frac{8}{1} = \\frac{7}{8} \\times \\frac{8}{1} = 7 \\).\n\n4. If the numerators and denominators of two equal fractions be multiplied cross-ways, the products will be equal. Thus, if \\( \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{4}{3} \\), then will \\( 3 \\times 12 = 9 \\times 4 \\); for multiplying both by 9, we have \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{9}{4} \\); and multiplying these by 12, we have \\( 3 \\times 12 = 9 \\times 4 \\). Hence, if four numbers be proportional, the product of the extremes will be equal to the product of the means: for if \\( \\frac{3}{4} : \\frac{9}{4} :: \\frac{4}{12} : \\frac{12}{9} \\), then \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{12}{9} = \\frac{9}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{12} \\); and it has been proved, that \\( 3 \\times 12 = 9 \\times 4 \\). Therefore, if, of four proportional numbers, any three be given, the fourth may easily be found, viz. when one of the extremes is sought, divide the product of the means by the given extreme; and when one of the means is sought, divide the product of the extremes by the given mean.\n\n5. In multiplying fractions, equal factors above and below may be divided or dropped. Thus, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{5} \\); and dropping the factors 2, 3, 4, both above and below, the product is \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\). In like manner, to facilitate an operation, a factor above and another below may be divided by the same number: Thus, \\( \\frac{6}{7} \\times \\frac{5}{7} = \\frac{30}{49} = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{6}{7} \\). Or we may exchange one numerator for another: Thus, \\( \\frac{6}{7} \\times \\frac{5}{7} = \\frac{6}{7} \\times \\frac{5}{7} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\n6. To take any part of a given number, is to multiply the said number by the fraction. Thus, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 320 \\) is found thus, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{320}{1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{320}{1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{320}{1} = 200 \\). In like manner, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 45 \\frac{1}{2} \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{45}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{45}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{45}{2} = 30 \\frac{1}{2} \\). Hence, to reduce a compound fraction to a simple one, is to multiply the parts of it into one another.\n\n7. If a multiplicand of two or more denominations be given to be multiplied by a fraction, reduce the higher part or parts of the multiplicand to the lowest species, and then multiply. Thus, to multiply 8 l. 10 s. by \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), say, 8 l. = 8 x 20 s. = 160 s., and 10 s. + 10 s. = 170 s. = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), and \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{170}{2} = \\frac{170}{4} = 113 \\frac{1}{2} \\). Or, without reducing, you may multiply the given multiplicand by the numerator of the fraction, and divide the product by the denominator.\n\nExamples:\n1. Multiply \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) by \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). Prod. \\( \\frac{4}{9} \\).\n2. Multiply \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\) by \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\). Prod. \\( \\frac{49}{64} \\).\n3. Multiply \\( \\frac{8}{9} \\) by \\( \\frac{9}{8} \\). Prod. \\( \\frac{81}{64} \\).\n\nThe reason of the rule may also be shewn thus: \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{9} \\); for \\( \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{4}{9} \\), and \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of \\( \\frac{4}{9} \\) is \\( \\frac{4}{9} \\); and consequently \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of \\( \\frac{4}{9} \\) is \\( \\frac{4}{9} \\).\n\nThe truth of the rule may also be proved thus: Assume two fractions equal to two integers, such as, \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\), and \\( \\frac{5}{2} \\), equal to 2 and 3, and the product of the fractions will be equal to the product of the integers; for \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\times \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{15}{4} = 6 \\), and \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\).\n\nDivision of Vulgar Fractions.\n\nIn division of fractions, if a mixt number be given, reduce it to an improper fraction; if an integer be given, put an unit for its denominator; if a compound fraction be given, reduce it to a simple one, and then work by the following\n\nRule. Multiply cross-ways; viz. the numerator of the divisor into the denominator of the dividend, for the denominator of the quot; and the denominator of the divisor into the numerator of the dividend, for the numerator of the quot.\n\nExamples:\n1. \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\div \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{10}{12} = \\frac{5}{6} \\).\n2. \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\div \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{15}{16} \\).\n3. \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\div \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{16}{25} \\).\n\nNote:\nNote 1. Instead of working division of fractions as taught above, you may invert the divisor, and then multiply it into the dividend. Thus, in Example 1 instead \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{20} - 1 \\times \\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{8} \\).\n\n2. If any number be divided by a proper fraction, the quot will be greater than the dividend; for in division the quot shews how often the divisor is contained in the dividend; and consequently if the divisor be greater than unity, the quot will be less than the dividend; if the divisor be unity, the quot will be equal to the dividend; and if the divisor be less than unity, the quot will, in the same proportion, be greater than the dividend. Thus, supposing the divisor to be \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\), or \\( \\frac{7}{5} \\), the quot in this case will be double or triple of the dividend.\n\n3. To divide a fraction by an integer, is only to multiply the integer into the denominator of the fraction, the numerator being continued. Thus, \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\div 4 = \\frac{7}{16} \\).\n\n4. A mixt number may sometimes be divided by an integer, with more ease, in the following manner. Divide the integral part of the mixt number by the given integer: and if there be no remainder, divide likewise the fraction of the mixt number by the given integer, and annex the quot to the integral quot formerly found. But if, in dividing the integral part, there happen to be a remainder, prefix this remainder to the fraction for a new mixt number; which reduce to an improper fraction: then divide the improper fraction by the given integer, and annex the quot to the integral quot formerly found. Thus, if it be required to divide \\( 1 \\frac{5}{6} \\) by 8, say, \\( 8 \\times 1 \\), and 7 remains; which 7, prefixed to the fraction, gives \\( 7 \\times \\frac{1}{8} \\) for a new mixt number; and this, reduced to an improper fraction, is \\( \\frac{1}{9} \\), and \\( 8 \\times \\frac{7}{8} = 2 \\); so the complete quot is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\n5. If the factors of the numerator and denominator of the quot, instead of being actually multiplied, be only connected with the sign of multiplication, it will be easy to drop such factors, above and below, as happen to be the same, thus: \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{4}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{4}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{4}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4} \\).\n\nOr, a factor above and below may be divided by the same number thus: \\( \\frac{6}{5} \\times \\frac{7}{12} - \\frac{7}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{7}{5} \\). Or the factors of the numerator of the quot may be exchanged, thus: \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{3}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{3}{2} \\).\n\n6. To divide an integer by a fraction, is to divide the product of the denominator and integer by the numerator, thus: \\( \\frac{8}{4} = \\frac{8}{4} = \\frac{8}{4} = 2 \\).\n\n7. If the divisor and dividend have the same denominator, you have only to divide the numerator of the dividend by the numerator of the divisor, thus: \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\); for \\( \\frac{8}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{8}{5} \\).\n\n8. If a dividend of two or more denominations be given to be divided by a fraction, reduce the higher part or parts of the dividend to the lowest species, and then divide. Thus, to divide 61, 9\u00bd s. by \u00be, say, 61 = \\( 6 \\times 20 \\) = 120; and 120 + 9\u00bd = 1\u00b29\u00bd s. = \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\); and \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{3}{5} \\right) = 19 \\frac{4}{5} \\) s. = 91. 14 s. 7\u00bd d.\n\nOr, Divide the given multiplicand by the numerator of the fraction, and multiply the quot by the denominator.\n\nExample: Divide L. 276 : 16 : 8 among four men, A, B, C, D, so that A, B, C, may have equal shares, and D only two thirds of one of their shares.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{llll}\nL. & r. & d. & L. & r. & d. & L. & r. & d. \\\\\n11) 276 & 16 & 8 & (25 & 3 & 4 \\times 3 = 75 & 10 & A. \\\\\n& & & & & \\times 3 = 75 & 10 & B. \\\\\n& & & & & \\times 3 = 75 & 10 & C. \\\\\n& & & & & \\times 2 = 50 & 6 & 8 D.)\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nProof 276 : 16 : 8\n\nThe reason of the rule will appear by considering, that the method here used is nothing else but the reducing the divisor and dividend to a common denominator, and then dividing the one numerator by the other. Thus, \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\), for reducing the divisor and dividend to a common denominator, we have \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{4}{5} \\).\n\nThe truth of the rule may also be proved by assuming two fractions equal to two integers, such as, \\( \\frac{5}{6} \\) and \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\), equal to 2 and 4, and the quot of the fractions will be equal to the quot of the integers. Thus, \\( \\frac{5}{6} \\times \\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 2 \\), and \\( 2 \\div 4 = 2 \\).\n\nThe Simple Rule of Three in Vulgar Fractions.\n\nThe question is stated as formerly taught in the rule of three. The extremes must be of one denomination, Reduce mixt numbers and integers to improper fractions, compound fractions to simple ones, and then work by the following rule, viz.\n\nMultiply the second and third terms, and divide the product by the first term; that is, multiply the numerator of the first term into the denominators of the second and third, for the denominator of the answer; and multiply the denominator of the first term into the numerators of the second and third, for the numerator of the answer.\n\nI. Direct.\n\nQuest.

X. Rules of Practice.\n\nWhen the first term of a question in the rule of three happens to be unity, the answer may frequently be found more speedily and easily than by a formal stating or working of the rule of three; and the directions to be observed in such operations are called Rules of Practice.\n\nThe rules of practice naturally follow the doctrine of vulgar fractions, the operation being nothing else but a multiplying the number whose price is required, by such a fraction of a pound, of a shilling, or of a penny, as denotes the rate or price of one.\n\nThus, if the price of 24 yards, at 6s. 8d. per yard, be demanded, the answer is found by multiplying 24 by \\( \\frac{6}{2} \\), the fraction of a pound equivalent to 6s. 8d., viz.\n\n\\( \\frac{6}{2} \\times \\frac{6}{2} = \\frac{6}{2} = 8l. \\)\n\nHence, it is obvious, that to multiply a number by a fraction whose numerator is unity, is to divide the said number by the denominator of the fraction. But if the numerator of the fraction be not unity, you must first multiply the given number by the numerator, and then divide the product by the denominator. Thus, if the rate be 13s. 4d., the price of 24 yards is found by saying,\n\n\\( \\frac{13}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{2} = \\frac{13}{2} = 16l. \\); or take \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of the given number twice.\n\nWhen the fraction denoting the rate happens to be compound, the product or answer is found by dividing the given number by one of the denominators of the compound fraction, the quot by another, and the next quot by the third, &c. Thus, if the rate be 2 farthings \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) l., the price of 1440 yards is found by saying, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} = 720 \\), and \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} = 60 \\), and \\( \\frac{1}{2} = 3l. \\).\n\nWhen the rate is expressed by two or more simple fractions, connected with the sign \\( + \\), the product or answer is found by dividing the given number successively by the several denominators, and then adding the quot. Thus, if the rate be \\( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\), the price of 80 yards is found by saying, \\( \\frac{1}{2} = 3 \\), and \\( \\frac{1}{2} = 4 \\), and \\( \\frac{1}{2} = 12l. \\).\n\nThe fractions equivalent to any number of farthings under 4, to any number of pence under 12, and to any number of shillings under 20, are exhibited in the following tables.\n\n| Table I. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Farthings. | of a penny. | of a shilling. | of a pound. |\n| 1 | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) |\n| 2 | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) |\n| 3 | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) |\n\n| Table II. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Pen. of a shilling. | s.d. of a pound. | s. d. of a pound. |\n| 1 | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) |\n| 2 | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) |\n| 3 | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) |\n| 4 | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) |\n| 5 | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) |\n| 6 | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) |\n| 7 | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) |\n| 8 | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) |\n| 9 | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) |\n| 10 | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) |\n| 11 | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) |\n\nThe fractions in Table II. become compound fractions of a pound, by annexing (of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)) to each of them. Thus, 1d. is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) l.; and 5d. is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) + \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) l., &c.\n\nThe variety that occurs in the rules of practice arises chiefly from the different rates, or prices, of one thing, as a yard, a pound, an ounce, &c. and may be reduced to the eight cases following, viz.\n\n1. Farthings under four.\n2. Pence under twelve.\n3. Pence and farthings.\n4. Shillings under twenty.\n5. Shillings, pence, and farthings.\n6. Pounds.\n7. Pounds, shillings, pence, and farthings.\n8. The given number may consist of integers and parts.\n\nCase I. When the rate is farthings, under four.\n\nRule. Divide the given number by the denominator of the fraction denoting the rate, as contained in Tab. I. viz. if the rate be 1 or 2 farthings, divide by 4 or 2, the quot will be pence; and the remainder, in dividing by 4, will be farthings, and in dividing by 2, it will be halfpenny; then divide the pence by 12, the quot will be shillings, and the remainder pence. Lastly, divide the shillings by 20, the quot will be pounds, and the remainder shillings. But if the rate is 3 farthings, first multiply the given number by the numerator 3, and then divide as above directed.\n\n| Ex. 1. | Ex. 2. |\n| --- | --- |\n| \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4859 \\), at 1 f. | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 8347 \\), at 2 f. |\n| \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1214 = 3 \\) f. | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4173 = \\frac{1}{2} \\) d. |\n| \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 = 2 \\) d. | \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 = 1 \\) 7\u20149 d. |\n| L.5 1 2 3 | L.17 7 9 2 |\n\nCase II. When the rate is pence, under twelve.\n\nRule. Divide the given number by the denominator of the fraction denoting the rate, as contained in Table II. and you have the answer in shillings; which reduce into pounds, by dividing by 20.\nNote, The remainders at the first division in the above examples are the same with the rate. Thus, in Ex. 1. every remainder is 1 d.\n\nCase III. When the rate is pence and farthings.\n\nRule. The pence must be some aliquot part of a shilling; and, at the same time, the farthings some aliquot part of the pence; and if they be not so given, divide the pence into two or more such parts, so as the farthings may be some aliquot part of the lowest division of the pence. Then, beginning with the highest division of the pence, divide by the denominators of the fractions denoting the aliquot parts.\n\n| Ex. 1. | Ex. 2. |\n|-------|-------|\n| 532, at 1\u00bd d. | 1753, at 1\u00bd d. |\n| 44\u20144 | 146\u20141 |\n| 11\u20141 | 73\u20140\u00bd |\n| 55\u20145 | 219\u20141\u00bd |\n\nExplication.\n\nIn Ex. 1. work first for 1 d.; which being \u00bc s., divide the given number by the denominator 12, and the quotient is shillings, and the remainder pence; then, because 1 farthing is \u00bc d., divide the former quotient by 4, and the sum of the quotients is the price in shillings; which divide by 20.\n\nIn Ex. 2. the rate 1\u00bd d. being an aliquot part of a shilling, the second method is shorter and better than the first.\n\nCase IV. When the rate is shillings under twenty.\n\nRule. Multiply the given number by the numerator of the fractions contained in Tab. III. and divide the product by the denominators. Or, instead of this general rule, take the two particular ones following.\n\n1. If the rate be an even number of shillings, multiply the given number by half the number of shillings in the rate, always doubling the right-hand figure of the product for shillings, and the rest are pounds.\n\n2. If the rate be an odd number of shillings, work for the next lesser even number of shillings, as above; and for the odd shilling take \u00bd of the given number.\n\nExample I. When the rate is an even number of shillings.\n\n| Ex. 1. | Ex. 2. |\n|-------|-------|\n| 436, at 2 s. | 127, at 4 s. |\n| 1 | 2 |\n| L. 43, 12 s. | L. 25, 8 s. |\n\n2. When the rate is an odd number of shillings.\n\n| Ex. 1. | Ex. 2. |\n|-------|-------|\n| 635, at 1 s. | 422, at 3 s. |\n| L. 31, 15 s. | L. 63, 6 s. |\n\nNote 1. The reason of multiplying by half the number of shillings in the rate will appear by considering, that these are the numerators of the fractions denoting the rate. Thus, 2 s. is \u00bc l., and 4 s. is \u00bd l., and 6 s. is \u00be l., and each unit in the product is two shillings. The division by the denominator 10 is performed by cutting off the right-hand figure of the product, and the figure so cut off is the remainder; and as each unit in the remainder is two shillings, the double of them is the remainder in shillings.\n\nNote 2. From Ex. 1. we may learn, that when the rate is 2 s., the price is found by doubling the right-hand figure of the given number for shillings, and the other figure or figures are pounds.\n\nNote 3. In Ex. 2. the price may also be had by taking \u00bd of the given number; and in this way every remainder will be 4 s.\n\nNote 4. By reversing the operation, from the price and any even rate given, we may readily find the quantity of goods, viz.

XI. Of Decimals.\n\nI. Notation.\n\nA Fraction having 10, 100, 1000, or unity with any number of ciphers annexed to it, for a denominator, is called a decimal fraction; such as, $\\frac{7}{10}$, $\\frac{25}{100}$, $\\frac{3}{1000}$.\n\nIn decimal fractions, as in vulgar, the denominator shews into how many parts the unit or integer is divided, and the numerator shews how many of these parts the fraction contains. Thus, if the fraction be $\\frac{9}{10}$, the unit is divided into ten equal parts, and the fraction contains nine of these parts; and consequently, if the unit or integer be a pound Sterling, the value of such a fraction is eighteen shillings.\n\nWe may conceive the denominator of a decimal fraction to be formed by dividing the unit into 10 equal parts, and each of these parts into 10 other equal parts, each of these again into 10 other equal parts, and so on, as far as necessary; and hence a decimal fraction will always be so many tenths, or so many tenths of $\\frac{1}{10}$, or so many tenths of $\\frac{1}{10}$ of $\\frac{1}{10}$, &c.; and by reducing the compound fraction to a simple one, we have the decimal. Thus, $\\frac{8}{10}$ of $\\frac{1}{10}$ of $\\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{1}{1000}$.\nOr we may conceive the denominator of a decimal to be formed by the continual multiplication of unity into 10, as often as there are ciphers in it. Thus, \\(1 \\times 10 = 10\\), and \\(1 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 100\\), and \\(1 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 1000\\), &c. And because the fractions \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\), \\(\\frac{1}{100}\\), \\(\\frac{1}{1000}\\), &c., have the highest numerators possible, it is plain, that the number of figures or places in the numerator of a decimal can never exceed the number of ciphers in the denominator.\n\nIt is usual to write down only the numerator of a decimal fraction, omitting the denominator; and when the numerator has the same number of figures or places as the denominator has ciphers, it is done by writing down the figures of the numerator, and prefixing a point, to distinguish them from a whole number. So \\(\\frac{7}{25}\\) is written thus, .25. The point thus prefixed is called the decimal point.\n\nBut when the numerator has not so many figures or places as there are ciphers in the denominator, the defect is supplied by prefixing a cipher for every figure wanting, and then placing the decimal point on the left. So \\(\\frac{3}{25}\\) is written thus, .03; and \\(\\frac{7}{1000}\\) thus, .007; and \\(\\frac{3}{10000}\\) thus, .0003.\n\nFrom this manner of notation, it is easy to read a decimal, or to know its denominator, viz., imagine 1 to stand under the decimal point, and a cipher under every decimal place. Thus, .9 is \\(\\frac{9}{10}\\), and .48 is \\(\\frac{48}{100}\\), and .05 is \\(\\frac{5}{100}\\), and .007 is \\(\\frac{7}{1000}\\), and .00036 is \\(\\frac{36}{10000}\\).\n\nHence it is plain, that decimals, like integers, decrease from the left to the right, and increase from the right to the left, in a decuple proportion. On the contrary, any decimal figure, by being removed one place toward the left, becomes ten times greater.\n\nAn integer, by annexing ciphers, is raised to higher places on the left, and may by this means have its value increased to infinity. On the other hand, a decimal, by prefixing ciphers, is depressed to lower places on the right, and may by this means have its value diminished to infinity.\n\nCiphers annexed to decimals do not change the value of the decimals. Thus, .50 = 5, and .500 = 5, for .50 = \\(\\frac{50}{100} = \\frac{5}{10} = .5\\); and \\(\\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{5}{100} = .05\\).\n\nDecimals may be resolved into constituent parts, and the parts may be read, separately, thus, .847 = 8 + .04 + .007 = \\(\\frac{8}{10} + \\frac{4}{100} + \\frac{7}{1000}\\).\n\nIn decimals the figure next the point, being the first decimal place, is sometimes called primes, and the second figure from the point is called seconds, the next thirds, &c. Thus, in .875 the figure 8 is primes, 7 is seconds, and 5 is thirds.\n\nFrom this brief account of the nature of decimals, it follows, that the manner of operation in decimals will be the same as in whole numbers; and also, that the same number may be differently expressed, according as the integer is chosen. Thus, the time since our Saviour's birth may be written thus, 1769; or thus, 1769; or thus, 1769; or thus, 1769, according as one year, a decad, a century, a chilad, or myriad, is used as the integer. Hence arises the superior excellency of decimal arithmetic, above every other sort of numerical computation; as will appear in the sequel.\n\nII. Reduction of Decimals.\n\nProb. I. To reduce a vulgar fraction to a decimal.\n\nRule. To the numerator of the vulgar fraction affix a point or comma, then annex a competent number of ciphers, and divide by the denominator; the quot is the numerator of the decimal, and the cyphers annexed show the number of decimal places.\n\nExam. I. Reduce \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) to a decimal?\n\nHere to the numerator 1 annex one cipher, and dividing by the denominator 2, the quot is 5, and 0 remains; and because a single cipher only was annexed to the numerator, the decimal numerator will consist but of one figure, namely 5; to which, therefore, prefix the decimal point. So \\(\\frac{1}{2} = .5\\).\n\nHence appears the reason of the rule; namely, \\(2 : 1 :: 10 : 5\\); that is, as the vulgar denominator to the vulgar numerator, so is the decimal denominator to the decimal numerator.\n\nExam. II. Reduce \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) to a decimal.\n\nTo the numerator 3, annex two ciphers; and, dividing by the denominator, the quot gives 75 for the numerator of the decimals, two ciphers having been annexed. So \\(\\frac{3}{4} = .75\\).\n\nThough ciphers may be annexed at pleasure, yet it is the ciphers used that determine the number of decimal places in the quot; and at first it is sufficient to annex so many as serve to complete the first dividend, leaving room to annex more as you proceed in the operation; or rather annex the other ciphers to the remainders, without giving them a place in the dividend.\n\nThe first dividend also shows whether ciphers ought to be prefixed to the quot, and how many. Thus, if the first dividend take in only one of the annexed ciphers, the figure put in the quot is primes, and no cipher to be prefixed. If the first dividend comprehend two of the annexed ciphers, the figure put in the quot is seconds, and one cipher must be prefixed. If the first dividend comprehend three of the annexed ciphers, the figure put in the quot is thirds, and two ciphers must be prefixed, &c. Hence, in reducing a vulgar fraction to a decimal, the natural and easy way is, to place first the decimal point in the quot, and after it a cipher or ciphers, or the quotient-figure, as the first dividend directs.\n\nIn reducing a vulgar fraction to a decimal, if 0 at last remains, as in all the above examples, the decimal is precisely equal to the vulgar fraction, and is called a finite or terminat decimal.\n\nIn finite decimals, the denominator is always some aliquot part of the numerator increased by annexing ciphers; and such decimals take their rise from vulgar fractions whose denominator is 2 or 5, or some power of 2 or\n2 or 5, or the product of some of their powers. See Chap. XII. and Algebra, Chap. III.\n\nThe powers of numbers are sometimes expressed by indices or exponents placed at the corners of the numbers. Thus, $2^3$ signifies the second power of 2, and $5^3$ signifies the third power of 5; and $10^4$ signifies the fourth power of 10, etc. The index of the root or first power is seldom expressed.\n\nAny power of 2 multiplied into the like power of 5 gives a product equal to the same power of 10; as appears from the following specimen of the powers of 2, 5, and 10.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c}\n2^1 & 2^2 & 2^3 \\\\\n\\hline\n2 & 4 & 8 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c}\n5^1 & 5^2 & 5^3 \\\\\n\\hline\n5 & 25 & 125 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c}\n10^1 & 10^2 & 10^3 \\\\\n\\hline\n10 & 100 & 1000 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe product of two different powers of 2 and 5, is equal to the product that will arise by raising 10 to the power denoted by the lesser given index, and then multiplying this power of 10 into that power of the other number which is denoted by the difference of the two given exponents. Thus,\n\n\\[\n2^6 \\times 5^3 = 64 \\times 125 = 10^3 \\times 2^4 = 100 \\times 16 = 1600\n\\]\n\nFrom these remarks it is easy to perceive, that 2 or 5, or any of their powers, or product of their powers, will measure 10 or its powers, viz. 100, 1000, etc., or their multiples, such as, 20, 200, 2000, etc., 30, 300, 3000, etc.; and such every numerator becomes by having ciphers annexed; and therefore 2 or 5, or their powers, or product of their powers, used as a denominator, will divide any numerator with a competent number of ciphers annexed, and leave no remainder; and consequently the decimal thence resulting will be finite.\n\nIf the numerator of the vulgar fraction be unity, and the denominator any single power of 2 or 5, there will be as many decimal places in the quoit as there are units in the index of the given power. Thus, $16 = 2^4$ gives a decimal of four places, viz. $\\frac{1}{16} = .0625$; and, $125 = 5^3$ gives a decimal of three places, viz. $\\frac{1}{125} = .008$.\n\nWhen the denominator is the product of like powers of 2 and 5; in this case, such a product being equal to the like power of 10, and any power of 10 being equal to 1, with as many ciphers annexed as there are units in the index, it follows, that there will still be as many decimal places in the quoit as there are units in the index, either of 2, of 5, or 10. Thus, $8 \\times 125 = 2^3 \\times 5^3 = 10^3 = 1000$, gives a decimal of three places, viz. $\\frac{1}{1000} = .001$.\n\nWhen the denominator is the product of different powers of 2 or 5, find what power of 10, and what power of 2 or 5, upon being multiplied, will give the same product, as is taught above; and the sum of the indices shews the number of decimal places; thus,\n\n\\[\n2^6 \\times 5^1 = 10^2 \\times 4^1; \\text{and the sum of the indices, } 2 + 4 = 6, \\text{ gives the number of decimal places, viz. } \\frac{1}{1000} = .000625.\n\\]\n\nAnd, in general, to find what number of decimal places any such vulgar fraction will give, divide the denominator by 2, 5, or 10, till the last quotient be 1, and the remainder 0; and the number of divisors shews the number of decimal places. Thus, $\\frac{1}{10}$ gives a decimal of four places; for $2)16(8(4(2(1). And $\\frac{1}{25}$ gives a decimal of three places; for $5)125(25(5(1). And $\\frac{1}{100}$ gives a decimal of three places; for $10)1000(10(10)$.\n\nIf the denominator of a vulgar fraction be neither 2 nor 5, nor any of their powers, nor product of their powers, such a denominator will not divide the numerator with annexed ciphers without a remainder; and the decimal thence resulting is called infinite, or intermediate.\n\nOf infinite or intermediate decimals, there are two sorts. For some constantly repeat the same figure; and are called repeating decimals, repeaters, or single repeaters. Others repeat a circle of figures; and on that account are called circulating decimals, circulates, or compound repeaters.\n\nExample III. Reduce $\\frac{1}{3}$ to a decimal.\n\nHere the remainder being still the same, viz. 1, the same figure will constantly be repeated in the quoit.\n\nRepeating decimals are of two kinds: viz. some consist only of the repeating figures, such as the examples above; and these are called pure repeaters; others have one or more digits or ciphers betwixt the decimal point and the repeating figure; and these are called mixt repeaters; and the digits or ciphers on the left of the repeating figures are called the finite part of such decimals.\n\nPure repeaters take their rise from vulgar fractions whose denominator is 3, or its multiple 9; and are but few in number.\n\nMixt repeaters derive their origin from vulgar fractions whose denominator is the product of 3 into 2 or 5, or into some of their powers, or product of their powers; and such denominators may be considered as the product of two component parts, whereof one is 2 or 5, or some of their powers, or product of their powers; and hence the finite part. The other component part is 3; and hence the repeating figure.\n\nExample IV. Reduce $\\frac{2}{7}$ to a decimal.\n\nHere the repeater is mixt, the finite part being 2, and the repeating figure 6.\nWe now resolve such denominators into their component parts, and divide the numerator by one of these parts, and then divide the quotient by the other. Thus,\n\n\\[ \\frac{15}{5} = 3 \\times 3. \\]\n\nThe number of places in the finite part of a mixt repeater may be ascertained from the number of units in the index of the powers of 2 or 5.\n\nAnd, universally, to find the number of places in the finite part of such fractions, divide the denominator first by 3, and then divide the quotient by 2, 5, or 10, till the last quotient be 1, and 0 remain; and the number of divisors, excluding 3, shows the number of places in the finite part.\n\nRepeating decimals are usually marked by a dash through the right-hand figure, as in the examples above: But some choose to mark them by a point set over the repeating figure, thus, \\( \\frac{3}{2}, .26 \\). The remainder where the repetition begins is commonly marked with an asterisk.\n\nBecause any quotient multiplied by the divisor reproduces the dividend, it follows, that any decimal multiplied by the denominator of the vulgar fraction from which it resulted, will reproduce the numerator with the annexed ciphers. Thus, if \\( .75 \\), the decimal of \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\), be multiplied by 4, it will reproduce the numerator 3 and the two annexed ciphers.\n\nNow, suppose the given decimal to be a repeater; such as \\( \\frac{3}{7} \\), resulting from the vulgar fraction \\( \\frac{3}{7} \\); if the repeating decimal be multiplied by the denominator 3, it will, by carrying at 9 on the right hand, reproduce the numerator 1 with the annexed cipher. In like manner, if the repeater \\( \\frac{6}{7} \\) be multiplied by 3, it will, by carrying at 9 on the right hand, reproduce the numerator 2 with the annexed cipher. Again, if the repeater \\( \\frac{2}{7} \\) be multiplied by the denominator 9, it will, by carrying at 9 on the right hand, reproduce the numerator 1 with the annexed cipher. And, if the mixt repeater \\( \\frac{2}{7} \\) be multiplied by the denominator 15, it will, by carrying at 9 on the right hand, reproduce the numerator 4 with the two annexed ciphers.\n\nFrom these remarks we may conclude, that the right-hand figure of every repeating decimal is ninth-parts: and the same truth may be evinced by resolving the decimal into its constituent parts, in the following manner.\n\nThe vulgar fraction \\( \\frac{3}{7} \\) reduced to a decimal gives \\( \\frac{3}{7} \\), &c.; and this repeater reduced into decimal constituent parts, becomes \\( \\frac{3}{7} + \\frac{3}{7} + \\frac{3}{7} + \\ldots \\) to infinity. But if we esteem the right-hand figure to be ninth-parts, we have \\( \\frac{3}{7} + \\frac{3}{7} \\) of \\( \\frac{3}{7} + \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{3}{7} + \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{3}{7} \\), the given vulgar fraction. And as the vulgar fraction \\( \\frac{3}{7} \\) gives \\( \\frac{3}{7} \\), so \\( \\frac{3}{7} \\) gives \\( \\frac{3}{7} \\); that is, \\( \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{3}{7} = 1 \\). And, universally, a series of nines infinitely continued is equal to unity in the place on the left hand; thus, \\( \\frac{9}{9} = 1 \\); and \\( \\frac{99}{99} = 1 \\); and \\( \\frac{999}{999} = 1 \\), and \\( \\frac{9999}{9999} = 1 \\).\n\nHence may be ascertained the value of an infinite series decreasing in a decuple proportion. Thus, \\( \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{100} + \\frac{1}{1000} + \\ldots \\), &c., \\( \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{1}{10} \\). And \\( \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{100} + \\frac{1}{1000} + \\ldots \\), &c., \\( \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{1}{10} \\).\n\nIf the denominator of a vulgar fraction be neither 2 nor 5, nor any power of 2 or 5, nor any product of their powers; nor 3, nor 9, nor any product of 3 into 2 or 5, or into some of their powers, or product of their powers, the decimal resulting from such a vulgar fraction will circulate.\n\nCirculates, like repeaters, are of two sorts; viz. pure and mixt. A pure circulate consists of the figures of the circle only; as .09, 09, &c. or 18, 18, &c. A mixt circulate has a finite part betwixt the decimal point and the figure that begins the circle; as .09, 45, 45, &c.; or .32, 142857, 142857, &c. Some chuse to distinguish the finite part from the circle, and one circle from another, by a comma, as above. Others dash the first and last figure of the circle. It is likewise usual to mark the remainder where the new circle begins, by affixing an asterisk.\n\n**Examp. V.** Reduce \\( \\frac{1}{11} \\) to a decimal.\n\nThe denominator 11 gives a pure \\( \\frac{1}{11} \\) circle of two figures,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\n\\frac{1}{11} & = & .09, 09, \\\\\n\\frac{2}{11} & = & .18, 18, \\\\\n\\frac{3}{11} & = & .27, 27, \\\\\n\\frac{4}{11} & = & .36, 36, \\\\\n\\frac{5}{11} & = & .45, 45, \\\\\n\\frac{6}{11} & = & .54, 54, \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nIt is easy to perceive, that if any of the vulgar fractions in the above specimen have both its numerator and denominator multiplied by 9, there will arise a new vulgar fraction of the same value, whose numerator will be the figures of the circle, and its denominator the like number of 9's. Thus,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\n\\frac{3}{11} \\times 9 = \\frac{27}{99}, & \\text{and} & \\frac{7}{11} \\times 9 = \\frac{63}{99}. \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nAs the denominator 11, whereof 99 is a multiple, gives a pure circulate of two places, to any denominator, whereof 999, or 9999, or 99999, &c. are multiples, will give a pure circulate of three, four, five, &c. places; that is, of as many places as there are 9's in the multiple. And such denominators are all the prime numbers, except 2, 3, and 5, viz. 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, &c.; also their products into 3, viz. 21, 33, 39, 51, 57, 69, &c. Such too are all the powers of 3, except 3 and 9, viz. 27, 81, 243, 729, 2187, &c.\n\nThe reason is plain: for if any divisor, as 37, divide 999, without a remainder, it will also divide 1000, and leave a remainder of 1, to begin a new circle.\n\nTo find how many places the circle will consist of, divide a competent number of 9's by any of the above denominators, continuing the operation till 0 remain; and the number of 9's used will show the number of places.\nThus, \\(7\\overline{99999}\\) six places. Thus, \\(27\\overline{955}\\) three places.\n\nThe number of figures in a circle, when some power of 3 is the denominator, may also be found thus: Divide the given denominator by 9, and the number of units in the quotient will be equal to the number of figures in the circle. Thus, \\(9\\overline{27}(3\\) places. Thus, \\(9\\overline{81}(9\\) places, &c.\n\nIf 3 divide a repeater whose repeating figure is not a multiple of 3, the quotient will be a pure circulate of three places. Thus, \\(3\\overline{11}(0.37\\), and \\(3\\overline{555}(0.185\\), and \\(3\\overline{777}(0.259\\).\n\nIf 3 divide a pure circulate, the circle not being a multiple of 3, the quotient will be a pure circulate of thrice as many places as the circle of the dividend. Thus, \\(3\\overline{037}(0.37\\), \\(0\\overline{12345679}\\).\n\nMixt circulates take their rise from fractions whose denominators are the prime numbers 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, &c., multiplied into 2, 5, or 10, or into some of their powers, or product of their powers.\n\n**Exam. VI.** Reduce \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) to a decimal.\n\nThe denominator \\(28 = 7 \\times 2 \\times 2\\), gives a mixt circulate, consisting of the finite part 32, and a circle of six figures or places, whose sum is equal to the product of 9 into half the number of figures; that is, \\(9 \\times 3 = 27\\).\n\nThe number of places, both in the finite part and in the circle, may be ascertained thus: Divide the denominator of the vulgar fraction by 10, 5, or 2, as often as possible, and the number of divisors will show the number of places in the finite part; make the last quotient a divisor, and the dividend any competent number of 9's; continue the operation till 0 remain, and the number of 9's used will be equal to the number of places in the circle. Thus, \\(10\\overline{0300}(0.300\\), and \\(4\\overline{99999}(0.2439\\), and e remains. So you may conclude, that the finite part will consist of three places, and the circle of five.\n\nUniversally, any vulgar fraction being given, we may determine whether the decimal thence resulting will be finite or infinite; and if infinite, whether pure or mixt; with the number of places, &c., in the following manner.\n\nReduce the given vulgar fraction to its lowest terms, then divide the denominator by 10, 5, or 2, as often as possible; and if the last quotient be unity, without any remainder, the decimal is finite, and the number of divisors shows the number of decimal places.\n\nIf the last quotient be 3, or any power of 3, the resulting decimal will be a mixt repeater, the number of whose finite places will be equal to the number of divisors.\n\nIf the last quotient cannot be divided by 2, 5, 10, or 3, the resulting decimal will be a mixt circulate; and the way of finding the number of places, both in the finite part and circle, is taught above.\n\nIf the denominator of the given vulgar fraction can be divided, neither by 2, 5, nor 10, the resulting decimal will be a pure repeater, or a pure circulate, according as the denominator is 3 or 9, or some of the prime numbers, 7, 11, 13, &c.; as has been already explained.\n\nEvery vulgar fraction may be reduced to a decimal, finite or infinite; that is, to a finite decimal, to a repeater, or a circulate. For if the denominator divide the numerator with ciphers annexed, so as to leave no remainder, the resulting decimal is finite. If the remaining figure be always the same, the resulting decimal will be a repeater. If neither of these be the case, yet, because the divisor is a finite number, the remainder at last must either be the same with the numerator of the vulgar fraction, or the same with some preceding remainder, and then a new circle begins; and consequently the resulting decimal will be a circulate.\n\nBecause in circulates the circle runs on sometimes to 16, 18, 22, 28, 81, 243, &c., places, and because, in decimals of every sort, the finite part runs sometimes onto many places, such circulates, or finite parts, may, without any sensible error, be limited at five or six places, and used as finites: for five decimal places, divide the integer into 100,000 equal parts, and all the loss that can be occasioned by such limitation, is less than one hundred thousandth part of the integer. And in most cases, the decimal may be limited at three places, which divide the integer into 1000 equal parts.\n\nCirculates, or finite parts, thus limited, are called approximate decimals; and are sometimes marked with + or \u2014 annexed, according as the right-hand figure is taken less or greater than just: for in limiting the decimal, if you foresee that the succeeding figure of the quotient would be 6 or 7, or any figure above 5, you lessen the error by increasing the right-hand figure of the approximate by unity.\n\n**Prob. II.** To reduce the parts of coin, &c., to decimals.\n\n**Rule.** Convert the given part or parts to a vulgar fraction.\nfraction of the integer, and then reduce the vulgar fraction to a decimal.\n\nEx. 1.

IV. To reduce a decimal to value.\n\nRule. Multiply the given decimal by the number of parts of the next inferior denomination contained in an unit of the integer; and from the product point off so many figures to the right hand as there are places in the given decimal. On the left hand of the point are parts, and on the right a decimal of one of these parts; which decimal must be reduced in the same manner to the next inferior denomination, and from that to the next, and so on to the lowest; the several figures on the left of the points are parts; and if there be still some figure or figures on the right, they are a decimal of the lowest of the parts.\n\nExample 1.\n\nReduce .875 l. to value.\n\n\\[ \\begin{array}{ccc}\nL. & s. & d. \\\\\n.875 & = & 17 \\\\\n& 6 & \\\\\n\\end{array} \\]\n\ns. 17.500\n\nExample 2.\n\nReduce .7691 l. to value.\n\n\\[ \\begin{array}{ccc}\nL. & s. & d. f. \\\\\n.7691 & = & 15 \\\\\n& 4 & 2 \\\\\n\\end{array} \\]\n\ns. 15.3820\n\nThe reason of pointing the product, as the rule directs, is plain. For, in Ex. 1, as 1000 : 875 :: 20 : 17; that is, as the decimal denominator to the decimal numerator, so the vulgar denominator to the vulgar numerator.\n\nIn Ex. 1, the full value of the decimal comes out in parts, the decimal being quite exhausted; but in Ex. 2, besides the parts, there is a decimal of a farthing, viz. .336 f.\n\nThe decimal of a pound Sterling may be reduced to value by inspection, in the following manner.\n\nDouble the figure in the place of primes for shillings; and if the figure in the place of seconds be 5, or exceed 5, reckon 1 shilling more; and rejecting 5 in the second place, the figures in the second and third places are so many farthings, abating 1 for every 25.\n\n\\[ \\begin{array}{ccc}\nL. & s. & d. f. \\\\\n.718 & = & 14 \\\\\n& 4 & 2 \\\\\n\\end{array} \\]\n\nIn Example 1, the figure 7 doubled gives 14 s.; the two following figures 18 are farthings, equal to 4 d. 2 f.\n\nIn Example 2, the figure 7 doubled gives 14 s., and 5 in the place of seconds gives 1 shilling more, in all 15 s.; and the other figure 9 is farthings, viz. 2 d. 1 f.\n\nIn Example 3, the figure 8 in the place of primes, and 5 in the place of seconds, give 17 s.; the remaining figures 44, abating 1, are farthings, viz. 10 d. 3 f.\n\nWhen the figures in the second and third place to be converted into farthings are 25, the answer, by inspection, comes out exact, viz. 24 f. or 6 d.; but in all other cases, the answer, by inspection, is too great, no allowance or correction being made till the convertible number.\nnumber amount to 25, and afford a deduction of 1 farthing complete. Hence, by inspection, we have frequently 1 farthing more than by the common method; but the two methods will agree, or give the same answer, if, from the figures to be turned into farthings, we subtract their 25th part, esteeming the remainder farthings and decimal parts of a farthing.\n\nThus, \\( \\frac{7}{18} = 14s.\\ 4d.\\ 2f.\\) by inspection; but by the common method, and by inspection corrected, the answer comes out 1 farthing less, as follows.\n\n**Common method.**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\nL. \\\\\n\\frac{7}{18} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n**Inspection corrected.**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\nL. \\\\\n\\frac{7}{18} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThat is, \\( \\frac{25}{18} = 18s.\\ 72f.\\)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\ns.\\ 14.360 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\nd.\\ 4.32 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\nf.\\ 1.28 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nAnd \\(17.28 = 4\\)\n\nTo conclude, instead of dividing by 25, we may multiply by .04; and then the exact value of any decimal of a pound Sterling may be found as follows.\n\nFrom the primes and seconds set off the shillings; multiply the remainder by 4, setting the product two places to the right; subtract the product from the first remainder; and from the second remainder point off so many places to the right as there are figures in the first remainder. The number on the left of the point is farthings, and the figures on the right are a decimal of a farthing.\n\n**Example 1.**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\ns.\\ d.\\ f. \\\\\n\\frac{7}{18} = 14\\ 4\\ 1.28 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n**Example 2.**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\ns.\\ d.\\ f. \\\\\n\\frac{7}{691} = 15\\ 4\\ 2.336 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n1 Rem. .18\n\n\\(72 = 18 \\times 4\\)\n\n2 Rem. 17.28\n\n2 Rem. 18.336\n\n**Prob. V.** To reduce a decimal to its primitive vulgar fraction.\n\n**Case I.** When the given decimal is finite.\n\n**Rule.** Divide both numerator and denominator of the given decimal by their greatest common measure; the quotient is the vulgar fraction required.\n\nThus, \\( \\frac{875}{1000} = \\frac{875}{1000} \\)\n\nGreatest common measure \\( \\frac{125}{875} \\)\n\nAnd \\( \\frac{875}{1000} = \\frac{875}{1000} \\)\n\n**Case II.** When the given decimal is a pure repeater, or a pure circulate.\n\n**Rule.** Make the repeating figure, or the figures of the circle, the numerator of the vulgar fraction; the denominator is 9 for the repeating figure, or 9 for every figure of the circle; and then, if occasion require, reduce this fraction to its lowest terms.\n\nThus, \\( \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{1}{3} \\), and \\( \\frac{6}{9} = \\frac{2}{3} \\), and \\( \\frac{5}{9} = \\frac{5}{9} \\).\n\nAgain, \\( \\frac{27}{99} = \\frac{3}{11} \\), and \\( \\frac{714285}{999999} = \\frac{7}{9} \\).\n\n**Case III.** When the given decimal is a mixt repeater, or a mixt circulate.\n\n**Rule.** From the mixt repeater, or mixt circulate, subtract the finite part, and the remainder is the numerator of the vulgar fraction; the denominator is 9 for the repeating figure, or 9 for every figure of the circle, with as many ciphers annexed as there are figures in the finite part.\n\nThus, \\( \\frac{03}{99} = \\frac{1}{33} \\), and \\( \\frac{16}{99} = \\frac{16}{99} \\), and \\( \\frac{083}{999} = \\frac{83}{999} \\).\n\nThe reason of the rule may be shewn thus: Esteem the finite part of the last example an integer, and then the mixt number \\( \\frac{571428}{999999} \\) will be equal to the given circulate. Again, reduce this mixt number to an improper fraction, viz., multiply the integer 3 by the denominator 999999, and to the product add the numerator, as directed in reduction of vulgar fractions.\n\nMultiply the integer 3 into 999999 by the method of multiplying any number by 9, 99, 999, &c. taught in multiplication of integers, and to the product add the numerator, and the sum shall be the numerator of the improper fraction, as in the margin.\n\nNow it is evident that the same numerator will be found, if, in the upper line, instead of the five ciphers, you place the figures of the circle, and from them subtract 3, the finite part.\n\nTo the numerator thus found, the denominator is 999999; and so the vulgar fraction is \\( \\frac{571428}{999999} \\). But we esteemed 3 an integer; whereas, in fact, it is \\( \\frac{3}{999} \\); and so our vulgar fraction will be 100 times greater than it ought to be: to correct this error, we must multiply the denominator by 100, which is done by annexing two ciphers to it; and the true fraction comes out to be \\( \\frac{571428}{999999} \\), as by the rule.\n\nBecause this rule is of great importance, and will often occur in practice, we shall here subjoin another example.\n\nReduce \\( \\frac{0416}{9999} \\) to a vulgar fraction.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\frac{0416}{9999} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nNum. \\( \\frac{375}{9000} \\)\n\nDen. \\( \\frac{4}{9} \\)\n\nIn this manner too may any mixt number, consisting of an integer with a repeater or circulate, be reduced to an improper vulgar fraction; but no ciphers are to be annexed to the denominator for the figures of the integer.\nEx. Reduce 8.3 to an improper vulgar fraction.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{8}{9}\n\\]\n\nNum. \\( \\frac{75}{1} = \\frac{25}{9} = 8\\frac{7}{9}\n\\]\n\nDen. 9\n\nApproximate decimals being imperfect, cannot be exactly reduced back to the vulgar fractions from which they resulted. But if the approximate be completed by annexing to it a vulgar fraction, whereof the remainder of the division is the numerator, and the divisor the denominator, you shall have a mixt number, which you may reduce to an improper vulgar fraction; then to the denominator annex as many ciphers as there are figures in the approximate; and this fraction reduced to its lowest terms, will be the primitive vulgar fraction required.\n\nProb. VI. To reduce unlike circles to others that are similar and conterminous.\n\nSimilar or like circles are such as consist of an equal number of places.\n\nThus, .27, and .09, are similar circles, as consisting of two places each. But .63, and .148, are unlike; the former consisting of two, and the latter of three places.\n\nConterminous circles are such as begin and end at the same distance from the decimal point.\n\nThus, .153846, and .384615, are conterminous; because they both begin at the place of primes, and have an equal number of places. And .0714285, and .714285714285, are conterminous, because they both begin at the place of seconds, and have the same number of places. But .81, and .136, are not conterminous, the former beginning at the place of primes, and the latter at the place of seconds. Again, .63, and .481, are not conterminous, because they have not the same number of places; for circles cannot be conterminous unless they be at the same time similar.\n\nUnlike circles are reduced to similar ones by the following\n\nRule. Find the least multiple of the numbers denoting the number of places in the several given circles, and extend each of the given circles to as many places as there are units in the least multiple.\n\nThus, to reduce the unlike circles .63, .636363, .63, and .148, to similar ones, extend both circles to six places, because 6 is the least multiple of 2 and 3, the number of places in the given circles.\n\nIn a circle any one of the circulating figures may be made the first of the circle. Thus, 7.5925, may be expressed thus, 7.5925925; or thus, 7.5925925; and that without changing its value: consequently a pure circulate may put on the form of a mixt circulate, if one or more figures on the left be set aside for the finite part; thus, .72=7.27, where .72 is the finite part.\n\nThat the value is not changed may be thus demonstrated.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7}{9} = \\frac{7}{9} = \\frac{7}{9} = 0.72\n\\]\n\nHence two or more given circles may be made conterminous, by the following\n\nRule. Set aside by a comma on the left, as many figures as there are places in the longest finite part, and then prolong the several circles to as many places as will make them similar.\n\nEx. To make .5463, and .54636363, .9148, conterminous.\n\nHere, because .54, the longest finite part, consists of two places, set aside .91, in the other circulate, for a finite part, and then prolong both circles to six places, which renders them similar.\n\nIII. Addition of Decimals.\n\nRule I. Place the given decimals so that the points may stand directly under each other, and consequently tenths under tenths, hundredths under hundredths &c.; then, if the given decimals be all finite or approximate, add them as integers, inferring the decimal point directly under the column of points. The figures on the left of the point are integers, and those on the right are a decimal of the integer, consisting of as many places as there are figures in the longest of the given decimals.\n\nThe operation is the same here as in addition of vulgar fractions; for a cipher on the right of a decimal does not change its value: If, therefore, ciphers be annexed, so as to give every decimal the same number of places, as is done in the margin, they will by this means be reduced to a common denominator.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n.75 \\\\\n.85 \\\\\n\\hline\n.160\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nviz. 1000.\n\nNote. If the decimals to be added are of different denominations, first reduce them to one denomination, and then add. The reason is, because like things only can be added or subtracted.\n\nEx. What is the sum of .725l, and .625s.?\n\nHere you may either reduce the decimal of a shilling to that of a pound, or you may reduce the decimal of a pound to that of a shilling.\n\nFirst reduce the decimal of a shilling to that of a pound, by reduction-ascending, viz. divide by 20, as follows.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n20)6.2500(0.3125 \\\\\n\\hline\n725 \\\\\n\\hline\n5625\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nSum .75625 = 15 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\nSecondly, reduce the decimal of a pound to that of a shilling, by reduction-descending; that is, multiply by 20, as follows.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n725l. \\\\\n\\hline\n20 \\\\\n\\hline\n14500 \\\\\n625 \\\\\n\\hline\n15125 sum.\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nd. 1500\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n4 \\\\\n\\hline\nf. 2.0\n\\end{array}\n\\]","sp":468,"ep":484},{"h":"ARITHMETICK","t":"Arithmetick is a science which explains the properties of numbers, and shews the method or art of computing them.\n\nWe have very little intelligence about the origin and invention of arithmetick; but probably it must have taken its rise from the introduction of commerce, and consequently\nquently be of Tyrian invention. From Asia it passed into Egypt, where it was greatly cultivated. From thence it was transmitted to the Greeks, who conveyed it to the Romans with additional improvements. But, from some treatises of the ancients remaining on this subject, it appears that their arithmetick was much inferior to that of the moderns.\n\nNumber, which is the object of arithmetick, is that which answers directly to the question, How many? and is either an unit, or some part or parts of an unit, or a multitude of units.\n\nTo a person having the idea of number in his mind, the following questions naturally occur, viz. 1. How is such a number to be expressed or written? Hence we have Notation. 2. What is the sum of two or more numbers? Hence Addition. 3. What is the difference of two given numbers? Hence Subtraction. 4. What will be the result or product of a given number repeated or taken a certain number of times? Hence Multiplication. 5. How often is one given number contained in another? Hence Division.\n\nThese five, viz. Notation, Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division, are the chief parts, or rather the whole of arithmetic; as every arithmetical operation requires the use of some of them, and nothing but a proper mixture of them is necessary in any operation whatever; and, by an Arabic term, these are called the algorithm.\n\nChap. I. Notation.\n\nNotation is that part of arithmetic which explains the method of writing down, by characters or symbols, any number expressed in words; as also the way of reading or expressing, in words, any number given in characters or symbols. But the first of these is properly notation, and the last is more usually called numeration.\n\nThe things then proper to be comprised in this chapter are, 1. The figural notation. 2. Numeration, or the way of reading numbers. 3. Descriptions of the kinds or species of numbers.\n\nI. Figural Notation.\n\nAn unit, or unity, is that number by which any thing is called one of its kind. It is the first number; and if to it be added another unit, we shall have another number called two; and if to this last another unit be added, we shall have another number called three; and thus, by the continual addition of an unit, there will arise an infinite increase of numbers. On the other hand, if from unity any part be subtracted, and again from that part another part be taken away, and this be done continually, we shall have an infinite decrease of numbers. But though number, with respect to increase and decrease, be infinite, and knows no limits; yet ten figures, variously combined or repeated, are found sufficient to express any number whatsoever. These, with the method of notation by them, were originally invented by some of the eastern nations, probably the Indians; afterwards improved by the Arabians; and at last brought over to Europe, particularly into Britain, betwixt the tenth and twelfth century. From the ten fingers of the hands, on which it hath been usual to compute numbers, figures were called digits. Their form, order, and value, are as follows:\n\n1 One, an unit, or unity, 2 two, 3 three, 4 four, 5 five, 6 six, 7 seven, 8 eight, 9 nine, 0 cipher, nought, null, or nothing. Of these, the first nine, in contradiction to the cipher, are called significant figures.\n\nThe value of the figures now assigned is called their simple value, as being that which they have in themselves, or when they stand alone. But when two or more figures are joined as in a line, the figures then receive also a local value from the place in which they stand, reckoning the order of places from the right-hand towards the left, thus,\n\nA figure standing in the first place has only its simple value; but a figure in the second place has ten times the value it would have in the first place; and a figure in the third place has ten times the value it would have in the second place; and universally a figure in any superior place has ten times the value it would have in the next inferior place.\n\nHence it is plain, that a figure in the first place simply signifies so many units as the figure expresses; but the same figure advanced to the second place will signify so many tens; in the third place, it will signify so many hundreds; in the fourth place, so many thousands; in the fifth place, so many ten-thousands; in the sixth place, so many hundred thousands; and in the seventh place, so many millions, &c. Thus, 7 in the first place, will denote seven units; in the second place, seven tens, or seventy; in the third place, seven hundred; in the fourth place, seven thousand, &c.\n\nEvery three places, reckoning from the right-hand, make a half period; and the right-hand figures of these half-periods are termed units and thousands by turns; the middle figure is always tens, and the left-hand figure always hundreds.\n\nTwo half-periods, or six places, make a full period; and the periods, reckoning from the right-hand towards the left, are titled as follows, viz. the first is the period of units; the second, that of millions; the third is titled bimillions, or billions; the fourth, trimillions, or trillions; the fifth, quadrillions; the sixth, quintillions; the seventh sextillions; the eighth, septillions; the ninth octillions; the tenth, nonillions, &c.\n\nHalf-periods are usually distinguished from one another by a comma, and full periods by a point or colon; as in the following\n\nTable.","sp":447,"ep":448},{"h":"ARKLOW","t":"a sea-port town of Ireland, situated in the county of Wicklow, about thirteen miles south of the city of Wicklow, in 6\u00b0 20' W. long. and 52\u00b0 55' N. lat.","sp":509,"ep":509},{"h":"ARLES","t":"a city of Provence in France, situated on the eastern shore of the river Rhone, in 4\u00b0 45' E. long. and 43\u00b0 32' N. lat.","sp":509,"ep":509},{"h":"ARLEUX","t":"a town of Hainault, in the French Netherlands, situated about six miles south of Douay, in 3\u00b0 E. long. and 50\u00b0 20' N. lat.","sp":509,"ep":509},{"h":"ARLON","t":"a town of the duchy of Luxemburg, on the Austrian Netherlands, situated in 5\u00b0 30' E. long. and 49\u00b0 45' N. lat.","sp":509,"ep":509},{"h":"ARMADA","t":"a Spanish term, signifying a fleet of men of war, as armadilla signifies a squadron.","sp":509,"ep":509},{"h":"ARMADABAT","t":"a very large city of Asia, the metropolis of the kingdom of Guzarat.","sp":509,"ep":509},{"h":"ARMAGH","t":"once a considerable city of Ireland, but now much reduced, situated about thirty miles south of Londonderry, in 6\u00b0 45' W. long. and 54\u00b0 30' N. lat.

Since the cessation of these pilgrimages, no more of this salt is produced there; and, from this deficiency, some suspect there was never any such thing: But this suspicion is removed, by the large quantities of a salt, nearly of the same nature, thrown out by mount \u00c6tna.

The steam swells up the cotton, and forms a paste at the vent-hole, hindering the salts from evaporating; which, being confined, stick to the top of the bottle, and are, upon breaking it, taken out in those large cakes, which they send to England.

It is bounded on the N. by the Frozen Sea, on the E. by the Eastern Ocean, which is part of the South Sea, on the S. by the Indian Sea, and on the W. by Europe and Africa. It is of larger extent than any of the three parts in our continent. Arts and sciences were early cultivated here; though they are thought to have come originally from Egypt; but all the considerable religions now known had their first beginning in Asia; and there are still a great number of people who maintain their ancient tenets, which, according to them, are a hundred thousand years old. They have one sort of religion in China, and another in India, whose priests are the Brachmins; not to mention the Jews, Christians, and Mahometans, whose beginnings are sufficiently known to all the world. This was the seat of several ancient empires or monarchies; such as that of the Assyrians, Medes, Persians, and Greeks. It is 4740 miles in length from the Dardanels on the W. to the eastern shore of Tartary; and 4380 in breadth from the most southern part of Malacca, to the most northern cape of Nova Zembla. It may be divided into ten great parts, namely, Turkey in Asia, Arabia, Persia, the Mogul's empire, with the two peninsulas of India, Thibet, China, and Corea; Great and Little Bocharia, with Carazm, Little and Great Tartary, Siberia, and the Islands. The governments of Asia are generally monarchical; and Turkey, Persia, the Mogul's Empire, Thibet, and China, are subject to single monarchs; but the rest is divided among several sovereigns; inasmuch that there are reckoned seven emperors, and 30 kings, besides petty princes, and the rajas of India, which are very numerous. With regard to the extent of their religions, the Christian is but small in respect of the Mahometan, which comprehends one third of Asia; and the Pagan is near twice as much extended as the Mahometan. Beside these, some pretend there is the natural religion, which has about as many followers as the Christian. The languages are so many and so various, that it is impossible to enumerate them; but the chief are the Turkish, the Grecian, the Arabic, the Chinese, the Persian, and the Old Indian. In short, every country and island has almost a distinct language.

Of Astronomy in general.\n\nBy astronomy we discover that the earth is at so great a distance from the sun, that if seen from thence it would appear no bigger than a point, although its circumference is known to be 25,020 miles. Yet that distance is so small, compared with the earth's distance from the fixed stars, that if the orbit in which the earth moves round the sun were solid, and seen from the nearest star, it would likewise appear no bigger than a point, although it is at least 162 millions of miles in diameter. For the earth, in going round the sun, is 162 millions of miles nearer to some of the stars at one time of the year than at another; and yet their apparent magnitudes, situations, and distances from one another still remain the same; and a telescope which magnifies above 200 times does not sensibly magnify them; which proves them to be at least 400 thousands times farther from us than we are from the sun.\n\nIt is not to be imagined that all the stars are placed in one concave surface, so as to be equally distant from us; but that they are scattered at immense distances from one another through unlimited space. So that there may be as great a distance between any two neighbouring stars, as between our sun and those which are nearest to him. Therefore an observer, who is nearest any fixed star, will look upon it alone as a real sun; and consider the rest as so many shining points, placed at equal distances from him in the firmament.\n\nBy the help of telescopes we discover thousands of stars which are invisible to the naked eye; and the better our glasses are, the more become visible; so that no limits can be set either to their number or their distances.\n\nThe sun appears very bright and large in comparison of the fixed stars, because we keep constantly near the sun, in comparison of our immense distance from the stars. For a spectator, placed as near to any star as we are to the sun, would see that star a body as large and bright as the sun appears to us: and a spectator, as far distant from the sun as we are from the stars, would see the sun as small as we see a star, divested of all its circumvolving planets; and would reckon it one of the stars in numbering them.\n\nThe stars, being at such immense distances from the sun, cannot possibly receive from him so strong a light as they seem to have; nor any brightness sufficient to make them visible to us. For the sun's rays must be so scattered and dissipated before they reach such remote objects, that they can never be transmitted back to our eyes, so as to render these objects visible by reflexion. The stars therefore shine with their own native and unborrowed lustre, as the sun does; and since each particular star, as well as the sun, is confined to a particular portion of space, it is plain that the stars are of the same nature with the sun.\n\nIt is noways probable that the Almighty, who always acts with infinite wisdom, and does nothing in vain, should create so many glorious suns, fit for so many important purposes, and place them at such distances from one another, without proper objects near enough to be benefited by their influences. Whoever imagines they were created only to give a faint glimmering light to the inhabitants of this globe, must have a very superficial knowledge of astronomy, and a mean opinion of the Divine Wisdom; since, by an infinitely less exertion of creating power, the Deity could have given our earth much more light by one single additional moon.\n\nInstead then of one sun and one world only in the universe, astronomy discovers to us such an inconceivable number of suns, systems, and worlds, dispersed through boundless space, that if our sun, with all the planets, moons, and comets belonging to it, were annihilated, they would be no more missed, by an eye that could take in the whole creation, than a grain of sand from the sea-shore: The space they possess being comparatively so small, that it would scarce be a sensible blank in the universe, although Saturn, the outermost of our planets, revolves about the sun in an orbit of 4884 millions of miles in circumference, and some of our comets make excursions upwards of ten thousand millions of miles beyond Saturn's orbit; and yet, at that amazing distance, they are incomparably nearer to the sun than to any of the stars; as is evident from their keeping clear of the attractive power of all the stars, and returning periodically by virtue of the sun's attraction.\n\nFrom what we know of our own system, it may be reasonably concluded, that all the rest are with equal wisdom contrived, situated, and provided with accommodations for rational inhabitants. Let us therefore take a survey of the system to which we belong; the only one accessible to us; and from thence we shall be the better enabled to judge of the nature and end of the other systems of the universe. For although there is almost an infinite variety in the parts of the creation which we have opportunities of examining, yet there is a general analogy running through, and connecting all the parts into one great and universal system.\n\nTo an attentive considerer, it will appear highly probable, that the planets of our system, together with their attendants called satellites or moons, are much of the\nthe same nature with our earth, and destined for the like purposes. For they are solid opaque globes, capable of supporting animals and vegetable. Some of them are larger, some less, and some much about the size of our earth. They all circulate round the sun, as the earth does, in a shorter or longer time, according to their respective distances from him; and have, where it would not be inconvenient, regular returns of summer and winter, spring and autumn. They have warmer and colder climates, as the various productions of our earth require: And, in such as afford a possibility of discovering it, we observe a regular motion round their axes like that of our earth, causing an alternate return of day and night; which is necessary for labour, rest, and vegetation, and that all parts of their surfaces may be exposed to the rays of the sun.\n\nSuch of the planets as are farthest from the sun, and therefore enjoy least of his light, have that deficiency made up by several moons, which constantly accompany and revolve about them, as our moon revolves about the earth. The remotest planet has, over and above, a broad ring encompassing it; which like a lucid zone in the heavens reflects the sun's light very copiously on that planet; so that if the remoter planets have the sun's light fainter by day than we, they have an addition made to it morning and evening by one or more of their moons, and a greater quantity of light in the night-time.\n\nOn the surface of the moon, because it is nearer us than any other of the celestial bodies are, we discover a nearer resemblance of our earth. For, by the assistance of telescopes, we observe the moon to be full of high mountains, large valleys, and deep cavities. These similarities leave us no room to doubt, but that all the planets and moons in the system are designed as commodious habitations for creatures endowed with capacities of knowing and adoring their benevolent Creator.\n\nSince the fixed stars are prodigious spheres of fire like our sun, and at inconceivable distances from one another as well as from us, it is reasonable to conclude they are made for the same purposes that the sun is; each to below light, heat, and vegetation, on a certain number of inhabited planets, kept by gravitation within the sphere of its activity.\n\n**Chap. II. Of the Solar System.**\n\nThe planets and comets which move round the sun as their centre, constitute the Solar System. Those planets which are near the sun not only finish their circuits sooner, but likewise move faster in their respective orbits, than those which are more remote from him. Their motions are all performed from west to east, in orbits nearly circular. Their names, distances, bulks, and periodical revolutions, are as follow.\n\nThe Sun \u2609, an immense globe of fire, is placed near the common centre, or rather in the lower focus, of the orbits of all the planets and comets; and turns round his axis in 25 days 6 hours, as is evident by the motion of spots seen on his surface. His diameter is computed to be 763,000 miles; and, by the various attractions of the circumvolving planets, he is agitated by a small motion round the centre of gravity of the system. All the planets, as seen from him, move the same way, and according to the order of signs in the graduated circle \u2648 \u2649 \u264a \u264b \u264c \u264d \u264e \u264f \u2650 \u2651 \u2652 \u2653 \u2654 \u2655 \u2656 \u2657 \u2658 \u2659 \u265a \u265b \u265c \u265d \u265e \u265f, &c. Plate XL. fig. 2, which represents the great ecliptic in the heavens: But, as seen from any one planet, the rest appear sometimes to go backward, sometimes forward, and sometimes to stand still; not in circles nor ellipses, but in looped curves which never return into themselves. The comets come from all parts of the heavens, and move in all sorts of directions.\n\nThe axis of a planet is a line conceived to be drawn through its centre, about which it revolves as on a real axis. The extremities of this line, terminating in opposite points of the planet's surface, are called its poles. That which points towards the northern part of the heavens, is called the north pole; and the other, pointing towards the southern part, is called the south pole. A bowl whirled from one's hand into the open air turns round such a line within itself, whilst it moves forward; and such are the lines we mean, when we speak of the axes of the heavenly bodies.\n\nLet us suppose the earth's orbit to be a thin, even, solid plane; cutting the sun through the centre, and extended out as far as the starry heavens, where it will mark the great circle called the ecliptic. This circle we suppose to be divided into 12 equal parts, called signs; each sign into 30 equal parts, called degrees; each degree into 60 equal parts, called minutes; and every minute into 60 equal parts, called seconds: So that a second is the 60th part of a minute; a minute the 60th part of a degree; and a degree the 360th part of a circle, or 30th part of a sign. The planes of the orbits of all the other planets likewise cut the sun in halves; but, extended to the heavens, form circles different from one another, and from the ecliptic; one half of each being on the north side, and the other on the south side of it. Consequently the orbit of each planet crosses the ecliptic in two opposite points, which are called the planet's nodes. These nodes are all in different parts of the ecliptic; and therefore, if the planetary tracks remained visible in the heavens, they would in some measure resemble the different runs of waggon-wheels crossing one another in different parts, but never going far asunder. That node, or intersection of the orbit of any planet with the earth's orbit, from which the planet ascends northward above the ecliptic, is called the ascending node of the planet; and the other, which is directly opposite thereto, is called its descending node. Saturn's ascending node is in 21 deg. 13 min. of Cancer \u2653; Jupiter's in 7 deg. 29 min. of the same sign, Mars's in 17 deg. 17 min. of Taurus \u2649, Venus's in 13 deg. 59 min. of Gemini \u264a, and Mercury's in 14 deg. 43 min. of Taurus \u264b. Here we consider the earth's orbit as the standard, and the orbits of all the other planets as oblique to it.\n\nWhen we speak of the planets' orbits, all that is meant is their paths through the open and unchanging space in which they move, and are kept in, by the attractive power of the sun, and the projectile force impressed up-\non them at first; between which power and force there is so exact an adjustment, that they continue in the same tracks without any solid orbits to confine them.\n\n**Mercury**, the nearest planet to the sun, goes round him (as in a circle marked $S$, Plate XXXIX. fig. 1.) in 87 days 23 hours of our time nearly; which is the length of his year. But, being seldom seen, and no spots appearing on his surface or disk, the time of his rotation on his axis, or the length of his days and nights, is as yet unknown. His distance from the sun is computed to be 32 millions of miles, and his diameter 2600. In his course round the sun, he moves at the rate of 95 thousand miles every hour. His light and heat from the sun are almost seven times as great as ours; and the sun appears to him almost seven times as large as to us. The great heat on this planet is no argument against its being inhabited; since the Almighty could as easily fit the bodies and constitutions of its inhabitants to the heat of their dwelling, as he has done ours to the temperature of our earth. And it is very probable that the people there have such an opinion of us, as we have of the inhabitants of Jupiter and Saturn; namely, that we must be intolerably cold, and have very little light at so great a distance from the sun.\n\nThis planet appears to us with all the various phases of the moon, when viewed at different times by a good telescope; excepting only that he never appears quite full, because his enlightened side is never turned directly towards us but when he is so near the sun as to be lost to our sight in its beams. And, as his enlightened side is always toward the sun, it is plain that he shines not by any light of his own; for if he did, he would constantly appear round. That he moves about the sun in an orbit within the earth\u2019s orbit is also plain, (as will be shewn afterwards), because he is never seen opposite to the sun, nor above 56 times the sun\u2019s breadth from his centre.\n\nHis orbit is inclined seven degrees to the ecliptic; and that node from which he ascends northward above the ecliptic is in the 14th degree of Taurus; the opposite, in the 14th degree of Scorpio. The earth is in these points on the 6th of November and 4th of May, new style; and when Mercury comes to either of his nodes at his inferior conjunction about these times, he will appear to pass over the disk or face of the sun, like a dark round spot; but in all other parts of his orbit his conjunctions are invisible, because he either goes above or below the sun.\n\nMr Whiston has given us an account of several periods at which Mercury may be seen on the sun\u2019s disk, viz., in the year 1782, Nov. 12th, at 3 h. 44 m. in the afternoon; 1786, May 4th, at 6 h. 57 m. in the forenoon; 1789, Dec. 6th, at 3 h. 55 min. in the afternoon; and 1799, May 7th, at 2 h. 34 m. in the afternoon. There will be several intermediate transits, but none of them visible to us.\n\n**Venus**, the next planet in order, is computed to be 59 millions of miles from the sun; and by moving at the rate of 69 thousand miles every hour in her orbit, (as in the circle marked $Q$), she goes round the sun in 224 days 17 hours of our time nearly. But though this be the full length of her year, as she performs only $9\\frac{1}{2}$ revolutions on her own axis in that time, her year consists only of $9\\frac{1}{2}$ days; so that in her, every day and night together is as long as $2\\frac{1}{2}$ days and nights with us. This odd quarter of a day in every year makes every fourth year a leap-year to Venus; as the like does to our earth. Her diameter is 7906 miles; and by her diurnal motion the inhabitants about her equator are carried 43 miles every hour, besides the 69,000 above mentioned.\n\nHer orbit includes that of Mercury within it; for at her greatest elongation, or apparent distance from the sun, she is 96 times his breadth from his centre; which is almost double of Mercury\u2019s. Her orbit is included by the earth\u2019s; for if it were not, the might be seen as often in opposition to the sun, as she is in conjunction with him; but she was never seen 90 degrees, or a fourth part of a circle, from the sun.\n\nWhen Venus appears west of the sun, she rises before him in the morning, and is called the morning-star; when she appears east of the sun, she shines in the evening after he sets, and is then called the evening-star; being each in its turn for 290 days. It may perhaps be surprising at first, that Venus should keep longer on the east or west of the sun, than the whole time of her period round him. But the difficulty vanishes when we consider, that the earth is all the while going round the sun the same way, though not so quick as Venus; and therefore her relative motion to the earth must in every period be as much slower than her absolute motion in her orbit, as the earth during that time advances forward in the ecliptic, which is 220 degrees. To us she appears, through a telescope, in all the various shapes of the moon.\n\nThe axis of Venus is inclined 75 degrees to the axis of her orbit; which is $51\\frac{1}{2}$ degrees more than our earth\u2019s axis is inclined to the axis of the ecliptic; and therefore her seasons vary much more than ours do. The north pole of her axis inclines toward the 20th degree of Aquarius, our earth\u2019s to the beginning of Cancer; consequently the northern parts of Venus have summer in the signs where those of our earth have winter, and vice versa.\n\nThe artificial day at each pole of Venus is as long as $112\\frac{1}{2}$ natural days on our earth.\n\nThe sun\u2019s greatest declination on each side of her equator amounts to 75 degrees; therefore her tropics are only 15 degrees from her poles, and her polar circles as far from her equator. Consequently, the tropics of Venus are between her polar circles and her poles; contrary to what those of our earth are.\n\nAs her annual revolution contains only $9\\frac{1}{2}$ of her days, the sun will always appear to go through a whole sign, or twelfth part of her orbit, in little more than three quarters of her natural day, or nearly in $18\\frac{1}{2}$ of our days and nights.\n\nBecause her day is so great a part of her year, the sun changes his declination in one day so much, that if he passes vertically, or directly over head of any given place on the tropic, the next day he will be 26 degrees from\nfrom it; and whatever place he passes vertically over when in the equator, one day's revolution will remove him $36\\frac{1}{4}$ degrees from it. So that the sun changes his declination every day in Venus about 14 degrees more at a mean rate, than he does in a quarter of a year on our earth. This appears to be providentially ordered, for preventing the too great effects of the sun's heat, (which is twice as great on Venus as on the earth), so that he cannot shine perpendicularly on the same places for two days together; and by that means the heated places have time to cool.\n\nIf the inhabitants about the north pole of Venus fix their south or meridian line through that part of the heavens where the sun comes to his greatest height, or north declination, and call those the east and west points of their horizon, which are 90 degrees on each side from that point where the horizon is cut by the meridian line, these inhabitants will have the following remarkable things.\n\nThe sun will rise $22\\frac{1}{2}$ degrees north of the east; and going on $112\\frac{1}{2}$ degrees, as measured on the plane of the horizon, he will cross the meridian at an altitude of $12\\frac{1}{2}$ degrees; then making an entire revolution without setting, he will cross it again at an altitude of $48\\frac{1}{2}$ degrees; at the next revolution he will cross the meridian as he comes to his greatest height and declination, at the altitude of $75$ degrees; being then only $15$ degrees from the zenith, or that point of the heavens which is directly over head; and thence he will descend in the like spiral manner, crossing the meridian first at the altitude of $48\\frac{1}{2}$ degrees; next at the altitude of $12\\frac{1}{2}$ degrees; and going on thence $112\\frac{1}{2}$ degrees, he will let $22\\frac{1}{2}$ degrees north of the west; so that, after having been $4\\frac{1}{2}$ revolutions above the horizon, he descends below it to exhibit the like appearances at the south pole.\n\nAt each pole, the sun continues half a year without setting in summer, and as long without rising in winter; consequently the polar inhabitants of Venus have only one day and one night in the year, as it is at the poles of our earth. But the difference between the heat of summer and cold of winter, or of mid-day and midnight, on Venus, is much greater than on the earth; because in Venus, as the sun is for half a year together above the horizon of each pole in its turn, so he is for a considerable part of that time near the zenith; and during the other half of the year always below the horizon, and for a great part of that time at least $70$ degrees from it. Whereas, at the poles of our earth, although the sun is for half a year together above the horizon, yet he never ascends above, nor descends below it, more than $23\\frac{1}{2}$ degrees. When the sun is in the equinoctial, or in that circle which divides the northern half of the heavens from the southern, he is seen with one half of his disk above the horizon of the north pole, and the other half above the horizon of the south pole; so that his centre is in the horizon of both poles: and then descending below the horizon of one, he ascends gradually above that of the other. Hence, in a year, each pole has one spring, one harvest, a summer as long as them both, and a winter equal in length to the other three seasons.\n\nVol. I. No. 19.\n\nAt the polar circles of Venus, the seasons are much the same as at the equator, because there are only $15$ degrees betwixt them; only the winters are not quite so long, nor the summers so short; but the four seasons come twice round every year.\n\nAt Venus's tropics, the sun continues for about fifteen of our weeks together without setting in summer, and as long without rising in winter. Whilst he is more than $15$ degrees from the equator, he neither rises to the inhabitants of the one tropic, nor sets to those of the other; whereas, at our terrestrial tropics, he rises and sets every day of the year.\n\nAt Venus's tropics, the seasons are much the same as at her poles; only the summers are a little longer, and the winters a little shorter.\n\nAt her equator, the days and nights are always of the same length, and yet the diurnal and nocturnal arches are very different, especially when the sun's declination is about the greatest; for then his meridian altitude may sometimes be twice as great as his midnight depression, and at other times the reverse. When the sun is at his greatest declination, either north or south, his rays are as oblique at Venus's equator, as they are at London on the shortest day of winter. Therefore, at her equator there are two winters, two summers, two springs, and two autumns every year. But because the sun stays for some time near the tropics, and passes so quickly over the equator, every winter there will be almost twice as long as summer; the four seasons returning twice in that time, which consists only of $9\\frac{1}{2}$ days.\n\nThose parts of Venus which lie between the poles and tropics, and between the tropics and polar circles, and also between the polar circles and equator, partake more or less of the phenomena of these circles as they are more or less distant from them.\n\nFrom the quick change of the sun's declination it happens, that if he rises due east on any day, he will not set due west on that day, as with us; for if the place where he rises due east be on the equator, he will set on that day almost west-north-west, or about $18\\frac{1}{2}$ degrees north of the west. But if the place be in $45$ degrees north latitude, then on the day that the sun rises due east he will set north-west by west, or $33$ degrees north of the west, and in $62$ degrees north latitude. When he rises in the east, he sets not in that revolution, but just touches the horizon $10$ degrees to the west of the north point, and ascends again, continuing for $3\\frac{1}{2}$ revolutions above the horizon without setting. Therefore, no place has the forenoon and afternoon of the same day equally long, unless it be in the equator, or at the poles.\n\nThe sun's altitude at noon, or at any other time of the day, and his amplitude at rising and setting, being very different at places on the same parallel of latitude, according to the different longitudes of those places, the longitude will be almost as easily found on Venus as the latitude is found on the earth; which is an advantage we can never enjoy, because the daily change of the sun's declination is by much too small for that important purpose.\n\nOn this planet, where the sun crosses the equator in any year, he will have $9$ degrees of declination from that place\nplace on the same day and hour next year, and will cross the equator 90 degrees farther to the west; which makes the time of the equinox a quarter of a day (or about six of our days) later every year. Hence, although the spiral in which the sun's motion is performed, be of the same sort every year, yet it will not be the very same, because the sun will not pass vertically over the same places till four annual revolutions are finished.\n\nVenus's orbit is inclined $3\\frac{1}{2}$ degrees to the earth's; and crosses it in the 14th degree of Gemini and of Sagittarius; and therefore, when the earth is about these points of the ecliptic at the time that Venus is in her inferior conjunction, she will appear like a spot on the sun, and afford a more certain method of finding the distances of all the planets from the sun, than any other yet known. But these appearances happen very seldom. The first was in the year 1639. The second in the year 1761, June 6. In the morning of that day, when the sun rose at London, Venus had passed both the external and internal contacts. At 38 minutes 21 seconds past 7 o'clock, (apparent time) at Greenwich, the Rev. Dr Bliss, astronomer royal, first saw Venus on the sun; at which instant, the centre of Venus preceded the sun's centre, by $6'18''$.9 of right ascension, and was south of the sun's centre by $18'42''.1$ of declination.\u2014From that time to the beginning of ingress, the Doctor made several observations, both of the difference of right ascension and declination of the centres of the sun and Venus; and at last found the beginning of ingress, or instant of the internal contact of Venus with the sun's limb, to be at 8 hours 19 minutes 0 seconds apparent time.\u2014From the Doctor's own observations, and those which were made at Shirburn by another gentleman, he has computed, that the mean time at Greenwich of the ecliptical conjunction of the sun and Venus was at 51 minutes 20 seconds after 5 o'clock in the morning; that the place of the sun and Venus was Gemini $15'36''.33''$; that the geocentric latitude of Venus was $9'44''.9$ south,\u2014her horary motion from the sun $3'57''.13$ retrograde, and the angle then formed by the axis of the equator and the axis of the ecliptic was $6'9''.34''$, decreasing hourly 1 minute of a degree.\u2014By the mean of three good observations, the diameter of Venus on the sun was $58''$.\n\nMr Short made his observations at Savile-house, in London, 30 seconds in time west from Greenwich, in presence of his royal highnesses the duke of York, accompanied by their royal highnesses prince William, prince Henry, and prince Frederick.\u2014He first saw Venus on the sun, through flying clouds, at 46 minutes 37 seconds after 5 o'clock; and at 6 hours 15 minutes 12 seconds he measured the diameter of Venus $59''.8$\u2014He afterward found it to be $58''.9$, when the sky was more favourable.\u2014And, through a reflecting telescope of two feet focus, magnifying 140 times, he found the internal contact of Venus with the sun's limb to be at 8 hours 18 minutes 21$\\frac{1}{2}$ seconds, apparent time; which being reduced to the apparent time at Greenwich, was 8 hours 18 minutes 51$\\frac{1}{2}$ seconds; so that his time of seeing the contact was 8$\\frac{1}{2}$ seconds sooner (in absolute time) than the instant of its being seen at Greenwich.\n\nMessrs Ellicott and Dollond observed the internal contact at Hackney; and their time of seeing it, reduced to the time at Greenwich, was at 8 hours 18 minutes 56 seconds, which was 4 seconds sooner in absolute time than the contact was seen at Greenwich.\n\nMr Canton in Spittle-Square, London, $4'11''$ west of Greenwich, (equal to 16 seconds 44 thirds of time), measured the sun's diameter $31'33''.24''$, and the diameter of Venus on the sun $58''$; and, by observation, found the apparent time of the internal contact of Venus with the sun's limb to be at 8 hours 18 minutes 41 seconds; which, by reduction, was only 2$\\frac{1}{2}$ seconds short of the time at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich.\n\nThe Reverend Mr Richard Haydon, at Liskeard in Cornwall, (16 minutes 10 seconds in time west from London, as stated by Dr Bevis), observed the internal contact to be at 8 hours 0 minutes 20 seconds, which, by reduction, was 8 hours 16 minutes 30 seconds at Greenwich; so that he must have seen it 2 minutes 30 seconds sooner in absolute time than it was seen at Greenwich;\u2014a difference by much too great to be occasioned by the difference of parallaxes. But by a memorandum of Mr Hayden's some years before, it appears that he then supposed his west longitude to be near two minutes more; which brings his time to agree within half a minute of the time at Greenwich; to which the parallaxes will very nearly answer.\n\nAt Stockholm Observatory, latitude $59\u00b020'\\frac{1}{2}$ north, and longitude 1 hour 12 minutes east from Greenwich, the whole of the transit was visible: the total ingress was observed by Mr Wargentin to be at 3 hours 39 minutes 23 seconds in the morning, and the beginning of ingress at 9 hours 30 minutes 8 seconds; so that the whole duration between the two internal contacts, as seen at that place, was 5 hours 50 minutes 45 seconds.\n\nAt Torneo in Lapland, (1 hour 27 minutes 28 seconds east of Paris), Mr Hellant, who is esteemed a very good observer, found the total ingress to be at 4 hours 3 minutes 59 seconds, and the beginning of ingress to be 9 hours 54 minutes 8 seconds.\u2014So that the whole duration between the two internal contacts was 5 hours 50 minutes 9 seconds.\n\nAt Hernofand in Sweden, (latitude $6\u00b038'$ north, and longitude 1 hour 2 minutes 12 seconds east of Paris), Mr Gilter observed the total ingress to be at 3 hours 38 minutes 26 seconds; and the beginning of ingress to be at 9 hours 29 minutes 21 seconds;\u2014the duration between these two internal contacts 5 hours 50 minutes 56 seconds.\n\nMr De La Lande, at Paris, observed the beginning of ingress to be at 8 hours 28 minutes 26 seconds apparent time.\u2014But Mr Ferner (who was then at Conflans, $14''$ west of the Royal Observatory at Paris) observed the beginning of ingress to be at 8 hours 28 minutes 29 seconds true time. The equation, or difference between the true and apparent time, was 1 minute 54 seconds.\u2014The total ingress, being before the sun rose, could not be seen.\n\nAt Tobolsk in Siberia, Mr Chappe observed the total ingress to be at 7 hours 0 minutes 28 seconds in the morning, and the beginning of ingress to be at 49 minutes 20$\\frac{1}{2}$ seconds after 12 at noon.\u2014So that the whole duration of the transit between the internal contacts was 5 hours...\nhours 48 minutes 52 seconds, as seen at that place; which was 2 minutes 3 seconds less than as seen at Heronosand in Sweden.\n\nAt Madras, the Reverend Mr Hirst observed the total ingress to be at 7 hours 47 minutes 55 seconds apparent time in the morning, and the beginning of egress at 1 hour 39 minutes 38 seconds past noon.\u2014The duration between these two internal contacts was 5 hours 51 minutes 43 seconds.\n\nProfessor Mathenici at Bologna observed the beginning of egress to be at 9 hours 4 minutes 58 seconds.\n\nAt Calcutta, (latitude 22\u00b0 30' north, nearly 92\u00b0 east longitude from London), Mr William Magee observed the total ingress to be at 8 hours 20 minutes 58 seconds in the morning, and the beginning of egress to be at 2 hours 11 minutes 34 seconds in the afternoon; the duration between the two internal contacts 5 hours 50 minutes 36 seconds.\n\nAt the Cape of Good Hope, (1 hour 13 minutes 35 seconds east from Greenwich), Mr Mafson observed the beginning of egress to be at 9 hours 39 minutes 50 seconds in the morning.\n\nAll these times are collected from the observers accounts, printed in the Philosophical Transactions for the years 1762 and 1763, in which there are several other other accounts that are not transcribed.\u2014The instants of Venus's total exit from the sun are likewise mentioned, but they are here left out, as not of any use for finding the sun's parallax.\n\nWhoever compares these times of the internal contacts, as given in by different observers, will find such differences among them, even those which were taken upon the same spot, as will shew, that the instant of either contact could not be so accurately perceived by the observers as Dr Halley thought it could; which probably arises from the difference of peoples eyes, and the different magnifying powers of those telescopes through which the contacts were seen.\u2014If all the observers had made use of equal magnifying powers, there can be no doubt but that the times would have more nearly coincided; since it is plain, that supposing all their eyes to be equally quick and good, they whose telescopes magnified most would perceive the point of internal contact firstest, and of the total exit latest.\n\nMr Short, in a paper published in the Philosophical Transactions, Vol. LII. Part II., has taken an incredible deal of pains in deducing the quantity of the sun's parallax, from the best of those observations which were made both in Britain and abroad; and finds it to have been 8\".52 on the day of the transit when the sun was very nearly at his greatest distance from the earth; and consequently 8\".65 when the sun is at his mean distance from the earth.\n\nThe log. sine (or tangent) of 8\".65 is 5.6219140, which being subtracted from the radius 10.0000000, leaves remaining the logarithm 4.3780860, whose number is 23882.84; which is the number of semidiameters of the earth that the sun is distant from it.\u2014And this last number, 23882.84, being multiplied by 3985, the number of English miles contained in the earth's semidiameter, gives 95,173,117 miles from the earth's mean distance from the sun.\u2014But because it is impossible, from the nicest observations of the sun's parallax, to be sure of his true distance from the earth within 100 miles, we shall at present, for the sake of round numbers, state the earth's mean distance from the sun at 95,173,000 English miles.\n\nAnd then, from the numbers and analogies in \u00a7 11. & 14. of Mr Short's dissertation, we find the mean distances of all the rest of the planets from the sun, in miles, to be as follows.\u2014Mercury's distance, 36,841,468; Venus's distance, 68,891,486; Mars's distance, 145,014,148; Jupiter's distance, 494,990,976; and Saturn's distance, 907,956,130.\n\nThe semidiameter of the earth's annual orbit being equal to the earth's mean distance from the sun, viz: 95,173,000 miles; the whole diameter thereof is 190,346,000 miles. And since the circumference of a circle is to its diameter as 355 is to 113, the circumference of the earth's orbit is 597,989,646 miles.\n\nAnd, as the earth describes this orbit in 365 days 6 hours (or in 8766 hours) it is plain that it travels at the rate of 68,216.9 miles every hour; and consequently 1136.9 miles every minute; so that its velocity in its orbit is at least 142 times as great as the velocity of a cannon-ball, supposing the ball to move through 8 miles in a minute, which it is found to do very nearly: And at this rate it would take 22 years 228 days for a cannonball to go from the earth to the sun.\n\nOn the 3d of June, in the year 1769, Venus again passed over the sun's disk, in such a manner, as to afford a much easier and better method of investigating the sun's parallax than her transit in the year 1761. But as few of the observations upon this transit have as yet been made public, we can only give the following, made by different observers at London.\n\n| External contact | Regular circumferences in contact | Thread of light completed, or the internal contact | Telescopes made use of | Magnifying power |\n|------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------|\n| N.

Mr Macleay saw her whole circumference completed, by means of a vivid, but narrow and ill-defined border of light, which illuminated that part of her circumference which was off the sun, and otherwise not visible. They all observed the black protuberance in the internal contact. They likewise, after the internal contact, saw a luminous ring round the body of Venus, about the thickness of half her semi-diameter; it was brightest towards Venus's body, and gradually diminished in splendor at greater distance, but the whole was excessive white and faint.\n\nVenus may have a satellite or moon, although it be undiscovered by us: which will not appear very surprising, if we consider how inconveniently we are placed from seeing it. For its enlightened side can never be fully turned towards us, but when Venus is beyond the sun; and then, as Venus appears little bigger than an ordinary star, her moon may be too small to be perceived at such a distance. When she is between us and the sun, her full moon has its dark side towards us; and then we cannot see it any more than we can our own moon at the time of change. When Venus is at her greatest elongation, we have but one half of the enlightened side of her full moon towards us; and even then it may be too far distant to be seen by us.\n\nThe Earth is the next planet above Venus in the system. It is 82 millions of miles from the sun, and goes round him (as in the circle \u2295) in 365 days 5 hours 49 minutes, from any equinox or solstice to the same again; but from any fixed star to the same again, as seen from the sun, in 365 days 6 hours and 9 minutes; the former being the length of the tropical year, and the latter the length of the sidereal. It travels the rate of 58 thousand miles every hour; which motion, though 120 times swifter than that of a cannon-ball, is little more than half as swift as Mercury's motion in his orbit. The earth's diameter is 7970 miles; and by turning round its axis every 24 hours from west to east, it causes an apparent diurnal motion of all the heavenly bodies from east to west. By this rapid motion of the earth on its axis, the inhabitants about the equator are carried 1042 miles every hour, whilst those on the parallel of London are carried only about 580, besides the 58 thousand miles by the annual motion above mentioned, which is common to all places whatever.\n\nThe earth's axis makes an angle of 23\u00bd degrees with the axis of its orbit, and keeps always the same oblique direction, inclining towards the same fixed stars throughout its annual course, which causes the returns of spring, summer, autumn, and winter; as will be explained afterwards.\n\nThe earth is round like a globe; as appears, 1. By its shadow in eclipses of the moon, which shadow is always bounded by a circular ring. 2. By our seeing the masts of a ship whilst the hull is hid by the convexity of the water. 3. By its having been sailed round by many navigators. The hills take off no more from the roundness of the earth in comparison, than grains of dust do from the roundness of a common globe.\n\nThe seas and unknown parts of the earth (by a measurement of the best maps) contain 160 million 522 thousand and 26 square miles; the inhabited parts 38 million 990 thousand 569; Europe 4 million 456 thousand and 65; Asia, 10 million 768 thousand 823; Africa, 9 million 654 thousand 807; America, 14 million 110 thousand 874. In all, 199 million 512 thousand 595; which is the number of square miles on the whole surface of our globe.\n\nThe Moon is not a planet, but only a satellite or attendant of the earth; going round the earth from change to change in 29 days 12 hours and 44 minutes; and round the sun with it every year. The moon's diameter is 2180 miles; and her distance from the earth's centre 249 thousand. She goes round her orbit in 27 days 7 hours 43 minutes, moving about 2290 miles every hour; and turns round her axis exactly in the same time that she goes round the earth, which is the reason of her keeping always the same side towards us, and that her day and night, taken together, is as long as our lunar month.\n\nThe moon is an opaque globe like the earth, and shines only by reflecting the light of the sun: Therefore whilst that half of her which is toward the sun is enlightened, the other half must be dark and invisible. Hence, she disappears when she comes between us and the sun; because her dark side is then towards us. When she is gone a little way forward, we see a little of her enlightened side; which still increases to our view, as she advances forward, until she comes to be opposite the sun; and then her whole enlightened side is towards the earth, and she appears with a round, illumined orb, which we call the full moon; her dark side being then turned away from the earth. From the full she seems to decrease gradually as she goes through the other half of her course; shewing us less and less of her enlightened side every day, till her next change or conjunction with the sun, and then she disappears as before.\n\nThis continual change of the moon's phases demonstrates that she shines not by any light of her own; for if she did, being globular, we should always see her with a round full orb like the sun. Her orbit is represented in the scheme by the little circle m, upon the earth's orbit \u2295, Plate XXXIX, fig. 1.; but it is drawn fifty times too large in proportion to the earth's; and yet is almost too small to be seen in the diagram.\n\nThe moon has scarce any difference of seasons; her axis being almost perpendicular to the ecliptic. What is very singular, one half of her has no darkness at all; the earth constantly affording it a strong light in the sun's absence; while the other half has a fortnight's darkness, and a fortnight's light by turns.\n\nOur earth is a moon to the moon, waxing and waning regularly, but appearing thirteen times as big; and affording her thirteen times as much light as she does to us. When the changes to us, the earth appears full to her; and when she is in her first quarter to us, the earth is in its third quarter to her; and vice versa.\n\nBut from one half of the moon, the earth is never seen at all; from the middle of the other half, it is always seen over head; turning round almost thirty times as quick as the moon does. From the circle which limits our view of the moon, only one half of the earth's\nside next her is seen; the other half being hid below the horizon of all places on that circle. To her the earth seems to be the largest body in the universe, for it appears thirteen times as large as she does to us.\n\nThe moon has no atmosphere of any visible density surrounding her; for if she had, we could never see her edge so well defined as it appears; but there would be a sort of a mist or haziness around her, which would make the stars look fainter, when they are seen through it. But observation proves, that the stars which disappear behind the moon retain their full lustre until they seem to touch her very edge, and then they vanish in a moment. The faint light which has been seen all around the moon in total eclipses of the sun, has been observed, during the time of darkness, to have its centre coincident with the centre of the sun; and was therefore much more likely to arise from the atmosphere of the sun than from that of the moon; for if it had been owing to the latter, its centre would have gone along with the moon's.\n\nIf there were seas in the moon, she could have no clouds, rains, nor storms, as we have; because she has no such atmosphere to support the vapours which occasion them. And every one knows, that when the moon is above our horizon in the night-time, she is visible, unless the clouds of our atmosphere hide her from our view, and all parts of her appear constantly with the same clear, serene, and calm aspect. But those dark parts of the moon, which were formerly thought to be seas, are now found to be only vast deep cavities, and places which reflect not the sun's light so strongly as others, having many caverns and pits, whose shadows fall within them, and are always dark on the sides next the sun, which demonstrates their being hollow; and most of these pits have little knobs like hillocks standing within them, and casting shadows also; which cause these places to appear darker than others which have fewer or less remarkable caverns. All these appearances shew, that there are no seas in the moon; for if there were any, their surfaces would appear smooth and even, like those on the earth.\n\nThere being no atmosphere about the moon, the heavens in the day-time have the appearance of night to a lunarian who turns his back toward the sun; and when he does, the stars appear as bright to him as they do in the night to us. For it is entirely owing to our atmosphere that the heavens are bright about us in the day.\n\nAs the earth turns round its axis, the several continents, seas, and islands appear to the moon's inhabitants like so many spots of different forms and brightness, moving over its surface, but much fainter at some times than others, as our clouds cover them or leave them. By these spots, the lunarians can determine the time of the earth's diurnal motion, just as we do the motion of the sun; and perhaps they measure their time by the motion of the earth's spots, for they cannot have a truer dial.\n\nThe moon's axis is so nearly perpendicular to the ecliptic, that the sun never removes sensibly from her equator; and the obliquity of her orbit, being only $5^\\circ$ degrees, which is next to nothing as seen from the sun, cannot cause the sun to decline sensibly from her equator. Yet her inhabitants are not destitute of means for ascertaining the length of their year, though their method and ours must differ. For we can know the length of our year by the return of our equinoxes; but the lunarians, having always equal day and night, must have recourse to another method; and we may suppose, they measure their year by observing when either of the poles of our earth begins to be enlightened, and the other to disappear, which is always at our equinoxes, they being conveniently situated for observing great tracks of land about our earth's poles, which are entirely unknown to us. Hence we may conclude, that the year is of the same absolute length both to the earth and moon, though very different as to the number of days; we having 365 natural days, and the lunarians only 127$\\frac{1}{2}$ every day and night in the moon-being as long as 29$\\frac{1}{2}$ on the earth.\n\nThe moon's inhabitants on the side next the earth may as easily find the longitude of their places as we can find the latitude of ours. For the earth keeping constantly, or very nearly so, over one meridian of the moon, the east or west distances of places from that meridian are as easily found as we can find our distance from the equator by the altitude of our celestial poles.\n\nThe planet Mars is next in order, being the first above the earth's orbit. His distance from the sun is computed to be 125 millions of miles; and by travelling at the rate of 47 thousand miles every hour, as in the circle $\\theta$, he goes round the sun in 686 of our days and 23 hours; which is the length of his year, and contains 667$\\frac{1}{2}$ of his days, every day and night together being 40 minutes longer than with us. His diameter is 4444 miles, and by his diurnal rotation the inhabitants about his equator are carried 556 miles every hour. His quantity of light and heat is equal but to one half of ours; and the sun appears but half as big to him as to us.\n\nThis planet being but a fifth part so big as the earth, if any moon attends him, it must be very small, and has not yet been discovered by our best telescopes. He is of a fiery red colour, and by his appulses to some of the fixed stars seems to be encompassed by a very gross atmosphere. He appears sometimes gibbous, but never horned; which both shews that his orbit includes the earth's within it, and that he shines not by his own light.\n\nTo Mars, our earth and moon appear like two moons, a bigger and a less, changing places with one another, and appearing sometimes horned, sometimes half or three quarters illuminated, but never full, nor at most above one quarter of a degree from each other, although they are 240 thousand miles asunder.\n\nOur earth appears almost as big to Mars as Venus does to us, and at Mars it is never seen above 48 degrees from the sun; sometimes it appears to pass over the disk of the sun, and so do Mercury and Venus; but Mercury can never be seen from Mars by such eyes as ours, unassisted by proper instruments; and Venus will be as seldom seen as we see Mercury. Jupiter and Saturn are as visible to Mars as to us. His axis is perpendicular to the ecliptic, and his orbit is 2 degrees inclined to it.\n\nJupiter, the largest of all the planets, is still higher in the system, being about 426 millions of miles from the sun; and going at the rate of 25 thousand miles every hour in his orbit, as in the circle $\\theta$, signifies his annual period.\nPeriod in eleven of our years 314 days and 12 hours. He is about 1000 times as big as the earth, for his diameter is 81,000 miles; which is more than ten times the diameter of the earth.\n\nJupiter turns round his axis in 9 hours 56 minutes; so that his year contains 10 thousand 470 days; and the diurnal velocity of his equatorial parts is greater than the swiftness with which he moves in his annual orbit; a singular circumstance, as far as we know. By this prodigious quick rotation, his equatorial inhabitants are carried 25 thousand 920 miles every hour, (which is 920 miles an hour more than an inhabitant of our earth's equator moves in twenty-four hours), besides the 25 thousand above mentioned, which is common to all parts of his surface, by his annual motion.\n\nJupiter is surrounded by faint substances, called belts, in which so many changes appear, that they are generally thought to be clouds; for some of them have been first interrupted and broken, and then have vanished entirely. They have sometimes been observed of different breadths, and afterwards have all become nearly of the same breadth. Large spots have been seen in these belts; and when a belt vanishes, the contiguous spots disappear with it. The broken ends of some belts have been generally observed to revolve in the same time with the spots; only those nearer the equator in somewhat less time than those near the poles, perhaps on account of the sun's greater heat near the equator, which is parallel to the belts and course of the spots. Several large spots, which appear round at one time, grow oblong by degrees, and then divide into two or three round spots.\n\nThe periodical time of the spots near the equator is 9 hours 50 minutes, but of those near the poles 9 hours 56 minutes.\n\nThe axis of Jupiter is so nearly perpendicular to his orbit, that he has no sensible change of seasons; which is a great advantage, and wisely ordered by the Author of nature. For if the axis of this planet were inclined any considerable number of degrees, just so many degrees round each pole would in their turn be almost six of our years together in darkness. And as each degree of a great circle on Jupiter contains 706 of our miles at a mean rate, it is easy to judge what vast tracts of land would be rendered uninhabitable by any considerable inclination of his axis.\n\nThe sun appears but a part so big to Jupiter as to us; and his light and heat are in the same small proportion, but compensated by the quick returns thereof, and by four moons (some larger and some less than our earth) which revolve about him; so that there is scarce any part of this huge planet but what is, during the whole night, enlightened by one or more of these moons, except his poles, whence only the farthest moons can be seen, and where their light is not wanted, because the sun constantly circulates in or near the horizon, and is very probably kept in view of both poles by the refraction of Jupiter's atmosphere, which, if it be like ours, has certainly refractive power enough for that purpose.\n\nThe orbits of these moons are represented in the scheme of the solar system by four small circles marked 1, 2, 3, 4, on Jupiter's orbit 26; but they are drawn fifty times too large in proportion to it. The first moon, or that nearest to Jupiter, goes round him in 1 day 18 hours and 36 minutes of our time; and is 229 thousand miles distant from his centre; the second performs its revolution in three days 13 hours and 15 minutes, at 364 thousand miles distance; the third in seven days three hours and 59 minutes, at the distance of 580 thousand miles; and the fourth, or outermost, in 16 days 18 hours and 30 minutes, at the distance of one million of miles from his centre. The periods of these moons are so incommensurate to one another, that if ever they were all in a right line between Jupiter and the sun, it will require more than 3,000,000,000,000 years from that time to bring them all into the same right line again, as any one will find who reduces all their periods into seconds, then multiplies them into one another, and divides the product by 432; which is the highest number that will divide the product of all their periodical times, namely, 4,2085,303,376,931,994,955,104 seconds, without a remainder.\n\nThe angles under which the orbits of Jupiter's moons are seen from the earth, at its mean distance from Jupiter, are as follow: The first, 3\u00b0 55\u2033; the second, 6\u00b0 14\u2033; the third, 9\u00b0 58\u2033; and the fourth, 17\u00b0 30\u2033. And their distances from Jupiter, measured by his semi-diameters, are thus: The first, 5\u00bd; the second, 9; the third, 14\u00bd; and the fourth, 25\u00bd. This planet, seen from its nearest moon, appears 1000 times as large as our moon does to us; waxing and waning in all her monthly shapes every 42\u00bd hours.\n\nJupiter's three nearest moons fall into his shadow, and are eclipsed in every revolution; but the orbit of the fourth moon is so much inclined, that it pallidly by its opposition to Jupiter, without falling into his shadow, two years in every six. By these eclipses, astronomers have not only discovered that the sun's light takes up eight minutes of time in coming to us, but they have also determined the longitudes of places on this earth with greater certainty and facility than by any other method yet known.\n\nThe difference between the equatorial and polar diameters of Jupiter is 6230 miles; for his equatorial diameter is to his polar, as 13 to 12. So that his poles are 3115 miles nearer his centre than his equator is.\n\nJupiter's orbit is 1 degree 20 minutes inclined to the ecliptic. His north node is in the 7th degree of Cancer, and his south node in the 7th degree of Capricorn.\n\nSaturn, the remotest of all the planets, is about 780 millions of miles from the sun; and, travelling at the rate of 18 thousand miles every hour, as in the circle marked B, performs its annual circuit in 29 years 167 days and 5 hours of our time; which makes only one year to that planet. Its diameter is 67,000 miles; and therefore it is near 600 times as big as the earth.\n\nThis planet is surrounded by a thin broad ring, as an artificial globe is by a horizon, fig. 5. The ring appears double when seen through a good telescope, and is represented by the figure in such an oblique view as it is generally seen. It is inclined 30 degrees to the ecliptic, and is about 21 thousand miles in breadth; which is equal to its distance from Saturn on all sides. There is reason\nreason to believe that the ring turns round its axis, because, when it is almost edge-wise to us, it appears somewhat thicker on one side of the planet than on the other; and the thickest edge has been seen on different sides at different times. But Saturn having no visible spots on his body, whereby to determine the time of his turning round his axis, the length of his days and nights, and the position of his axis, are unknown to us.\n\nTo Saturn, the sun appears only \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\)th part so big as to us; and the light and heat he receives from the sun are in the same proportion to ours. But to compensate for the small quantity of sun-light, he has five moons, all going round him on the outside of his ring, and nearly on the same plane with it. The first, or nearest moon to Saturn, goes round him in 1 day 21 hours 19 minutes; and is 140 thousand miles from his centre: The second, in 2 days 17 hours 40 minutes; at the distance of 187 thousand miles: The third, in 4 days 12 hours 25 minutes, at 263 thousand miles distance: The fourth, in 15 days 22 hours 41 minutes, at the distance of 600 thousand miles: And the fifth or outermost, at one million 800 thousand miles from Saturn's centre, goes round him in 79 days 7 hours 48 minutes. Their orbits, in the scheme of the solar system, are represented by the small five circles, marked 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, on Saturn's orbit; but these, like the orbits of the other satellites, are drawn fifty times too large in proportion to the orbits of their primary planets.\n\nThe sun shines almost fifteen of our years together on one side of Saturn's ring without setting, and as long on the other in its turn. So that the ring is visible to the inhabitants of that planet for almost fifteen of our years, and as long invisible by turns, if its axis has no inclination to its ring: But if the axis of the planet be inclined to the ring, suppose about 30 degrees, the ring will appear and disappear once every natural day to all the inhabitants within 30 degrees of the equator, on both sides, frequently eclipsing the sun in a Saturnian day. Moreover, if Saturn's axis be so inclined to his ring, it is perpendicular to his orbit; and thereby the inconvenience of different seasons to that planet is avoided. For considering the length of Saturn's year, which is almost equal to thirty of ours, what a dreadful condition must the inhabitants of his polar regions be in, if they be half that time deprived of the light and heat of the sun? which is not their case alone, if the axis of the planet be perpendicular to the ring, for then the ring must hide the sun from vast tracks of land on each side of the equator for 13 or 14 of our years together, on the south side and north side by turns, as the axis inclines to or from the sun: The reverse of which inconvenience is another good presumptive proof of the inclination of Saturn's axis to its ring, and also of his axis being perpendicular to his orbit.\n\nThis ring, seen from Saturn, appears like a vast luminous arch in the heavens, as if it did not belong to the planet. When we see the ring most open, its shadow upon the planet is broadest; and from that time the shadow grows narrower, as the ring appears to do to us; until, by Saturn's annual motion, the sun comes to the plane of the ring, or even with its edge; which being then directed towards us, becomes invisible on account of its thinness; as shall be explained afterwards. The ring disappears twice in every annual revolution of Saturn, namely, when he is in the 19th degree both of Pisces and of Virgo. And when Saturn is in the middle between these points, or in the 19th degree either of Gemini or of Sagittarius, his ring appears most open to us; and then its longest diameter is to its shortest, as 9 to 4.\n\nTo such eyes as ours, unassisted by instruments, Jupiter is the only planet that can be seen from Saturn, and Saturn the only planet that can be seen from Jupiter. So that the inhabitants of these two planets must either see much farther than we do, or have equally good instruments to carry their sight to remote objects, if they know that there is such a body as our earth in the universe: For the earth is no bigger, nor from Jupiter, than his moons are seen from the earth; and if his large body had not first attracted our sight, and prompted our curiosity to view him with the telescope, we should never have known anything of his moons; unless by chance we had directed the telescope toward that small part of the heavens where they were at the time of observation. And the like is true of the moons of Saturn.\n\nThe orbit of Saturn is 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) degrees inclined to the ecliptic, or orbit of our earth, and intersects it in the 21st degree of Cancer and of Capricorn; so that Saturn's nodes are only 14 degrees from Jupiter's.\n\nThe quantity of light, afforded by the sun to Jupiter, being but \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\)th part, and to Saturn only \\( \\frac{1}{9} \\)th part, of what we enjoy, may, at first thought, induce us to believe that these two planets are entirely unfit for rational beings to dwell upon. But, that their light is not so weak as we imagine, is evident from their brightness in the night-time; and also from this remarkable phenomenon, that when the sun is so much eclipsed to us, as to have only the 40th part of his disk left uncovered by the moon, the decrease of light is not very sensible; and just at the end of darkness in total eclipses, when his western limb begins to be visible, and seems no bigger than a bit of fine silver wire, every one is surprised at the brightness wherewith that small part of him shines. The moon, when full, affords travellers light enough to keep them from mistaking their way; and yet, according to Dr Smith, it is equal to no more than a 90 thousandth part of the light of the sun: That is, the sun's light is 90 thousand times as strong as the light of the moon when full. Consequently, the sun gives a thousand times as much light to Saturn as the full moon does to us; and above three thousand times as much to Jupiter. So that these two planets, even without any moons, would be much more enlightened than we at first imagine; and by having so many, they may be very comfortable places of residence. Their heat, so far as it depends on the force of the sun's rays, is certainly much less than ours; to which no doubt the bodies of their inhabitants are as well adapted as ours are to the seasons we enjoy. And if we consider, that Jupiter never has any winter, even at his poles, which probably is also the case with Saturn, the cold cannot be so intense on these two planets as is generally imagined. Besides, there may be something in their nature or soil much warmer than\nthan in that of our earth: And we find that all our heat depends not on the rays of the sun; for if it did, we should always have the same months equally hot or cold at their annual returns. But it is far otherwise, for February is sometimes warmer than May; which must be owing to vapours and exhalations from the earth.\n\nEvery person who looks upon, and compares the systems of moons together, which belong to Jupiter and Saturn, must be amazed at the vast magnitude of these two planets, and the noble attendance they have in respect of our little earth; and can never bring himself to think, that an infinitely wise Creator should dispose of all his animals and vegetables here, leaving the other planets bare and destitute of rational creatures. To suppose that he had any view to our benefit, in creating these moons, and giving them their motions round Jupiter and Saturn; to imagine that he intended these vast bodies for any advantage to us, when he well knew that they could never be seen but by a few astronomers peeping through telescopes; and that he gave to the planets regular returns of days and nights, and different seasons to all where they would be convenient; but of no manner of service to us, except only what immediately regards our own planet the earth; to imagine that he did all this on our account, would be charging him impiously with having done much in vain; and as absurd, as to imagine that he has created a little sun and a planetary system within the shell of our earth, and intended them for our use. These considerations amount to little less than a positive proof, that all the planets are inhabited: For if they are not, why all this care in furnishing them with so many moons, to supply those with light which are at the greater distances from the sun? Do we not see, that the farther a planet is from the sun, the greater apparatus it has for that purpose? save only Mars, which being but a small planet, may have moons too small to be seen by us. We know that the earth goes round the sun, and turns round its own axis, to produce the vicissitudes of summer and winter by the former, and of day and night by the latter motion, for the benefit of its inhabitants. May we not then fairly conclude, by parity of reason, that the end and design of all the other planets is the same? and is not this agreeable to the beautiful harmony which exists throughout the universe?\n\nIn fig. 2, we have a view of the proportional breadth of the sun's face or disk, as seen from the different planets. The sun is represented, No. 1, as seen from Mercury; No. 2, as seen from Venus; No. 3, as seen from the earth; No. 4, as seen from Mars; No. 5, as seen from Jupiter; and No. 6, as seen from Saturn.\n\nLet the circle B (fig. 3,) be the sun as seen from any planet, at a given distance; to another planet, at double that distance, the sun will appear just half that breadth, as A, which contains only one fourth part of the area, or surface of B. For all circles, as well as square surfaces, are to one another as the squares of their diameters. Thus, (fig. 4,) the square A is just half as broad as the square B; and yet it is plain to sight, that B contains four times as much surface as A. Hence, by comparing the diameters of the above circles (fig. 2,) together, it will be found, that, in round numbers, the sun appears 7 times larger to Mercury than to us, 90 times larger to us than to Saturn, and 630 times as large to Mercury as to Saturn.\n\nIn fig. 5, we have a view of the bulks of the planets in proportion to each other, and to a supposed globe of two feet diameter for the sun. The earth is 27 times as big as Mercury, very little bigger than Venus, five times as big as Mars; but Jupiter is 1049 times as big as the earth; Saturn 586 times as big, exclusive of his ring; and the sun is 877 thousand 650 times as big as the earth. If the planets in this figure were set at their due distances from a sun of two feet diameter, according to their proportional bulks, as in our system, Mercury would be 28 yards from the sun's centre; Venus 51 yards 1 foot; the earth 70 yards 2 feet; Mars 107 yards 2 feet; Jupiter 370 yards 2 feet; and Saturn 760 yards two feet; the comet of the year 1680, at its greatest distance, 10 thousand 760 yards. In this proportion, the moon's distance from the centre of the earth would be only 7\u00bd inches.\n\nTo assist the imagination in forming an idea of the vast distances of the sun, planets, and stars, let us suppose, that a body projected from the sun should continue to fly with the swiftness of a cannon-ball, i.e., 480 miles every hour; this body would reach the orbit of Mercury, in 7 years 221 days; of Venus, in 14 years 8 days; of the earth, in 19 years 91 days; of Mars, in 29 years 85 days; of Jupiter, in 100 years 280 days; of Saturn, in 184 years 240 days; to the comet of 1680, at its greatest distance from the sun, in 2660 years; and to the nearest fixed stars, in about 7 million 600 thousand years.\n\nAs the earth is not the centre of the orbits in which the planets move, they come nearer to it and go farther from it, and at different times; on which account they appear bigger and less by turns. Hence, the apparent magnitudes of the planets are not always a certain rule to know them by.\n\nUnder fig. 3, are the names and characters of the twelves signs of the zodiac, which the reader should be perfectly well acquainted with, so as to know the characters without seeing the names. Every sign contains 30 degrees, as in the circle bounding the solar system; to which the characters of the signs are set in their proper places.\n\nThe Comets are solid opaque bodies, with long transparent trains or tails, issuing from that side which is turned away from the sun. They move about the sun in very eccentric ellipses; and are of a much greater density than the earth; for some of them are heated in every period to such a degree, as would vitrify or dissipate any substance known to us. Sir Isaac Newton computed the heat of the comet which appeared in the year 1680, when nearest the sun, to be 2000 times hotter than red-hot iron; and that, being thus heated, it must retain its heat until it comes round again, although its period should be more than twenty thousand years; and it is computed to be only 575.\n\nPart of the paths of three comets are delineated in the scheme of the solar system, and the years marked in which they made their appearance. It is believed\nthat there are at least 21 comets belonging to our system, moving in all sorts of directions; and all those which have been observed, have moved through the etherial regions and the orbits of the planets without suffering the least sensible resistance in their motions; which plainly proves that the planets do not move in solid orbs. Of all the comets, the periods of the above mentioned three only are known with any degree of certainty. The first of these comets appeared in the years 1531, 1607, and 1682; was expected to appear again in the year 1758, and every 75th year afterwards. The second of them appeared in 1532 and 1661, and may be expected to return in 1789, and every 129th year afterwards. The third, having last appeared in 1680, and its period being no less than 575 years, cannot return until the year 2225.\n\nThis comet, at its greatest distance, is about 11 thousand two hundred millions of miles from the sun; and at its least distance from the sun's centre, which is 490,000 miles, is within less than a third part of the sun's semi-diameter from his surface. In that part of its orbit which is nearest the sun, it flies with the amazing swiftness of 880,000 miles in an hour; and the sun, as seen from it, appears an hundred degrees in breadth, consequently 40 thousand times as large as he appears to us. The astonishing length that this comet runs out into empty space, suggests to our minds an idea of the vast distance between the sun and the nearest fixed stars; of whose attractions all the comets must keep clear to return periodically, and go round the sun; and it thaws us also, that the nearest stars, which are probably those that seem the largest, are as big as our sun, and of the same nature with him; otherwise they could not appear so large and bright to us as they do at such an immense distance.\n\nThe extreme heat, the dense atmosphere, the gross vapours, the chaotic state of the comets, seem at first sight to indicate them altogether unfit for the purposes of animal life, and a most miserable habitation for rational beings; and therefore some are of opinion that they are so many hells for tormenting the damned with perpetual vicissitudes of heat and cold. But when we consider, on the other hand, the infinite power and goodness of the Deity, the latter inclining, and the former enabling him to make creatures suited to all states and circumstances; that matter exists only for the sake of intelligent beings; and that where-ever we find it, we always find it pregnant with life, or necessarily subservient thereto; the numberless species, the affording diversity of animals in earth, air, water, and even on other animals; every blade of grass, every leaf, every fluid swarming with life; and every one of these enjoying such gratifications as the nature and state of each requires: When we reflect moreover, that some centuries ago, till experience undeceived us, a great part of the earth was judged uninhabitable, the torrid zone by reason of excessive heat, and the frigid zones because of their intolerable cold; it seems highly probable, that such numerous and large masses of durable matter as the comets are, however unlike they be to our earth, are not destitute of beings capable of contemplating with wonder, and acknowledging with gratitude, the wisdom, symmetry, and beauty of the creation; which is more plainly to be observed in their extensive tour through the heavens, than in our more confined circuit. If farther conjecture is permitted, may we not suppose them instrumental in recruiting the expanded fuel of the sun, and supplying the exhausted moisture of the planets? However difficult it may be, circumstanced as we are, to find out their particular delineation, this is an undoubted truth, that wherever the Deity exerts his power, there he also manifests his wisdom and goodness.\n\nThe solar system here described is not a late invention, for it was known and taught by the wise Samian philosopher Pythagoras, and others among the ancients; but in latter times was lost, till the 15th century, when it was again restored by the famous Polish philosopher, Nicholas Copernicus, who was born at Thorn in the year 1473. In this he was followed by the greatest mathematicians and philosophers that have since lived; as Kepler, Galileo, Descartes, Gassendus, and Sir Isaac Newton; the last of whom has established this system on such a foundation of mathematical and physical demonstration, as can never be shaken.\n\nIn the Ptolemaic system, the earth was supposed to be fixed in the centre of the universe; and that the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, moved round the earth: Above the planets this hypothesis placed the firmament of stars, and then the two crystalline spheres; all which were included in and received motion from the primum mobile, which constantly revolved about the earth in 24 hours from east to west. But as this rude scheme was found incapable to stand the test of art and observation, it was soon rejected by all true philosophers.\n\nThe Tychonic system succeeded the Ptolemaic, but was never so generally received. In this the earth was supposed to stand still in the centre of the universe or firmament of stars, and the sun to revolve about it every 24 hours; the planets, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, going round the sun in the times already mentioned. But some of Tycho's disciples supposed the earth to have a diurnal motion round its axis, and the sun, with all the above planets, to go round the earth in a year; the planets moving round the sun in the foresaid times. This hypothesis, being partly true, and partly false, was embraced by few; and soon gave way to the only true and rational scheme, restored by Copernicus, and demonstrated by Sir Isaac Newton.\n\n**Chap. III. The Phenomena of the Heavens as seen from different Parts of the Earth.**\n\nWe are kept to the earth's surface on all sides by the power of its central attraction; which, laying hold of all bodies according to their densities or quantities of matter, without regard to their bulks, constitutes what we call their weight. And having the sky over our heads, go where we will, and our feet towards the centre of the earth, we call it up over our heads, and down under our feet: Although the same right line which is down to us, if continued through, and beyond the opposite side of the\nearth, would be up to the inhabitants on the opposite side. For, the inhabitants n, i, e, m, s, o, q, l, (Plate XXXIX. fig. 6.) stand with their feet towards the earth's centre C; and have the same figure of sky, N, I, E, M, S, O, Q, L over their heads. Therefore the point S is as directly upward to the inhabitant (s) on the south pole, as N is to the inhabitant n on the north pole; so is E to the inhabitant e, supposed to be on the north end of Peru; and Q to the opposite inhabitant q on the middle of the island of Sumatra. Each of these observers is surprised that his opposite or antipode can stand with his head hanging downwards. But let either go to the other, and he will tell him that he stood as upright and firm upon the place where he was, as he now stands where he is. To all these observers, the sun, moon, and stars, seem to turn round the points N and S, as the poles of the fixed axis NCS; because the earth does really turn round the mathematical line NC as round an axis, of which n is the north pole, and s the south pole. The inhabitant U (Plate XL. fig. 1.) affirms that he is on the uppermost side of the earth, and wonders how another at L can stand on the undermost side with his head hanging downwards. But U, in the meantime, forgets that in twelve hours time he will be carried half round with the earth, and then be in the very situation that L now is, although as far from him as before. And yet, when U comes there, he will find no difference as to his manner of standing; only he will see the opposite half of the heavens, and imagine the heavens to have gone half round the earth.\n\nWhen we see a globe hung up in a room, we cannot help imagining it to have an upper and an under side, and immediately form a like idea of the earth; from whence we conclude, that it is as impossible for people to stand on the under side of the earth, as for pebbles to lie on the under side of a common globe, which instantly fall down from it to the ground; and well they may, because the attraction of the earth, being greater than the attraction of the globe, pulls them away. Just so would be the case with our earth, if it were placed near a globe much bigger than itself, such as Jupiter; for then it would really have an upper and an under side, with respect to that large globe; which, by its attraction, would pull away every thing from the side of the earth next to it; and only those on the top of the opposite or upper side could remain upon it. But there is no larger globe near enough our earth to overcome its central attraction; and therefore it has no such thing as an upper and an under side; for all bodies, on or near its surface, even to the moon, gravitate towards its centre.\n\nThe earth's bulk is but a point, as that at C, compared to the heavens; and therefore every inhabitant upon it, let him be where he will, as at n, e, m, s, &c., sees half of the heavens. The inhabitant n, on the north pole of the earth, constantly sees the hemisphere ENQ; and having the north pole N of the heavens just over his head, his horizon coincides with the celestial equator BCQ. Therefore, all the stars in the northern hemisphere ENQ, between the equator and north pole, appear to turn round the line NC, moving parallel to the horizon. The equatorial stars keep in the horizon, and all those in the southern hemisphere ESQ are invisible. The like phenomena are seen by the observer (s) on the south pole, with respect to the hemisphere ESQ; and to him the opposite hemisphere is always invisible. Hence, under either pole, only half of the heavens is seen; for those parts which are once visible never set, and those which are once invisible never rise. But the ecliptic YCX, or orbit which the sun appears to describe once a year by the earth's annual motion, has the half YC constantly above the horizon ECQ of the north pole n; and the other half CX always below it. Therefore, whilst the sun describes the northern half YC of the ecliptic, he neither sets to the north pole, nor rises to the south; and whilst he describes the southern half CX, he neither sets to the south pole nor rises to the north. The same things are true with respect to the moon; only with this difference, that as the sun describes the ecliptic but once a year, he is for half that time visible to each pole in its turn, and as long invisible; but as the moon goes round the ecliptic in 27 days 8 hours, she is only visible for 13 days 16 hours, and as long invisible to each pole by turns. All the planets likewise rise and set to the poles, because their orbits are cut obliquely in halves by the horizon of the poles. When the sun (in his apparent way from X) arrives at C, which is on the 20th of March, he is just rising to an observer n on the north pole, and setting to another at s on the south pole. From C he rises higher and higher in every apparent diurnal revolution, till he comes to the highest point of the ecliptic y, on the 21st of June, and then he is at his greatest altitude, which is $23\\frac{1}{2}$ degrees, or the arc Ey, equal to his greatest north declination; and from thence he seems to descend gradually in every apparent circumvolution, till he sets at C on the 23rd of September; and then he goes to exhibit the like appearances at the south pole for the other half of the year. Hence, the sun's apparent motion round the earth is not in parallel circles, but in spirals; such as might be represented by a thread wound round a globe from tropic to tropic; the spirals being at some distance from one another about the equator, and gradually nearer to each other as they approach toward the tropics.\n\nIf the observer be any where on the terrestrial equator eCq, as suppose at e, he is in the plane of the celestial equator; or under the equinoctial BCQ; and the axis of the earth nCs is coincident with the plane of his horizon, extended out to N and S, the north and south poles of the heavens. As the earth turns round the line NCS, the whole heavens MOLI seem to turn round the same line, but the contrary way. It is plain that this observer has the celestial poles constantly in his horizon; and that his horizon cuts the diurnal paths of all the celestial bodies perpendicularly and in halves. Therefore the sun, planets and stars, rise every day, and ascend perpendicularly above the horizon for six hours; and, passing over the meridian, descend in the same manner for the six following hours; then set in the horizon, and continue twelve hours below it. Consequently at the equator the days and nights are equally long throughout the year. When the observer is in the situation e, he sees the hemisphere SEN; but in twelve hours after, he\nhe is carried half round the earth's axis to q, and then the hemisphere SQN becomes visible to him; and SEN disappears. Thus we find, that to an observer at either of the poles, one half of the sky is always visible, and the other half never seen; but to an observer on the equator, the whole sky is seen every 24 hours.\n\nThe figure here referred to, represents a celestial globe of glass, having a terrestrial globe within it; after the manner of the glass-sphere invented by Dr Long, Lowndes's professor of astronomy in Cambridge.\n\nIf a globe be held sidewise to the eye, at some distance, and so that neither of its poles can be seen, the equator ECL, and all circles parallel to it, as DL, yzx, abX, MO, &c. will appear to be straight lines, as projected in this figure; which is requisite to be mentioned here, because we shall have occasion to call them circles in the following articles of this chapter.\n\nLet us now suppose that the observer has gone from the equator towards the north pole N, and that he stops at i, from which place he then sees the hemisphere MEINL; his horizon MCL having shifted as many degrees from the celestial poles N and S, as he has travelled from under the equinoctial E. And as the heavens seem constantly to turn round the line NC'S as an axis, all those stars which are not so many degrees from the north pole N as the observer is from the equinoctial, namely, the stars north of the dotted parallel DL, never set below the horizon; and those which are south of the dotted parallel MO never rise above it. Hence the former of these two parallel circles is called the circle of perpetual apparition, and the latter the circle of perpetual occultation; but all the stars between these two circles rise and set every day. Let us imagine many circles to be drawn between these two, and parallel to them; those which are on the north side of the equinoctial will be unequally cut by the horizon MCL, having larger portions above the horizon than below it; and the more so, as they are nearer to the circle of perpetual apparition; but the reverse happens to those on the south side of the equinoctial, whilst the equinoctial is divided in two equal parts by the horizon. Hence, by the apparent turning of the heavens, the northern stars describe greater arcs or portions of circles above the horizon than below it; and the greater, as they are farther from the equinoctial towards the circle of perpetual apparition; whilst the contrary happens to all stars south of the equinoctial; but those upon it describe equal arcs both above and below the horizon, and therefore they are just as long above as below it.\n\nAn observer on the equator has no circle of perpetual apparition or occultation, because all the stars, together with the sun and moon, rise and set to him every day. But, as a bare view of the figure is sufficient to show that these two circles DL and MO are just as far from the poles N and S as the observer at i (or one opposite to him at o) is from the equator ECL, it is plain, that if an observer begins to travel from the equator towards either pole, his circle of perpetual apparition rises from that pole as from a point, and his circle of perpetual occultation from the other. As the observer advances toward the nearer pole, these two circles enlarge their diameters, and come nearer one another, until he comes to the pole; and then they meet and coincide in the equinoctial. On different sides of the equator, to observers at equal distances from it, the circle of perpetual apparition to one is the circle of perpetual occultation to the other.\n\nBecause the stars never vary their distances from the equinoctial, so as to be sensible in an age, the lengths of their diurnal and nocturnal arcs are always the same to the same places on the earth. But as the earth goes round the sun every year in the ecliptic, one half of which is on the north side of the equinoctial, and the other half on its south side, the sun appears to change his place every day, so as to go once round the circle YCX every year. Therefore whilst the sun appears to advance northward, from having described the parallel abX touching the ecliptic in X, the days continually lengthen and the nights shorten, until he comes to y and describes the parallel yzx, when the days are at the longest and the nights at the shortest; for then, as the sun goes no farther northward, the greatest portion that is possible of the diurnal arc yz is above the horizon of the inhabitant i, and the smallest portion zx below it. As the sun declines southward from y, he describes smaller diurnal and greater nocturnal arcs, or portions of circles every day; which causeth the days to shorten and nights to lengthen, until he arrives again at the parallel abX; which having only the small part ab above the horizon MCL, and the great part bX below it, the days are at the shortest and the nights at the longest; because the sun recedes no farther south, but returns northward as before. It is easy to see that the sun must be in the equinoctial ECL twice every year, and then the days and nights are equally long; that is, 12 hours each. These hints serve at present to give an idea of some of the appearances resulting from the motions of the earth; which will be more particularly described in the tenth chapter.\n\nTo an observer at either pole, the horizon and equinoctial are coincident; and the sun and stars seem to move parallel to the horizon; therefore, such an observer is said to have a parallel position of the sphere. To an observer anywhere between either pole and equator, the parallels described by the sun and stars are cut obliquely by the horizon, and therefore he is said to have an oblique position of the sphere. To an observer anywhere on the equator, the parallels of motion, described by the sun and stars, are cut perpendicularly, or at right angles, by the horizon; and therefore he is said to have a right position of the sphere. And these three are all the different ways that the sphere can be pointed to all people on the earth.\n\nCHAP. IV. The Phenomena of the Heavens as seen from different parts of the Solar System.\n\nSo vastly great is the distance of the starry heavens, that if viewed from any part of the solar system, or even many\nmany millions of miles beyond it, its appearance would be the very same to us. The sun and stars would all seem to be fixed on one concave surface, of which the spectator's eye would be the centre. But the planets being much nearer than the stars, their appearances will vary considerably with the place from which they are viewed.\n\nIf the spectator is at rest without their orbits, the planets will seem to be at the same distance as the stars, but continually changing their places with respect to the stars and to one another, assuming various phases of increase and decrease like the moon; and, notwithstanding their regular motions about the sun, will sometimes appear to move quicker, sometimes slower, be as often to the west as to the east of the sun, and at their greatest distances seem quite stationary. The duration, extent, and distance of those points in the heavens where these digressions begin and end, would be more or less, according to the respective distances of the several planets from the sun; but in the same planet they would continue invariably the same at all times; like pendulums of unequal lengths oscillating together, the shorter move quick and go over a small place, the longer move slow and go over a large space. If the observer is at rest within the orbits of the planets, but not near the common centre, their apparent motions will be irregular, but less so than in the former case. Each of the several planets will appear larger and less by turns, as they approach nearer or recede farther from the observer, the nearest varying most in their size. They will also move quicker or slower with regard to their fixed stars, but will never be retrograde or stationary.\n\nIf an observer in motion views the heavens, the same apparent irregularities will be observed, but with some variation resulting from its own motion. If he is on a planet which has a rotation on its axis, not being sensible of his own motion, he will imagine the whole heavens, sun, planets, and stars, to revolve about him in the same time that his planet turns round, but the contrary way, and will not be easily convinced of the deception. If his planet moves round the sun, the same irregularities and aspects as above mentioned will appear in the motions of the other planets; and the sun will seem to move among the fixed stars or signs, directly opposite to those in which his planet moves, changing its place every day as he does. In a word, whether our observer be in motion or at rest, whether within or without the orbits of the planets, their motions will seem irregular, intricate, and perplexed, unless he is in the centre of the system; and from thence the most beautiful order and harmony will be seen by him.\n\nThe sun being the centre of all the planets' motions, the only place from which their motions could be truly seen is the sun's centre; where the observer, being supposed not to turn round with the sun, (which, in this case, we must imagine to be a transparent body), would see all the stars at rest, and seemingly equidistant from him. To such an observer, the planets would appear to move among the fixed stars, in a simple, regular, and uniform manner; only, that as in equal times they describe equal areas, they would describe spaces somewhat unequal, because they move in elliptic orbits. Their motions would also appear to be what they are in fact, the same way round the heavens, in paths which cross at small angles in different parts of the heavens, and then separate a little from one another; so that if the solar astronomer should make the path or orbit of any one planet a standard, and consider it as having no obliquity, he would judge the paths of all the rest to be inclined to it, each planet having one half of its path on one side, and the other half on the opposite side of the standard path or orbit. And if he should ever see all the planets start from a conjunction with each other, Mercury would move so much faster than Venus, as to overtake her again (though not in the same point of the heavens) in a quantity of time almost equal to 145 of our days and nights, or, as we commonly call them, natural days, which include both the days and nights; Venus would move so much faster than the earth, as to overtake it again in 585 natural days; the earth so much faster than Mars, as to overtake him again in 773 such days; Mars so much faster than Jupiter, as to overtake him again in 817 such days; and Jupiter so much faster than Saturn, as to overtake him again in 7236 days, all of our time.\n\nBut as our solar astronomer could have no idea of measuring the courses of the planets by our days, he would probably take the period of Mercury, which is the quickest moving planet, for a measure to compare the periods of the others by. As all the stars would appear quiet to him, he would never think that they had any dependence upon the sun; but would naturally imagine that the planets have, because they move round the sun. And it is by no means improbable, that he would conclude those planets whose periods are quickest, to move in orbits proportionably less than those which make slower circuits. But being destitute of a method for finding their parallaxes, or, more properly speaking, as they could have no parallax to him, he could never know anything of their real distances or magnitudes. Their relative distances he might perhaps guess at by their periods, and from thence infer something of truth concerning their relative bulk, by comparing their apparent bulks with one another. For example, Jupiter appearing bigger to him than Mars, he would conclude it to be much bigger in fact; because it appears so, and must be farther from him on account of its longer period. Mercury and the earth would seem much of the same bulk; but, by comparing its period with the earth's, he would conclude that the earth is much farther from him than Mercury, and consequently that it must be really larger, though apparently of the same bulk; and so of the rest. And as each planet would appear somewhat larger in one part of its orbit than in the opposite, and to move quicker when it seems biggest, the observer would be at no loss to determine that all the planets move in orbits, of which the sun is not precisely in the centre.\n\nThe apparent magnitudes of the planets continually change as seen from the earth; which demonstrates that they approach nearer to it, and recede farther from it by turns. From these phenomena, and their apparent motions among the stars, they seem to describe looped curves which never return into themselves, Venus's path excepted.\nexcepted. And if we were to trace out all their apparent paths, and put the figures of them together in one diagram, they would appear so anomalous and confused, that no man in his senses could believe them to be representations of their real paths; but would immediately conclude, that such apparent irregularities must be owing to some optic illusions: And after a good deal of inquiry, he might perhaps be at a loss to find out the true cause of these inequalities; especially if he were one of those who would rather, with the greatest justice, charge frail man with ignorance, than the Almighty with being the author of such confusion.\n\nDr Long, in his first volume of Astronomy, has given us figures of the apparent paths of all the planets separately from Cassini; from them Mr Ferguson first thought of attempting to trace some of them by an orrery, that shews the motions of the sun, Mercury, Venus, the earth, and moon, according to the Copernican system. Having taken off the sun, Mercury, and Venus, he put black lead pencils in their places, with the points turned upward, and fixed a circular sheet of pasteboard so that the earth kept constantly under its centre in going round the sun, and the pasteboard kept its parallelism. Then, pressing gently with one hand upon the pasteboard to make it touch the three pencils, with the other hand he turned the winch that moves the whole machinery: and as the earth together with the pencils in the places of Mercury and Venus had their proper motions round the sun's pencils, which kept at rest in the centre of the machine, all the three pencils described a diagram, from which fig. 2. of Plate XL. is truly copied in a smaller size. As the earth moved round the sun, the sun's pencil described the dotted circle of months, whilst Mercury's pencil drew the curve with the greatest number of loops, and Venus's that with the fewest. In their inferior conjunctions they come as much nearer the earth, or within the circle of the sun's apparent motion round the heavens, as they go beyond it in their superior conjunctions. On each side of the loops they appear stationary; in that part of each loop next the earth retrograde; and in all the rest of their paths direct.\n\nIf Cassini's figures of the paths of the sun, Mercury, and Venus, were put together, the figure as above traced out would be exactly like them. It represents the sun's apparent motion round the ecliptic, which is the same every year; Mercury's motion for seven years, and Venus's for eight; in which time Mercury's path makes 23 loops, crizzling itself so many times, and Venus's only five. In eight years, Venus falls so nearly into the same apparent path again, as to deviate very little from it in some ages; but in what number of years Mercury and the rest of the planets would describe the same visible paths over again, it is hard to determine. Having finished the above figure of the paths of Mercury and Venus, he put the ecliptic round them as in the Doctor's book, and added the dotted lines from the earth to the ecliptic for shewing Mercury's apparent or geocentric motion therein for one year; in which time his path makes three loops, and goes on a little farther; which shews that he has three inferior, and as many superior conjunctions with the sun in that time; and also that he is six times stationary, and thrice retrograde. Let us now trace his motion for one year in the figure.\n\nIn Plate XL. fig. 2. suppose Mercury to be setting out from A towards B, (between the earth and left hand corner of the Plate), and as seen from the earth, his motion will then be direct, or according to the order of the signs. But when he comes to B, he appears to stand still in the 23rd degree of Taurus at F, as shown by the line BF. Whilst he goes from B to C, the line BF, supposed to move with him, goes backward from F to E, or contrary to the order of signs; and when he is at C, he appears stationary at E, having gone back 11\u00bd degrees. Now, suppose him stationary on the first of January at C, on the roth thereof he will appear in the heavens as at D, near F; on the 20th, he will be seen as at G; on the 31st, at H; on the 10th of February, at I; on the 20th, at K; and on the 28th, at L; as the dotted lines show, which are drawn through every tenth day's motion in his looped path, and continued to the ecliptic. On the 10th of March, he appears at M; on the 20th, at N; and on the 31st, at O. On the 10th of April, he appears stationary at P; on the 20th, he seems to have gone back again to O; and on the 30th, he appears stationary at Q, having gone back 11\u00bd degrees. Thus Mercury seems to go forward 4 signs 11 degrees, or 131 degrees, and to go back only 11 or 12 degrees, at a mean rate. From the 30th of April to the 10th of May, he seems to move from Q to R; and on the 20th, he is seen at S, going forward in the same manner again, according to the order of letters; and backward when they go back; which it is needless to explain any farther, as the reader can trace him out so easily through the rest of the year. The same appearances happen in Venus's motion; but as she moves slower than Mercury, there are longer intervals of time between them.\n\n**Chap. V. The physical Causes of the Motions of the Planets. The Eccentricities of their Orbits. The Times in which the Action of Gravity alone would bring them to the Sun.**\n\nFrom the uniform projectile motion of bodies in straight lines, and the universal power of attraction which draws them off from these lines, the curvilinear motions of all the planets arise. In Plate XL. fig. 3, if the body A be projected along the right line ABX, in open space, where it meets with no resistance, and is not drawn aside by any other power, it will forever go on with the same velocity, and in the same direction. For the force which moves it from A to B in any given time, will carry it from B to X in as much more time, and so on, there being nothing to obstruct or alter its motion. But if when this projectile force has carried it, suppose to B, the body S begins to attract it, with a power duly adjusted, and perpendicular to its motion at B, it will then be drawn from the straight line ABX, and forced to revolve about S in the circle BITU. When the body A comes to U, or any other part of its orbit, if the small body u, within the sphere\nof U's attraction, be projected as in the right line Z, with a force perpendicular to the attraction of U, then u will go round U in the orbit W, and accompany it in its whole course round the body S. Here S may represent the sun, U the earth, and u the moon.\n\nIf a planet at B gravitates, or is attracted toward the sun so as to fall from B to y in the time that the projectile force would have carried it from B to X; it will describe the curve BY by the combined action of these two forces, in the same time that the projectile force singly would have carried it from B to X, or the gravitating power singly have caused it to descend from B to y; and these two forces being duly proportioned, and perpendicular to one another, the planet obeying them both, will move in the circle BYTU.\n\nBut if, whilst the projectile force carries the planet from B to b, the sun's attraction (which constitutes the planet's gravitation) should bring it down from B to I, the gravitating power would then be too strong for the projectile force, and would cause the planet to describe the curve BC. When the planet comes to C, the gravitating power (which always increases as the square of the distance from the sun S diminishes) will be yet stronger for the projectile force; and by conspiring in some degree therewith, will accelerate the planet's motion all the way from C to K, causing it to describe the arcs, BC, CD, DE, EF, &c., all in equal times. Having its motion thus accelerated, it thereby gains so much centrifugal force, or tendency to fly off at K in the line Kk, as overcomes the sun's attraction; and the centrifugal force being too great to allow the planet to be brought nearer the sun, or even to move round him in the circle Klmn, &c., it goes off, and ascends in the curve KLMN, &c. Its motion decreasing as gradually from K to B, as it increased from B to K, because the sun's attraction acts now against the planet's projectile motion just as much as it acted with it before. When the planet has got round to B, its projectile force is as much diminished from its mean state about G or N, as it was augmented at K; and so, the sun's attraction being more than sufficient to keep the planet from going off at B, it describes the same orbit over again, by virtue of the same forces or powers.\n\nA double projectile force will always balance a quadruple power of gravity. Let the planet at B have twice as great an impulse from thence towards X, as it had before; that is, in the same length of time that it was projected from B to b, as in the last example, let it now be projected from B to c, and it will require four times as much gravity to retain it in its orbit; that is, it must fall as far as from B to q in the time that the projectile force would carry it from B to c, otherwise it could not describe the curve BD, as is evident by the figure. But in as much time as the planet moves from B to C in the higher part of its orbit, it moves from I to K, or from K to L, in the lower part thereof; because, from the joint action of these two forces, it must always describe equal areas in equal times, throughout its annual course. These areas are represented by the triangles BSC, CSD, DSE, ESF, &c., whose contents are equal to one another, quite round the figure.\n\nAs the planets approach nearer the sun, and recede farther from him in every revolution, there may be some difficulty in conceiving the reason why the power of gravity, when it once gets the better of the projectile force, does not bring the planets nearer and nearer the sun in every revolution, till they fall upon and unite with him; or why the projectile force, when it once gets the better of gravity, does not carry the planets farther and farther from the sun, till it removes them quite out of the sphere of his attraction, and causes them to go on in straight lines for ever afterward. But by considering the effects of these powers, this difficulty will be removed. Suppose a planet at B to be carried by the projectile force as far as from B to b, in the time that gravity would have brought it down from B to I; by these two forces it will describe the curve BC. When the planet comes down to K, it will be but half as far from the sun S as it was at B; and therefore, by gravitating four times as strongly towards him, it would fall from K to V in the same length of time that it would have fallen from B to I in the higher part of its orbit, that is, through four times as much space; but its projectile force is then so much increased at K, as would carry it from K to k in the same time; being double of what it was at B, and is therefore too strong for the gravitating power, either to draw the planet to the sun, or cause it to go round him in the circle Klmn, &c., which would require its falling from K to w, through a greater space than gravity can draw it, whilst the projectile force is such as would carry it from K to k; and therefore the planet ascends in its orbit KL MN, decreasing in its velocity, for the cause already assigned.\n\nThe orbits of all the planets are ellipses, very little different from circles; but the orbits of the comets are very long ellipses, and the lower focus of them all is in the sun. If we suppose the mean distance (or middle between the greatest and least) of every planet and comet from the sun to be divided into 1000 equal parts, the eccentricities of their orbits, both in such parts and in English miles, will be as follow. Mercury's 210 parts, or 6,720,000 miles; Venus's, 7 parts, or 413,000 miles; the earth's, 17 parts, or 1,377,000 miles; Mars's, 93 parts, or 11,439,000 miles; Jupiter's, 48 parts, or 20,352,000 miles; Saturn's, 55 parts, or 42,735,000 miles. Of the nearest of the three aforementioned comets, 1,458,000 miles; of the middlemost, 2,025,000,000 miles; and of the outermost, 6,600,000,000.\n\nBy the laws of gravity and the projectile force, bodies will move in all kinds of ellipses, whether long or short, if the spaces they move in be void of resistance; only those which move in the longer ellipses, have so much the less projectile force impressed upon them in the higher parts of their orbits; and their velocities in coming down towards the sun are so prodigiously increased by his attraction, that their centrifugal forces in the lower parts of their orbits are so great, as to overcome the sun's attraction there, and cause them to ascend again towards the higher parts of their orbits; during which time, the sun's attraction acting so contrary to the motions of these bodies, causes them to move slower and slower, until\ntheir projectile forces are diminished almost to nothing; and then they are brought back again by the sun's attraction, as before.\n\nIf the projectile forces of all the planets and comets were destroyed at their mean distances from the sun, their gravities would bring them down so, that Mercury would fall to the sun in 15 days 13 hours; Venus, in 39 days 17 hours; the earth or moon, in 64 days 10 hours; Mars, in 121 days; Jupiter, in 290; and Saturn, in 767. The nearest comet, in 13 thousand days; the middlemost, in 23 thousand days; and the outermost, in 66 thousand days. The moon would fall to the earth in 4 days 20 hours: Jupiter's first moon would fall to him in 7 hours; his second, in 15; his third, in 30; and his fourth, in 71 hours: Saturn's first moon would fall to him in 8 hours; his second, in 12; his third, in 19; his fourth, in 68; and the fifth, in 336. A stone would fall to the earth's centre, if there were an hollow passage, in 21 minutes 9 seconds. Mr Whiston gives the following rule for such computations. \"It is demonstrable, that half the period of any planet, when it is diminished in the sesquialteral proportion of the number 1 to the number 2, or nearly in the proportion of 1000 to 2828, is the time that it would fall to the centre of its orbit.\" This proportion is, when a quantity or number contains another once and a half as much more.\n\nThe quick motions of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn round their primaries, demonstrate that these two planets have stronger attractive powers than the earth has: for the stronger that one body attracts another, the greater must be the projectile force, and consequently the quicker must be the motion of that other body to keep it from falling to its primary or central planet. Jupiter's second moon is 124 thousand miles farther from Jupiter than our moon is from us; and yet this second moon goes almost eight times round Jupiter whilst our moon goes only once round the earth. What a prodigious attractive power must the sun then have, to draw all the planets and satellites of the system towards him; and what an amazing power must it have required to put all these planets and moons into such rapid motions at first!\n\n**Chap. VI. Reasons why the Sun, Moon, and Stars, when rising or setting, appear larger than when they rise higher in the Heavens.**\n\nThe sun and moon appear larger in the horizon than at any considerable height above it. These luminaries, although at great distances from the earth, appear floating, as it were, on the surface of our atmosphere, (Plate XLII, fig. 1.) HCFeG, a little way beyond the clouds; of which, those about F, directly over our heads at E, are nearer us than those about H or e in the horizon HEC. Therefore, when the sun or moon appear in the horizon at e, they are not only seen in a part of the sky which is really farther from us than if they were at any considerable altitude, as about f; but they are also seen through a greater quantity of air and vapours at e than at f. Here we have two concurring appearances which deceive our imagination, and cause us to refer the sun and moon to a greater distance at their rising or setting about e, than when they are considerably high, as at f: first, their seeming to be on a part of the atmosphere at e, which is really farther than f from a spectator at E; and, secondly, their being seen through a groser medium when at e than when at f, which, by rendering them dimmer, causes us to imagine them to be at a yet greater distance. And as, in both cases, they are seen much under the same angle, we naturally judge them to be largest when they seem farthest from us.\n\nAny one may satisfy himself that the moon appears under no greater angle in the horizon than on the meridian, by taking a large sheet of paper, and rolling it up in the form of a tube, of such a width, that observing the moon through it when she rises, she may, as it were, just fill the tube; then tie a thread round it to keep it of that size; and when the moon comes to the meridian, and appears much less to the eye, look at her again through the same tube, and she will fill it just as much, if not more, than she did at her rising.\n\nWhen the full moon is in her perigee, or at her least distance from the earth, she is seen under a larger angle, and must therefore appear bigger that when she is full at other times: And if that part of the atmosphere where she rises be more replete with vapours than usual, she appears so much the dimmer; and therefore we fancy her to be still the bigger, by referring her to an unusually great distance, knowing that no objects which are very far distant can appear big unless they be really so.\n\n**Chap. VII. Use of the common Quadrant, and the Method of finding the Distances of the Sun, Moon, and Planets.**\n\nTo enable the young astronomer to understand the method of finding the distances of the heavenly bodies, we shall here give a short description of the quadrant. This instrument (Plate XLV, fig. 6.) is chiefly used in taking altitudes:\n\nThe altitude of any celestial phenomenon is an arc of the sky intercepted between the horizon and the phenomenon. In fig. 6. of Plate XLV, let HOX be a horizontal line, supposed to be extended from the eye at A to X, where the sky and earth seem to meet at the end of a long and level plain; and let S be the sun. The arc XY will be the sun's height above the horizon at X; and is found by the instrument EDG, which is a quadrantal board, or plate of metal, divided into 90 equal parts or degrees on its limb DPG; and has a couple of little brass plates, as a and b, with a small hole in each of them, called sight-holes, for looking through, parallel to the edge of the quadrant whereon they stand. To the centre E is fixed one end of a thread F, called the plumb-line, which has a small weight or plummet P fixed to its other end. Now, if an observer holds the quadrant upright, without inclining it to either side, and so that the horizon at X is seen through the sight-holes a and b, the plumb-line will cut or hang over the beginning of the degrees\ndegrees at \\( O \\), in the edge \\( EC \\); but if he elevates the quadrant so as to look through the sight-holes at any part of the heavens, suppose to the sun at \\( S \\); just so many degrees as he elevates the sight-hole \\( b \\) above the horizontal line \\( HOX \\), so many degrees will the plumb-line cut in the limb \\( CP \\) of the quadrant. For, let the observer's eye at \\( A \\) be in the centre of the celestial arc \\( XIV \\) (and he may be said to be in the centre of the sun's apparent diurnal orbit, let him be on what part of the earth he will) in which arc the sun is at that time, suppose 25 degrees high, and let the observer hold the quadrant so that he may see the sun through the sight-holes; the plumb-line freely playing on the quadrant will cut the 25th degree in the limb \\( GP \\), equal to the number of degrees of the sun's altitude at the time of observation.\n\n[N.B. Whoever looks at the sun, must have a smoked glass before his eyes to save them from hurt. The better way is not to look at the sun through the sight-holes, but to hold the quadrant facing the eye, at a little distance, and so that the sun shining through one hole, the ray may be seen to fall on the other.]\n\nIn fig. 2. Plate XLI. let \\( BAC \\) be one half of the earth, \\( AC \\) its semidiameter, \\( S \\) the sun, \\( m \\) the moon, and \\( EKOL \\) a quarter of the circle described by the moon in revolving from the meridian to the meridian again. Let \\( CRS \\) be the rational horizon of an observer at \\( A \\), extended to the sun in the heavens; and \\( HAO \\) his sensible horizon, extended to the moon's orbit. \\( ALC \\) is the angle under which the earth's semidiameter \\( AC \\) is seen from the moon at \\( L \\), which is equal to the angle \\( OAL \\), because the right lines \\( AO \\) and \\( CL \\) which include both these angles are parallel. \\( ASC \\) is the angle under which the earth's semidiameter \\( AC \\) is seen from the sun at \\( S \\), and is equal to the angle \\( OAF \\), because the lines \\( AO \\) and \\( CRS \\) are parallel. Now, it is found by observation, that the angle \\( OAL \\) is much greater than the angle \\( OAF \\); but \\( OAL \\) is equal to \\( ALC \\), and \\( OAF \\) is equal to \\( ASC \\). Now, as \\( ASC \\) is much less than \\( ALC \\), it proves that the earth's semidiameter \\( AC \\) appears much greater as seen from the moon at \\( L \\), than from the sun at \\( S \\); and therefore the earth is much farther from the sun than from the moon. The quantities of these angles are determined by observation in the following manner.\n\nLet a graduated instrument, as \\( DAE \\) (the larger the better) having a moveable index with sight-holes, be fixed in such a manner, that its plane surface may be parallel to the plane of the equator, and its edge \\( AD \\) in the meridian: so that when the moon is in the equinoctial, and on the meridian at \\( E \\), she may be seen through the sight-holes when the edge of the moveable index cuts the beginning of the divisions at \\( O \\), on the graduated limb \\( DE \\); and when she is so seen, let the precise time be noted. Now, as the moon revolves about the earth, from the meridian to the meridian again, in 24 hours 48 minutes, she will go a fourth part round it in a fourth part of that time, viz. in 6 hours 12 minutes, as seen from \\( C \\), that is, from the earth's centre or pole. But as seen from \\( A \\), the observer's place on the earth's surface, the moon will seem to have gone a quarter round the earth when she comes to the sensible horizon at \\( O \\); for the index, through the sights of which she is then viewed, will be at \\( d \\), 90 degrees from \\( D \\), where it was when she was seen at \\( E \\). Now, let the exact moment when the moon is seen at \\( O \\) (which will be when she is in or near the sensible horizon) be carefully noted, that it may be known in what time she has gone from \\( E \\) to \\( O \\); which time subtracted from 6 hours 12 minutes (the time of her going from \\( E \\) to \\( L \\)) leaves the time of her going from \\( O \\) to \\( L \\), and affords an easy method for finding the angle \\( OAL \\) (called the moon's horizontal parallax, which is equal to the angle \\( ALC \\)) by the following analogy. As the time of the moon's describing the arc \\( EO \\) is to 90 degrees, so is 6 hours 12 minutes to the degrees of the arc \\( DdE \\), which measures the angle \\( EAL \\); from which subtract 90 degrees, and there remains the angle \\( OAL \\), equal to the angle \\( ALC \\), under which the earth's semidiameter \\( AC \\) is seen from the moon. Now, since all the angles of a right-lined triangle are equal to 180 degrees, or to two right angles, and the sides of a triangle are always proportional to the sines of the opposite angles, say, by the Rule of Three, as the sine of the angle \\( ALC \\) at the moon \\( L \\) is to its opposite side \\( AC \\), the earth's semidiameter, which is known to be 3985 miles, so is the radius, viz. the sine of 90 degrees, or of the right angle \\( AGL \\), to its opposite side \\( AL \\), which is the moon's distance at \\( L \\), from the observer's place at \\( A \\), on the earth's surface; or, so is the sine of the angle \\( CAL \\) to its opposite side \\( CL \\), which is the moon's distance from the earth's centre, and comes out, at a mean rate, to be 240,000 miles. The angle \\( CAL \\) is equal to what \\( OAL \\) wants of 90 degrees.\n\nThe sun's distance from the earth is found the same way, but with much greater difficulty; because his horizontal parallax, or the angle \\( OAS \\) equal to the angle \\( ASC \\), is so small as to be hardly perceptible, being only 10 seconds of a minute, or the 360th part of a degree. But the moon's horizontal parallax, or angle \\( OAL \\), equal to the angle \\( ALC \\), is very discernible, being 57\u00b0 49\u2032, or 3459\u2033 at its mean state; which is more than 340 times as great as the sun's: And therefore the distances of the heavenly bodies being inversely as the tangents of their horizontal parallaxes, the sun's distance from the earth is at least 340 times as great as the moon's; and is rather understated at 81 millions of miles, when the moon's distance is certainly known to be 240 thousand. But because, according to some astronomers, the sun's horizontal parallax is 11 seconds, and according to others only 10, the former parallax making the sun's distance to be about 75,000,000 of miles, and the latter 82,000,000; we may take it for granted, that the sun's distance is not less than as deduced from the former, nor more than as shown by the latter: And every one who is accustomed to make such observations, knows how hard it is, if not impossible, to avoid an error of a second, especially on account of the inconstancy of horizontal refractions: And here, the error of one second, in so small an angle, will make an error of seven millions of miles in so great a distance as that of the sun's.\n\nThe sun and moon appear much about the same bulk; and every one who understands geometry, knows how their true bulks may be deduced from the apparent, when their real distances are known. Spheres are to one another\nanother as the cubes of their diameters; whence, if the sun be 81 millions of miles from the earth, to appear as big as the moon, whose distance does not exceed 240 thousand miles, he must, in solid bulk, be 42 millions 875 thousand times as big as the moon.\n\nThe horizontal parallaxes are best observed at the equator. 1. Because the heat is so nearly equal every day, that the refractions are almost constantly the same. 2. Because the parallactic angle is greater there, as at A (the distance from thence to the earth's axis being greater) than upon any parallel of latitude, as a or b.\n\nThe earth's distance from the sun being determined, the distances of all the other planets from him are easily found by the following analogy, their periods round him being ascertained by observation. As the square of the earth's period round the sun is to the cube of its distance from him, so is the square of the period of any other planet to the cube of its distance, in such parts or measures as the earth's distance was taken. This proportion gives us the relative mean distances of the planets from the sun to the greatest degree of exactness; and they are as follow, having been deduced from their periodical times, according to the law just mentioned, which was discovered by Kepler, and demonstrated by Sir Isaac Newton.\n\nPeriodical Revolution to the same fixed Star in Days, and decimal Parts of a Day.\n\n| Of Mercury | Venus | The Earth | Mars | Jupiter | Saturn |\n|------------|-------|-----------|------|---------|--------|\n| 87.9692   | 224.6176 | 365.2564 | 686.9785 | 4332.514 | 10759.275 |\n\nRelative mean distances from the sun.\n\n| 38710 | 72333 | 100000 | 152369 | 520096 | 954006 |\n\nFrom these numbers we deduce, that if the sun's horizontal parallax be 10\", the real mean distances of the planets from the sun in English miles are,\n\n| 31,742,200 | 59,313,060 | 82,000,000 | 124,942,580 | 426,478,720 | 782,284,920 |\n\nBut if the sun's parallax be 11\", their distances are no more than\n\n| 29,032,500 | 54,238,570 | 75,000,000 | 114,276,750 | 390,034,500 | 715,504,500 |\n\nErrors in distance, arising from the mistake of 1\" in the sun's parallax.\n\n| 2,709,700 | 5,074,490 | 7,000,000 | 10,665,830 | 36,444,220 | 66,780,420 |\n\nBut, from the transit of Venus, A.D. 1761, the sun's parallax appears to be only 8\" 1/80; and according to that, their real distance in miles are\n\n| 36,668,373 | 68,518,044 | 94,725,840 | 144,588,575 | 492,665,307 | 903,690,197 |\n\nThese numbers shew, that although we have the relative distances of the planets from the sun to the greatest nicety, yet the best observers could not ascertain their true distances, until the above transit appeared, which we must confess was embarrassed with several difficulties. But the late transit of Venus over the sun, on the third of June, was much better suited to this great problem.\n\nThe earth's axis produced to the stars, being carried parallel to itself during the earth's annual revolution, describes a circle in the sphere of the fixed stars equal to the orbit of the earth. But this orbit, though very large, would seem no bigger than a point if it were viewed from the stars; and consequently, the circle described in the sphere of the stars, by the axis of the earth produced, if viewed from the earth, must appear but as a point; that is, its diameter appears too little to be measured by observation: For Dr Bradley has assured us, that if it had amounted to a single second, or two at most, he should have perceived it in the great number of observations he has made, especially upon \u03b3 draconis; and that it seemed to him very probable that the annual parallax of this star is not so great as a single second; and consequently, that it is above 400 thousand times farther from us than the sun. Hence, the celestial poles seem to continue in the same points of the heavens throughout the year; which, by no means, disproves the earth's annual motion, but plainly proves the distance of the stars to be exceeding great.\n\nThe small apparent motion of the stars, discovered by that great astronomer, he, found to be no ways owing to their annual parallax (for it came out contrary thereto) but to the aberration of their light, which can result from no known cause besides that of the earth's annual motion; and as it agrees so exactly therewith, it proves, beyond dispute, that the earth has such a motion: For this aberration completes all its various phenomena every year; and proves that the velocity of star-light is such as carries it through a space equal to the sun's distance from us in 8 minutes 13 seconds of time. Hence, the velocity of light is 10 thousand 210 times as great as the earth's velocity in its orbit; which velocity (from what we know already of the earth's distance from the sun) may be asserted to be at least between 57 and 58 thousand miles every hour: And supposing it to be 58000, this number, multiplied by the above 10210, gives 592 million 180 thousand miles for the hourly motion of light; which last number, divided by 3600, the number of seconds in an hour, shews that light flies at the rate of more than a hundred and sixty-four thousand miles every second of time, or swing of a common clock pendulum.\nCHAP. VIII. The different Lengths of Days and Nights, and the Vicissitudes of Seasons, explained. The Explanation of the Phenomena of Saturn's Ring concluded.\n\nThe following experiment will give a plain idea of the diurnal and annual motions of the earth, together with the different lengths of days and nights, and all the beautiful variety of seasons, depending on those motions.\n\nTake about seven feet of strong wire, and bend it into a circular form, as abcd, which being viewed obliquely, appears elliptical, Plate XLII. fig. 3. Place a lighted candle on a table, and having fixed one end of a silk thread K, to the north pole of a small terrestrial globe H, about three inches diameter, cause another person to hold the wire circle, so that it may be parallel to the table, and as high as the flame of the candle I, which should be in or near the centre. Then, having twisted the thread as towards the left-hand, that by untwisting it may turn the globe round eastward, or contrary to the way that the hands of a watch move; hang the globe by the thread within this circle, almost contiguous to it; and as the thread untwists, the globe (which is enlightened half round by the candle as the earth is by the sun) will turn round its axis, and the different places upon it will be carried through the light and dark hemispheres, and have the appearance of a regular succession of days and nights, as our earth has in reality by such a motion. As the globe turns, move your hand slowly, so as to carry the globe round the candle according to the order of the letters abcd, keeping its centre even with the wire circle; and you will perceive, that the candle being still perpendicular to the equator, will enlighten the globe from pole to pole in its whole motion round the circle; and that every place on the globe goes equally through the light and the dark, as it turns round by the untwisting of the thread, and therefore has a perpetual equinox. The globe, thus turning round, represents the earth turning round its axis; and the motion of the globe round the candle represents the earth's annual motion round the sun, and shows, that if the earth's orbit had no inclination to its axis, all the days and nights of the year would be equally long, and there would be no different seasons. But now, define the person who holds the wire, to hold it obliquely in the position ABCD, raising the side F just as much as he depresses the side R, that the flame may be still in the plane of the circle; and twisting the thread as before, that the globe may turn round its axis the same way as you carry it round the candle, that is, from west to east, let the globe down into the lowermost part of the wire circle at R, and if the circle be properly inclined, the candle will shine perpendicularly on the tropic of Cancer, and the frigid zone, lying within the arctic or north polar circle, will be all in the light, as in the figure; and will keep in the light, let the globe turn round its axis ever so often. From the equator to the north polar circle all the places have longer days and shorter nights; but from the equator to the south polar circle just the reverse. The sun does not set to any part of the north frigid zone, as shown by the candle's shining on it, so that the motion of the globe can carry no place of that zone into the dark: And, at the same time, the fourth frigid zone is involved in darkness, and the turning of the globe brings none of its places into the light. If the earth were to continue in the like part of its orbit, the sun would never set to the inhabitants of the north frigid zone, nor rise to those of the south. At the equator it would be always equal day and night; and as places are gradually more and more distant from the equator, towards the arctic circle, they would have longer days and shorter nights; whilst those on the south side of the equator would have their nights longer than their days. In this case there would be continual summer on the north side of the equator, and continual winter on the south side of it.\n\nBut as the globe turns round its axis, move your hand slowly forward, so as to carry the globe from H towards E, and the boundary of light and darkness will approach towards the north pole, and recede towards the south pole; the northern places will go through less and less of the light, and the southern places through more and more of it; shewing how the northern days decrease in length, and the southern days increase, whilst the globe proceeds from H to E. When the globe is at E, it is at a mean state between the lowest and highest part of its orbit; the candle is directly over the equator, the boundary of light and darkness just reaches to both the poles, and all places on the globe go equally through the light and dark hemispheres, shewing that the days and nights are then equal at all places of the earth, the poles only excepted; for the sun is then setting to the north pole, and rising to the south pole.\n\nContinue moving the globe forward, and as it goes thro' the quarter A, the north pole recedes still farther into the dark hemisphere, and the south pole advances more into the light, as the globe comes nearer to F: And when it comes there at F, the candle is directly over the tropic of Capricorn, the days are at the shortest, and nights at the longest, in the northern hemisphere, all the way from the equator to the arctic circle; and the reverse in the southern hemisphere from the equator to the antarctic circle; within which circles it is dark to the north frigid zone, and light to the south.\n\nContinue both motions, and as the globe moves through the quarter B, the north pole advances towards the light, and the south pole recedes towards the dark; the days lengthen in the northern hemisphere, and shorten in the southern; and when the globe comes to G, the candle will be again over the equator (as when the globe was at E) and the days and nights will again be equal as formerly; and the north pole will be just coming into the light, the south pole going out of it.\n\nThus we see the reason why the days lengthen and shorten from the equator to the polar circles every year; why there is no day or night for several turnings of the earth, within the polar circles; why there is but one day and one night in the whole year at the poles; and why the days and nights are equally long all the year.\nyear round at the equator, which is always equally cut by the circle bounding light and darkness.\n\nThe inclination of an axis or orbit is merely relative, because we compare it with some other axis or orbit which we consider as not inclined at all. Thus, our horizon being level to us whatever place of the earth we are upon, we consider it as having no inclination; and yet, if we travel 90 degrees from that place, we shall then have an horizon perpendicular to the former, but it will still be level to us. And if this book be held so that the circle \\(ABCD\\) be parallel to the horizon, both the circle abcd, and the thread or axis \\(K\\), will be inclined to it. But if the book or plate be held so that the thread be perpendicular to the horizon, then the orbit \\(ABCD\\) will be inclined to the thread, and the orbit abcd perpendicular to it, and parallel to the horizon. We generally consider the earth's annual orbit as having no inclination, and the orbits of all the other planets as inclined to it.\n\nLet us now take a view of the earth in its annual course round the sun, considering its orbit as having no inclination, and its axis as inclining \\(23^\\circ 16'\\) degrees from a line perpendicular to the plane of its orbit, and keeping the same oblique direction in all parts of its annual course; or, as commonly termed, keeping always parallel to itself.\n\nIn Plate XLI, fig. 4, let \\(abcde\\) be the earth in eight different parts of its orbit, equidistant from one another, \\(N\\) its axis, \\(N'\\) the north pole, \\(S\\) the south pole, and \\(S'\\) the sun nearly in the centre of the earth's orbit. As the earth goes round the sun according to the order of the letters \\(abcd\\), &c., its axis \\(N\\) keeps the same obliquity, and is still parallel to the line \\(MN'S\\). When the earth is at \\(a\\), its north pole inclines toward the sun \\(S\\), and brings all the northern places more into the light than at any other time of the year. But when the earth is at \\(e\\) in the opposite time of the year, the north pole declines from the sun, which occasions the northern places to be more in the dark than in the light; and the reverse at the southern places, as is evident by the figure. When the earth is either at \\(c\\) or \\(g\\), its axis inclines not either to or from the sun, but lies sidewise to him, and then the poles are in the boundary of light and darkness; and the sun, being directly over the equator, makes equal day and night at all places. When the earth is at \\(b\\), it is half way between the summer solstice and harvest equinox; when it is at \\(d\\), it is half way from the harvest equinox to the winter solstice; at \\(f\\), half way from the winter solstice to the spring equinox; and at \\(h\\), half way from the spring equinox to the summer solstice.\n\nFrom this oblique view of the earth's orbit, let us suppose ourselves to be raised far above it, and placed just over its centre \\(S\\); looking down upon it from its north pole; and as the earth's orbit differs but very little from a circle, we shall have its figure in such a view represented by the circle \\(ABCDEFGH\\) (Plate XLII, fig. 1.). Let us suppose this circle to be divided into 12 equal parts, called signs, having their names affixed to them; and each sign into 30 equal parts, called degrees, numbered 10, 20, 30, as in the outermost circle of the figure, which represents the great ecliptic in the heavens. The earth is shown in eight different positions in this circle, and in each position \\(AE\\) is the equator, \\(T\\) the tropic of Cancer, the dotted circle the parallel of London, \\(U\\) the arctic or north polar circle, and \\(P\\) the north pole, where all the meridians or hour-circles meet. As the earth goes round the sun, the north pole keeps constantly towards one part of the heavens, as it keeps in the figure towards the right-hand side of the plate.\n\nWhen the earth is at the beginning of Libra, namely, on the 20th of March, in this figure (as at \\(g\\) in Plate XLI, fig. 4.) the sun \\(S\\) as seen from the earth appears at the beginning of Aries in the opposite part of the heavens, the north pole is just coming into the light, and the sun is vertical to the equator; which, together with the tropic of Cancer, parallel of London, and arctic circle, are all equally cut by the circle bounding light and darkness, coinciding with the six o'clock hour-circle, and therefore the days and nights are equally long at all places; for every part of the meridian \\(AE\\) comes into the light at six in the morning, and revolving with the earth according to the order of the hour-letters, goes into the dark at six in the evening. There are 24 meridians or hour-circles drawn on the earth in this figure, to show the time of sun-rising and setting at different seasons of the year.\n\nAs the earth moves in the ecliptic according to the order of the letters \\(ABCD\\), &c., through the signs Libra, Scorpio, and Sagittarius, the north pole comes more and more into the light; the days increase as the nights decrease in length, at all places north of the equator \\(AE\\); which is plain by viewing the earth at \\(b\\) on the 5th of May, when it is in the 15th degree of Scorpio, and the sun as seen from the earth appears in the 15th degree of Taurus; for then the tropic of Cancer \\(T\\) is in the light from a little after five in the morning till almost seven in the evening; the parallel of London from half an hour past four till half an hour past seven; the polar circle \\(U\\) from three till nine; and a large track round the north pole \\(P\\) has day all the 24 hours, for many rotations of the earth on its axis.\n\nWhen the earth comes to \\(c\\) at the beginning of Capricorn; and the sun as seen from the earth appears at the beginning of Cancer on the 21st of June, as in this figure, it is in the position \\(a\\) in Plate XLI, fig. 4.; and its north pole inclines towards the sun, so as to bring all the north frigid zone into the light, and the northern parallels of latitude more into the light than the dark from the equator to the polar circle, and the more so as they are farther from the equator. The tropic of Cancer is in the light from five in the morning till seven at night; the parallel of London from a quarter before four till a quarter after eight; and the polar circle just touches the dark, so that the sun has only the lower half of his disk hid from the inhabitants on that circle for a few minutes about midnight, supposing no inequalities in the horizon, and no refractions.\n\nA bare view of the figure is enough to show, that as the earth advances from Capricorn towards Aries, and the sun appears to move from Cancer towards Libra, the north pole recedes towards the dark, which causes the days to decrease, and the nights to increase in length, till...\ntill the earth comes to the beginning of Aries, and then they are equal as before; for the boundary of light and darkness cut the equator and all its parallels equally or in halves. The north pole then goes into the dark, and continues therein until the earth goes half way round its orbit, or from the 23rd of September till the 20th of March. In the middle between these times, viz. on the 23rd of December, the north pole is as far as it can be in the dark, which is $23\\frac{1}{2}$ degrees, equal to the inclination of the earth's axis from a perpendicular to its orbit; and then the northern parallels are as much in the dark as they were in the light on the 21st of June; the winter nights being as long as the summer days, and the winter days as short as the summer nights. It is needless to enlarge farther on this subject, as we shall have occasion to mention the seasons again in describing the orrery. Only this must be noted, that all that has been said of the northern hemisphere, the contrary must be understood of the southern; for on different sides of the equator the seasons are contrary, because when the northern hemisphere inclines towards the sun, the southern declines from him.\n\nAs Saturn goes round the sun, his obliquely posted ring, like our earth's axis, keeps parallel to itself, and is therefore turned edgewise to the sun twice in a Saturnian year, which is almost as long as 30 of our years. But the ring, though considerably broad, is too thin to be seen by us when it is turned round edgewise to the sun, at which time it is also edgewise to the earth, and therefore it disappears once in every fifteen years to us. As the sun shines half a year together on the north pole of our earth, then disappears to it, and shines as long on the south pole; so, during one half of Saturn's year, the sun shines on the north side of his ring, then disappears to it, and shines as long on its south side. When the earth's axis inclines neither to nor from the sun, but sidewise to him, he instantly ceases to shine on one pole, and begins to enlighten the other; and when Saturn's ring inclines neither to nor from the sun, but sidewise to him, he ceases to shine on the one side of it, and begins to shine upon the other.\n\nThe earth's orbit being elliptical, and the sun constantly keeping in its lower focus, which is 1,377,000 miles from the middle point of the longer axis, the earth comes twice so much, or 2,754,000 miles nearer the sun at one time of the year than at another; for the sun appearing under a larger angle in our winter than summer, proves that the earth is nearer the sun in winter. But here this natural question will arise, Why have we not the hottest weather when the earth is nearest the sun? In answer, it must be observed, that the eccentricity of the earth's orbit, or 1 million 377 miles, bears no greater proportion to the earth's mean distance from the sun than 17 does to 1000; and therefore this small difference of distance cannot occasion any great difference of heat or cold. But the principal cause of this difference is, that in winter the sun's rays fall so obliquely upon us, that any given number of them is spread over a much greater portion of the earth's surface where we live, and therefore each point must then have fewer rays than in summer. Moreover, there comes a greater degree of cold in the long winter nights than there can return of heat in so short days; and on both these accounts the cold must increase. But in summer, the rays fall more perpendicularly upon us, and therefore come with greater force, and in greater numbers on the same place; and by their long continuance, a much greater degree of heat is imparted by day than can fly off by night.\n\n**CHAP. IX. The Method of finding the Longitude by the Eclipses of Jupiter's Satellites: The amazing Velocity of Light demonstrated by these Eclipses.**\n\nGeographers arbitrarily choose to call the meridian of some remarkable place the first meridian. There they begin their reckoning; and just so many degrees and minutes as any other place is to the eastward or westward of that meridian, so much east or west longitude they say it has. A degree is the 360th part of a circle, be it great or small; and a minute the 60th part of a degree. The English geographers reckon the longitude from the meridian of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, and the French from the meridian of Paris.\n\nIf we imagine 12 great circles, (Plate XLII. fig. 1.) one of which is the meridian of any given place, to intersect each other in the two poles of the earth, and to cut the equator $\\theta$ at every 15th degree, they will be divided by the poles into 24 semicircles which divide the equator into 24 equal parts; and as the earth turns on its axis, the planes of these semicircles come successively after one another every hour to the sun. As in an hour of time there is a revolution of 15 degrees of the equator, in a minute of time there will be a revolution of 15 minutes of the equator, and in a second of time a revolution of 15 seconds.\n\nBecause the sun enlightens only one half of the earth at once, as it turns round its axis, he rises to some places at the same moments of absolute time that he sets to others; and when it is mid-day to some places, it is midnight to others. The XII on the middle of the earth's enlightened side, next the sun, stands for mid-day; and the opposite XII on the middle of the dark side, for midnight. If we suppose this circle of hours to be fixed in the plane of the equinoctial, and the earth to turn round within it, any particular meridian will come to the different hours so as to show the true time of the day or night at all places on that meridian. Therefore,\n\nTo every place 15 degrees eastward from any given meridian, it is noon an hour sooner than on that meridian, because their meridian comes to the sun an hour sooner; and to all places 15 degrees westward, it is noon an hour later, because their meridian comes an hour later to the sun, and so on; every 15 degrees of motion causing an hour's difference in time. Therefore, they who have noon an hour later than we, have their meridian, that is, their longitude, 15 degrees westward from us; and they who have noon an hour sooner than we, have their meridian 15 degrees eastward from ours; and so for every hour's difference of time 15 degrees differ-\nAstronomy\n\nConsequently, if the beginning or ending of a lunar eclipse be observed, suppose at London, to be exactly at midnight, and in some other place at 11 at night, that place is 15 degrees westward from the meridian of London; if the same eclipse be observed at 1 in the morning at another place, that place is 15 degrees eastward from the said meridian.\n\nBut as it is not easy to determine the exact moment either of the beginning or ending of a lunar eclipse, because the earth's shadow, through which the moon passes, is faint and ill-defined about the edges, we have recourse to the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites, which disappear so instantaneously as they enter Jupiter's shadow, and emerge so suddenly out of it, that we may fix the phenomenon to half a second of time. The first or nearest satellite to Jupiter is the most advantageous for this purpose, because its motion is quicker than the motion of any of the rest, and therefore its immersions and emergences are more frequent.\n\nThe English astronomers have calculated tables for shewing the times of the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites to great precision, for the meridian of Greenwich. Now, let an observer, who has these tables, with a good telescope and a well-regulated clock at any other place of the earth, observe the beginning or ending of an eclipse of one of Jupiter's satellites, and note the precise moment of time that he saw the satellite either immerse into, or emerge out of the shadow, and compare that time with the time shown by the tables for Greenwich; then, 15 degrees difference of longitude being allowed for every hour's difference of time, will give the longitude of that place from Greenwich, as above; and if there be any odd minutes of time, for every minute a quarter of a degree, east or west, must be allowed, as the time of observation is later or earlier than the time shown by the tables. Such eclipses are very convenient for this purpose at land, because they happen almost every day; but are of no use at sea, because the rolling of the ship hinders all nice telescopical observations.\n\nTo explain this by a figure, in Plate XLII, fig. 1, let J be Jupiter, K, L, M, N his four satellites in their respective orbits, 1, 2, 3, 4; and let the earth be at f, (suppose in November, although that month is no otherwise material than to find the earth readily in this scheme, where it is shown in eight different parts of its orbit). Let Q be a place on the meridian of Greenwich, and R a place on some other meridian eastward from Greenwich. Let a person at R observe the instantaneous vanishing of the first satellite K into Jupiter's shadow, suppose at three o'clock in the morning; but by the tables he finds the immersion of that satellite to be at midnight at Greenwich; he can then immediately determine, that as there are three hours difference of time between Q and R; and that R is three hours forwarder in reckoning than Q, it must be 45 degrees of east longitude from the meridian of Q. Were this method as practicable at sea as at land, any sailor might almost as easily, and with equal certainty, find the longitude as the latitude.\n\nWhilst the earth is going from G to F in its orbit, only the immersions of Jupiter's satellites into his shadow are generally seen; and their emergences out of it while the earth goes from G to B. Indeed, both these appearances may be seen of the second, third, and fourth satellite when eclipsed, whilst the earth is between D and E, or between G and A; but never of the first satellite, on account of the smallness of its orbit and the bulk of Jupiter, except only when Jupiter is directly opposite to the sun, that is, when the earth is at g; and even then, strictly speaking, we cannot see either the immersions or emergences of any of his satellites, because his body being directly between us and his conical shadow, his satellites are hid by his body a few moments before they touch his shadow; and are quite emerged from thence before we can see them, as it were, just dropping from him. And when the earth is at c, the sun, being between it and Jupiter, hides both him and his moons from us.\n\nIn this diagram, the orbits of Jupiter's moons are drawn in true proportion to his diameter; but, in proportion to the earth's orbit, they are drawn 81 times too large.\n\nIn whatever month of the year Jupiter is in conjunction with the sun, or in opposition to him, in the next year it will be a month later at least. For whilst the earth goes once round the sun, Jupiter describes a twelfth part of his orbit. And therefore, when the earth has finished its annual period, from being in a line with the sun and Jupiter, it must go as much farther as Jupiter has moved in that time, to overtake him again; just like the minute-hand of a watch, which must, from any conjunction with the hour-hand, go once round the dial-plate and somewhat above a twelfth part more, to overtake the hour-hand again.\n\nIt is found by observation, that when the earth is between the sun and Jupiter, as at g, his satellites are eclipsed about 8 minutes sooner than they should be according to the tables; and when the earth is at B or C, these eclipses happen about 8 minutes later than the tables predict them. Hence it is undeniably certain, that the motion of light is not instantaneous, since it takes about 16\u00bd minutes of time to go through a space equal to the diameter of the earth's orbit, which is 162 millions of miles in length; and consequently the particles of light fly about 164 thousand 494 miles every second of time, which is above a million of times swifter than the motion of a cannon-bullet. And as light is 16\u00bd minutes in travelling across the earth's orbit, it must be 8\u00bd minutes in coming from the sun to us; therefore if the sun were annihilated, we should see him for 8\u00bd minutes after; and if he were again created, he would be 8\u00bd minutes old before we could see him.\n\nTo illustrate this progressive motion of light, (Plate XLII, fig. 2.), let A and B be the earth in two different parts of its orbit, whose distance from each other is 81 millions of miles, equal to the earth's distance from the sun S. It is plain, that if the motion of light were instantaneous, the satellite 1 would appear to enter into Jupiter's shadow FF at the same moment of time to a spectator in A, as to another in B. But by many years observations it has been found, that the immersion of the satellite into the shadow is seen 8\u00bd minutes sooner when the earth is at B, than when it is at A. And so, as\nMr. Romeur first discovered, the motion of light is thereby proved to be progressive, and not instantaneous, as was formerly believed. It is easy to compute in what time the earth moves from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\); for the chord of 60 degrees of any circle is equal to the semidiameter of that circle; and as the earth goes through all the 360 degrees of its orbit in a year, it goes through 60 of those degrees in about 61 days. Therefore, if on any given day, suppose the first of June, the earth is at \\( A \\), on the first of August it will be at \\( B \\); the chord, or straight line \\( AB \\), being equal to \\( DS \\) the radius of the earth's orbit, the same with \\( AS \\) its distance from the sun.\n\nAs the earth moves from \\( D \\) to \\( C \\), through the side \\( AB \\) of its orbit, it is constantly meeting the light of Jupiter's satellites sooner, which occasions an apparent acceleration of their eclipses; and as it moves through the other half \\( H \\) of its orbit, from \\( C \\) to \\( D \\), it is receding from their light, which occasions an apparent retardation of their eclipses, because their light is then longer before it overtakes the earth.\n\nThat these accelerations of the immersions of Jupiter's satellites into his shadow, as the earth approaches towards Jupiter, and the retardations of their emergences out of his shadow, as the earth is going from him, are not occasioned by any inequality arising from the motions of the satellites in eccentric orbits, is plain, because it affects them all alike, in whatever parts of their orbits they are eclipsed. Besides, they go often round their orbits every year, and their motions are no way commensurate to the earth's. Therefore, a phenomenon not to be accounted for from the real motions of the satellites, but so easily deducible from the earth's motion, and so answerable thereto, must be allowed to result from it. This affords one very good proof of the earth's annual motion.\n\n**Chap. X. Of Solar and Sydereal Time.**\n\nThe fixed stars appear to go round the earth in 23 hours 56 minutes 4 seconds, and the sun in 24 hours; so that the stars gain three minutes 56 seconds upon the sun every day, which amounts to one diurnal revolution in a year; and therefore, in 365 miles, as measured by the returns of the sun to the meridian, there are 366 days, as measured by the stars returning to it; the former are called solar days, and the latter sydereal.\n\nThe diameter of the earth's orbit is but a physical point in proportion to the distance of the stars; for which reason, and the earth's uniform motion on its axis, any given meridian will revolve from any star to the same star again in every absolute turn of the earth on its axis, without the least perceptible difference of time shewn by a clock which goes exactly true.\n\nIf the earth had only a diurnal motion, without an annual, any given meridian would revolve from the sun to the star again in the same quantity of time as from any star to the same star again, because the sun would never change his place with respect to the stars. But as the earth advances almost a degree eastward in its orbit in the time that it turns eastward round its axis, whatever star passes over the meridian on any day with the sun, will pass over the same meridian on the next day when the sun is almost a degree short of it; that is, 3 minutes 56 seconds sooner. If the year contained only 360 days, as the ecliptic does 360 degrees, the sun's apparent place, so far as his motion is equable, would change a degree every day; and then the sydereal days would be just four minutes shorter than the solar.\n\nIn Plate XLII. fig. 3, let \\( ABCDEFGHIKLM \\) be the earth's orbit, in which it goes round the sun every year, according to the order of the letters, that is, from west to east; and turns round its axis the same way from the sun to the sun again every 24 hours. Let \\( S \\) be the sun, and \\( R \\) a fixed star, at such an immense distance, that the diameter of the earth's orbit bears no sensible proportion to that distance. Let \\( Nm \\) be any particular meridian of the earth, and \\( N \\) a given point or place upon that meridian. When the earth is at \\( A \\), the sun \\( S \\) hides the star \\( R \\), which would always be hid if the earth never removed from \\( A \\); and consequently, as the earth turns round its axis, the point \\( N \\) would always come round to the sun and star at the same time. But when the earth has advanced, suppose a twelfth part of its orbit from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\), its motion round its axis will bring the point \\( N \\) a twelfth part of a natural day, or two hours, sooner to the star than to the sun; for the angle \\( NBn \\) is equal to the angle \\( ASB \\); and therefore any star, which comes to the meridian at noon with the sun when the earth is at \\( A \\), will come to the meridian at 10 in the forenoon when the earth is at \\( B \\). When the earth comes to \\( C \\), the point \\( N \\) will have the star on its meridian at 8 in the morning, or four hours sooner than it comes round to the sun; for it must revolve from \\( N \\) to \\( n \\), before it has the sun in its meridian. When the earth comes to \\( D \\), the point \\( N \\) will have the star on its meridian at 6 in the morning, but that point must revolve six hours more from \\( N \\) to \\( n \\), before it has mid-day by the sun: For now the angle \\( ASD \\) is a right angle, and so is \\( NDn \\); that is, the earth has advanced 90 degrees in its orbit, and must turn 90 degrees on its axis to carry the point \\( N \\) from the star to the sun: For the star always comes to the meridian when \\( Nm \\) is parallel to \\( RSA \\); because \\( DS \\) is but a point in respect of \\( RS \\). When the earth is at \\( E \\), the star comes to the meridian at 4 in the morning; at \\( F \\), at 2 in the morning; and at \\( G \\), the earth having gone half round its orbit, \\( N \\) points to the star \\( R \\) at midnight, it being then directly opposite to the sun; and therefore, by the earth's diurnal motion, the star comes to the meridian 12 hours before the sun. When the earth is at \\( H \\), the star comes to the meridian at 10 in the evening; at \\( I \\), it comes to the meridian 8, that is, 16 hours before the sun; at \\( K \\), 18 hours before him; at \\( L \\), 20 hours; at \\( M \\), 22; and at \\( A \\), equally with the sun again.\n\nThus it is plain, that an absolute turn of the earth on its axis (which is always completed when any particular meridian comes to be parallel to its situation at any time of the day before) never brings the same meridian round from the sun to the sun again; but that the earth requires as much more than one turn on its axis to finish a natural day, as it has gone forward in that time; which, at a mean\nmean state, is a 365th part of a circle. Hence, in 365 days the earth turns 366 times round its axis; and therefore, as a turn of the earth on its axis completes a sidereal day, there must be one sidereal day more in a year than the number of solar days, be the number what it will, on the earth, or any other planet. One turn being lost with respect to the number of solar days in a year, by the planets going round the sun; just as it would be lost to a traveller, who, in going round the earth, would lose one day by following the apparent diurnal motion of the sun; and consequently would reckon one day less at his return (let him take what time he would to go round the earth) than those who remained all the while at the place from which they set out. So, if there were two earths revolving equably on their axes, and if one remained at A until the other travelled round the sun from A to A again, that earth which kept its place at A would have its solar and sidereal days always of the same length; and so would have one solar day more than the other at its return. Hence, if the earth turned but once round its axis in a year, and if that turn was made the same way as the earth goes round the sun, there would be continual day on one side of the earth, and continual night on the other.\n\n**Chap. XI. Of the Equation of Time.**\n\nThe earth's motion on its axis being perfectly uniform, and equal at all times of the year, the sidereal days are always precisely of an equal length; and so would the solar or natural days be, if the earth's orbit were a perfect circle, and its axis perpendicular to its orbit. But the earth's diurnal motion on an inclined axis, and its annual motion in an elliptic orbit, cause the sun's apparent motion in the heavens to be unequal: For sometimes he revolves from the meridian to the meridian again in somewhat less than 24 hours, shewn by a well-regulated clock; and at other times in somewhat more: So that the time shewn by an equal going clock and a true sun-dial is never the same but on the 1st of April, the 16th of June, the 31st of August, and the 24th of December. The clock, if it goes equally and true all the year round, will be before the sun from the 21st of December till the 15th of April; from that time till the 16th of June the sun will be before the clock; from the 16th of June till the 31st of August, the clock will be again before the sun; and from thence to the 24th of December the sun will be faster than the clock.\n\nThe easiest and most expeditions way of drawing a meridian line is this: Make four or five concentric circles, about a quarter of an inch from one another, on a flat board, about a foot in breadth; and let the outmost circle be but little less than the board will contain. Fix a pin perpendicularly in the centre, and of such a length that its whole shadow may fall within the innermost circle, for at least four hours in the middle of the day. The pin ought to be about an eighth part of an inch thick, and to have a round blunt point. The board being set exactly level in a place where the sun shines, suppose from eight in the morning till four in the afternoon, about which hours the end of the shadow should fall without all the circles; watch the times in the forenoon, when the extremity of the shortening shadow just touches the several circles, and there make marks. Then, in the afternoon of the same day, watch the lengthening shadow, and where its end touches the several circles in going over them, make marks also. Lastly, with a pair of compasses, find exactly the middle point between the two marks on any circle, and draw a straight line from the centre to that point; which line will be covered at noon by the shadow of a small upright wire, which should be put in the place of the pin. The reason for drawing several circles is, that in case one part of the day should prove clear, and the other part somewhat cloudy, if you miss the time when the point of the shadow should touch one circle, you may perhaps catch it in touching another. The best time for drawing a meridian line, in this manner, is about the summer solstice; because the sun changes his declination slowest, and his altitude fastest in the longest days.\n\nIf the ciment of a window, on which the sun shines at noon, be quite upright, you may draw a line along the edge of its shadow on the floor, when the shadow of the pin is exactly on the meridian line of the board; and as the motion of the shadow of the ciment will be much more sensible on the floor, than that of the shadow of the pin on the board, you may know to a few seconds when it touches the meridian line on the floor; and so regulate your clock for the day of observation by that line and any good equation table.\n\nAs the equation of time, or difference between the time shewn by a well-regulated clock and a true sun-dial, depends upon two causes, namely, the obliquity of the ecliptic, and the unequal motion of the earth in it, we shall first explain the effects of these causes separately considered, and then the united effects resulting from their combination.\n\nThe earth's motion on its axis being perfectly equable, or always at the same rate, and the plane of the equator being perpendicular to its axis, it is evident, that in equal times equal portions of the equator pass over the meridian; and so would equal portions of the ecliptic, if it were parallel to or coincident with the equator. But, as the ecliptic is oblique to the equator, the equable motion of the earth carries unequal portions of the ecliptic over the meridian in equal times, the difference being proportionate to the obliquity; and, as some parts of the ecliptic are much more oblique than others, those differences are unequal among themselves. Therefore, if two suns should start either from the beginning of Aries or Libra, and continue to move through equal arcs in equal times, one in the equator, and the other in the ecliptic, the equatorial sun would always run to the meridian in 24 hours time, as measured by a well-regulated clock; but the sun in the ecliptic would return to the meridian sometimes sooner, and sometimes later than the equatorial sun; and only at the same moments with him on four days of the year; namely, the 20th of March, when the sun enters Aries; the 21st of June, when he enters Cancer; the 23rd of September, when he enters...\nenters Libra; and the 21st of December, when he enters Capricorn. But, as there is only one sun, and his apparent motion is always on the ecliptic, let us henceforth call him the real sun; and the other, which is supposed to move in the equator, the fictitious; to which last, the motion of a well-regulated clock always answers.\n\nIn Plate XLII, fig. 4, let \\( ZVz \\Omega \\) be the earth, \\( ZFrz \\) its axis, \\( abcd \\&c. \\) the equator, \\( ABCDE \\&c. \\) the northern half of the ecliptic from \\( V \\) or \\( \\Omega \\) on the side of the globe next the eye; and \\( MNOP \\&c. \\) the southern half on the opposite side from \\( \\Omega \\) to \\( V \\). Let the points at \\( ABCDEF \\&c. \\) quite round from \\( V \\) to \\( V \\) again bound equal portions of the ecliptic, gone through in equal times by the real sun; and those at \\( abcdef \\&c. \\) equal portions of the equator, described in equal times by the fictitious sun; and let \\( ZVz \\) be the meridian.\n\nAs the real sun moves obliquely in the ecliptic, and the fictitious sun directly in the equator, with respect to the meridian; a degree, or any number of degrees, between \\( V \\) and \\( F \\) on the ecliptic, must be nearer the meridian \\( ZVz \\) than a degree, or any corresponding number of degrees on the equator from \\( V \\) to \\( F \\); and the more so, as they are the more oblique: And therefore the true sun comes sooner to the meridian every day whilst he is in the quadrant \\( VF \\), than the fictitious sun does in the quadrant \\( VF \\); for which reason, the solar noon precedes noon by the clock, until the real sun comes to \\( F \\), and the fictitious to \\( F \\); which two points, being equidistant from the meridian, both suns will come to it precisely at noon by the clock.\n\nWhilst the real sun describes the second quadrant of the ecliptic \\( FGHK \\), from \\( F \\) to \\( \\Omega \\), he comes later to the meridian every day, than the fictitious sun moving through the second quadrant of the equator from \\( F \\) to \\( \\Omega \\); for the points at \\( GH \\) and \\( K \\), being farther from the meridian than their corresponding points at \\( ghik \\) and \\( k \\), they must be later of coming to it: And as both suns come at the same moment to the point \\( \\Omega \\), they come to the meridian at the moment of noon by the clock.\n\nIn departing from Libra, through the third quadrants, the real sun going through \\( MNOPQ \\) towards \\( r \\) at \\( R \\), and the fictitious sun through \\( mnopq \\) towards \\( r \\), the former comes to the meridian every day sooner than the latter, until the real sun comes to \\( r \\), and the fictitious to \\( r \\), and then they both come to the meridian at the same time.\n\nLastly, as the real sun moves equably through \\( STUVW \\), from \\( r \\) towards \\( V \\); and the fictitious sun thro' \\( stuvw \\), from \\( r \\) towards \\( V \\); the former comes later every day to the meridian than the latter, until they both arrive at the point \\( V \\), and then they make noon at the same time with the clock.\n\nThis part of the equation of time may perhaps be somewhat difficult to understand by a figure, because both halves of the ecliptic seem to be on the same side of the globe; but it may be made very easy to any person who has a real globe before him, by putting small patches on every tenth or fifteenth degree, both of the equator and ecliptic, beginning at Aries \\( V \\); and then, turning the ball slowly round westward, he will see all the patches from Aries to Cancer come to the brazen meridian sooner than the corresponding patches on the equator; all those from Cancer to Libra will come latter to the meridian than their corresponding patches on the equator; those from Libra to Capricorn sooner, and those from Capricorn to Aries latter: And the patches at the beginnings of Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn, being either on, or even with those on the equator, shew that the two suns either meet there, or are even with one another, and so come to the meridian at the same moment.\n\nLet us suppose that there are two little balls moving equably round a celestial globe by clock-work, one always keeping in the ecliptic, and gilt with gold, to represent the real sun; and the other keeping in the equator, and silvered, to represent the fictitious sun: And that whilst these balls move once round the globe, according to the order of signs, the clock turns the globe 366 times round its axis westward. The stars will make 366 diurnal revolutions from the brazen meridian to it again; and the two balls representing the real and fictitious sun always going farther eastward from any given star, will come later than it to the meridian every following day; and each ball will make 365 revolutions to the meridian; coming equally to it at the beginnings of Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn: But in every other point of the ecliptic, the gilt ball will come either sooner or latter to the meridian than the silver ball, like the patches above mentioned.\n\nThis would be a pretty enough way of shewing the reason why any given star, which, on a certain day of the year, comes to the meridian with the sun, passes over it so much sooner every following day, as on that day twelvemonth to come to the meridian with the sun again; and also to shew the reason why the real sun comes to the meridian sometimes sooner, sometimes later, than it is noon by the clock; and, on four days of the year, at the same time; whilst the fictitious sun always comes to the meridian when it is twelve at noon by the clock. This would be no difficult task for an artist to perform; for the gold ball might be carried round the ecliptic by a wire from its north pole, and the silver ball round the equator by a wire from its south pole, by means of a few wheels to each.\n\nIt is plain, that if the ecliptic were more obliquely fitted to the equator, as the dotted circle \\( VY \\Omega \\), the equal divisions from \\( V \\) to \\( Y \\) would come still sooner to the meridian \\( ZVY \\) than those marked \\( ABCD \\) and \\( E \\) do; for two divisions containing 30 degrees, from \\( V \\) to the second dot, a little short of the figure 1, come sooner to the meridian than one division containing only 15 degrees from \\( V \\) to \\( A \\) does, as the ecliptic now stands: and those of the second quadrant from \\( Y \\) to \\( \\Omega \\) would be so much later. The third quadrant would be as the first, and the fourth as the second. And it is likewise plain, that where the ecliptic is most oblique, namely, about Aries and Libra, the difference would be greatest; and least about Cancer and Capricorn, where the obliquity is least.\n\nHaving explained one cause of the difference of time shewn by a well-regulated clock and a true sun-dial; and considered the sun, not the earth, as moving in the ecliptic\nWe now proceed to explain the other cause of this difference, namely, the inequality of the sun's apparent motion, which is slowest in the summer, when the sun is farthest from the earth, and swiftest in winter when he is nearest to it. But the earth's motion on its axis is equable all the year round, and is performed from west to east; which is the way that the sun appears to change his place in the ecliptic.\n\nIf the sun's motion were equable in the ecliptic, the whole difference, between the equal time as shown by a clock, and the unequal time as shown by the sun, would arise from the obliquity of the ecliptic. But the sun's motion sometimes exceeds a degree in 24 hours, though generally it is less. And when his motion is slowest, any particular meridian will revolve sooner to him than when his motion is quickest; for it will overtake him in less time when he advances a less space than when he moves through a larger.\n\nNow, if there were two suns moving in the plane of the ecliptic, so as to go round it in a year; one the describing an equal arc every 24 hours, and the other describing sometimes a less arc 24 hours, and at other times a larger, gaining at one time of the year what it lost at the opposite; it is evident that either of these suns would come sooner or latter to the meridian than the other, as it happened to be behind or before the other; and when they were both in conjunction, they would come to the meridian at the same moment.\n\nAs the real sun moves unequally in the ecliptic, let us suppose a fictitious sun to move equably in a circle coincident with the plane of the ecliptic. In Plate XLIII, fig. 1, let ABCD be the ecliptic or orbit in which the real sun moves, and the dotted circle abcd the imaginary orbit of the fictitious sun; each going round in a year according to the order of letters, or from west to east. Let HIKL be the earth turning round its axis the same way every 24 hours; and suppose both suns to start from A and a, in a right line with the plane of the meridian EH, at the same moment; the real sun at A being then at his greatest distance from the earth, at which time his motion is slowest; and the fictitious sun at a, whose motion is always equable, because his distance from the earth is supposed to be always the same. In the time that the meridian revolves from H to H again, according to the order of the letters HIKL, the real sun has moved from A to F; and the fictitious with a quicker motion from a to f, through a larger arc. Therefore, the meridian EH will revolve sooner from H to h under the real sun at F, than from H to k under the fictitious sun at f; consequently it will then be noon, by the sun-dial sooner than by the clock.\n\nAs the real sun moves from A towards C, the swiftness of his motion increases all the way to C, where it is at the quickest. But notwithstanding this, the fictitious sun gains so much upon the real, soon after his departing from A, that the increasing velocity of the real sun does not bring him up with the equally moving fictitious sun till the former comes to C, and the latter to c, when each has gone half round its respective orbit; and then being in conjunction, the meridian EH revolving to EK comes to both suns at the same time, and therefore it is noon by them both at the same moment.\n\nBut the increasing velocity of the real sun, now being at the quickest, carries him before the fictitious one; and therefore, the same meridian will come to the fictitious sun sooner than to the real: For, whilst the fictitious sun moves from c to g, the real sun moves through a greater arc from C to G; consequently the point K has its noon by the clock when it comes to k, but not its noon by the sun till it come to l. And although the velocity of the real sun diminishes all the way from C to A, and the fictitious sun by an equable motion is still coming nearer to the real sun, yet they are not in conjunction till the one comes to A and the other to a; and then it is noon by them both at the same moment.\n\nThus it appears, that the solar noon is always later than noon by the clock, whilst the sun goes from C to A; sooner whilst he goes from A to C; and at these points the sun and clock being equal, it is noon by them both at the same moment.\n\nThe point A is called the sun's apogee, because when he is there he is at his greatest distance from the earth; the point C his perigee, because when in it he is at his least distance from the earth; and a right line, as AEC, drawn through the earth's centre, from one of these points to the other, is called the line of the apsides.\n\nThe distance that the sun has gone in any time from his apogee (not the distance he has to go to it, though ever so little) is called his mean anomaly, and is reckoned in signs and degrees, allowing 30 degrees to a sign. Thus, when the sun has gone, suppose 174 degrees from his apogee at A, he is said to be 5 signs 24 degrees from it, which is his mean anomaly: And when he is gone, suppose 355 degrees from his apogee, he is said to be 11 signs 25 degrees from it, although he be but 5 degrees short of A in coming round to it again.\n\nFrom what was said above, it appears, than when the sun's anomaly is less than 6 signs, that is, when he is anywhere between A and C, in the half ABC of his orbit, the solar noon precedes the clock noon; but when his anomaly is more than 6 signs, that is, when he is anywhere between C and A, in the half CDA of his orbit, the clock noon precedes the solar. When his anomaly is 0 signs 0 degrees, that is, when he is in his apogee at A; or 6 signs 0 degrees, which is when he is in his perigee at C; he comes to the meridian at the moment that the fictitious sun does, and then it is noon by them both at the same instant.\n\nThe obliquity of the ecliptic to the equator, which is the first mentioned cause of the equation of time, would make the sun and clocks agree on four days of the year; which are, when the sun enters Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn: But the other cause, now explained, would make the sun and clocks equal only twice a year; that is, when the sun is in his apogee and perigee. Consequently, when these two points fall in the beginnings of Cancer and Capricorn, or of Aries and Libra, they concur in making the sun and clocks equal in these points. But the apogee at present is in the 9th degree of Cancer, and\nand the perigee in the 9th degree of Capricorn, and therefore the sun and clocks cannot be equal about the beginning of these signs, nor at any time of the year, except when the swiftness or slowness of equation resulting from one cause just balances the slowness or swiftness arising from the other.\n\n**Chap. XII. Of the Precession of the Equinoxes.**\n\nIt is a known fact, that there is a greater quantity of matter accumulated all round the equatorial parts of the earth than anywhere else.\n\nThe sun and moon, by attracting this redundancy of matter, bring the equator sooner under them in every return towards it, than if there was no such accumulation. Therefore, if the sun sets out, as from any star, or other fixed point in the heavens, the moment when he is departing from the equinoctial or from either tropic, he will come to the same equinox or tropic again 20 min. $17\\frac{1}{2}$ sec. of time, or 50 seconds of a degree, before he completes his course, so as to arrive at the same fixed star or point from whence he set out. For, the equinoctial points recede 50 seconds of a degree westward every year, contrary to the sun's annual progressive motion.\n\nWhen the sun arrives at the same equinoctial or solstitial point, he finishes what we call the tropical year; which, by observation, is found to contain 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes 57 seconds. And, when he arrives at the same fixed star again, as seen from the earth, he completes the sidereal year, which contains 365 days 6 hours 9 minutes $14\\frac{1}{2}$ seconds. The sidereal year is therefore 20 minutes $17\\frac{1}{2}$ seconds longer than the solar or tropical year; and 9 minutes $14\\frac{1}{2}$ seconds longer than the Julian or civil year, which we state at 365 days 6 hours: So that the civil year is almost a mean betwixt the sidereal and tropical.\n\nAs the sun describes the whole ecliptic, or 360 degrees, in a tropical year, he moves 59 minutes 8 seconds of a degree very day at a mean rate; and consequently 50 seconds of a degree in 20 minutes $17\\frac{1}{2}$ seconds of time: Therefore, he will arrive at the same equinox or solstice when he is 50 seconds of a degree short of the same star or fixed point in the heavens from which he set out in the year before. So that, with respect to the fixed stars, the sun and equinoctial points fall back (as it were) 30 degrees in 2160 years; which will make the stars appear to have gone 30 degrees forward, with respect to the signs of the ecliptic in that time: For the same signs always keep in the same points of the ecliptic, without regard to the constellations.\n\nTo explain this by a figure, (Plate XLIII. fig. 1.) let the sun be in conjunction with a fixed star at S; suppose in the 30th degree of $\\alpha$ on the 21st of May 1756. Then, making 2160 revolutions through the ecliptic VWX, at the end of so many sidereal years, he will be found again at S: But at the end of so many Julian years, he will be found at M, short of S; and at the end of so many tropical years, he will be found short of M in the 30th degrees of Taurus at T, which has receded back from S to T in that time, by the precession of the equinoctial points $\\gamma$ Aries and $\\alpha$ Libra. The arc ST will be equal to the amount of the precession of the equinox in 2160 years, at the rate of 50 seconds of a degree, or 20 minutes $17\\frac{1}{2}$ seconds of time, annually: This, in so many years, makes 30 days $10\\frac{1}{2}$ hours; which is the difference between 2160 sidereal and tropical years: And the arc MT will be equal to the space moved through by the sun in 2160 times 11 minutes 3 seconds, or 16 days 13 hours 48 minutes, which is the difference between 2160 Julian and tropical years.\nA Table shewing the Precession of the Equinoctial Points in the Heavens, both in Motion and Time; and the Anticipation of the Equinoxes on Earth.\n\n| Julian years | Procession of the Equinoctial Points in the Heavens | Anticipation of the Equinoxes on the Earth |\n|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n|              | Motion.                                            | Time.                                    | D.

stars which, in the infancy of astronomy, were in Aries, are now got into Taurus; those of Taurus into Gemini, &c. Hence likewise it is, that the stars which rose or set at any particular season of the year, in the times of Hesiod, Eudoxius, Virgil, Pliny, &c., by no means answer at this time to their descriptions. The preceding table shews the quantity of this shifting both in the heavens and on the earth, for any number of years to 25,920, which compleats the grand celestial period; within which any number and its quantity is easily found, as in the following example, for 5763 years; which, at the autumnal equinox, A.D. 1756, is thought to be the age of the world. So that with regard to the fixed stars, the equinoctial points in the heavens have receded 2\u00b0 26' 2\" 30\" since the creation; which is as much as the sun moves in 81\u00b0 5' 0\" 52\". And since that time, or in 5763 years, the equinoxes with us have fallen back 44\u00b0 5' 21\" 9\"; hence, reckoning from the time of the Julian equinox, A.D. 1756, viz. Sept. 11th, it appears, that the autumnal equinox at the creation was on the 25th of October.\n\n| Julian years | Precelion of the Equinoctial Points in the Heavens | Anticipation of the Equinoxes on the Earth |\n|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n|              | Motion.                                          | Time.                                    |\n|              | D.

And that the same seasons might be kept to the same times of the year for the future, to leave out the bisectional day in February at the end of every century of years not divisible by 4; reckoning them only common years, as the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, viz. the years 1700, 1800, 1900, &c., because a day intercalated every fourth year was too much, and retaining the bisectional day at the end of those centuries of years which are divisible by 4, as the 16th, 20th, and 24th centuries, viz. the years 1600, 2000, 2400, &c. Otherwise, in length of time, the seasons would be quite reversed with regard to the months of the year; though it would have required near 23,783 years to have brought about such a total change. If the earth had made exactly 365\u00bc diurnal rotations on its axis, whilst it revolved from any equinoctial or solstitial point to the same again, the civil and solar years would always have kept pace together, and the style would never have needed any alteration.\n\nHaving already mentioned the cause of the precession of the equinoctial points in the heavens, which occasions a slow deviation of the earth's axis from its parallelism, and thereby a change of the declination of the stars from the equator, together with a slow apparent motion of the stars forward with respect to the signs of the ecliptic; we shall now describe the phenomena by a diagram.\n\nIn Plate XLIII, fig. 2, let NZSVL be the earth, SONA its axis produced to the starry heavens, and terminating in A, the present north pole of the heavens, which is vertical to N the north pole of the earth. Let EOQ be the equator, TZ the tropic of Cancer, and VTrs the tropic of Capricorn; VOZ the ecliptic, and BO its axis, both which are immovable among the stars. But as the equinoctial points recede in the ecliptic, the earth's axis SON is in motion upon the earth's centre O, in such a manner as to describe the double cone NOM and SOI, round the axis of the ecliptic BO, in the time that the equinoctial points move quite round the ecliptic, which is 25,920 years; and in that length of time, the north pole of the earth's axis produced, describes the circle ABCDA in the starry heavens, round the pole of the ecliptic, which keeps immovable in the centre of that circle. The earth's axis being 23\u00bd degrees inclined to the axis of the ecliptic, the circle ADCDA, described by the north pole of the earth's axis produced to A, is 47 degrees in diameter, or double the inclination of the earth's axis. In consequence of this, the point A, which at present is the north pole of the heavens, and near to a star of the second magnitude in the tail of the constellation called the Little Bear, must be deserted by the earth's axis, which moving backwards a degree every 72 years, will be directed towards the star or point B in\n6480 years hence; and in double of that time, or 12,960 years, it will be directed towards the star or point C; which will then be the north pole of the heavens, although it is at present 8\u00bd degrees south of the zenith of London L. The present position of the equator EQQ, will then be changed into eOq; the tropic of Cancer T\u03a3Z, into Vt\u03a3; and the tropic of Capricorn VTr, into trZ; as is evident by the figure. And the sun, in the same part of the heavens where he is now over the earthly tropic of Capricorn, and makes the shortest days and longest nights in the northern hemisphere, will then be over the earthly tropic of Cancer, and make the days longest and nights shortest. So that it will require 12,960 years yet more, or 25,920 from the present time, to bring the north pole N quite round, so as to be directed towards that point of the heavens which is vertical to it at present. And then, and not till then, the same stars which at present describe the equator, tropics, and polar circles, &c. by the earth's diurnal motion, will describe them over again.\n\n**Chap. XIII. The moon's surface mountainous: Her phases described: Her path and the paths of Jupiter's moons delineated: The proportions of the diameters of their orbits, and those of Saturn's moons, to each other, and to the diameter of the Sun.**\n\nBy looking at the moon with an ordinary telescope, we perceive that her surface is diversified with long tracts of prodigious high mountains and deep cavities. Some of her mountains, by comparing their height with her diameter (which is 2180 miles) are found to be three times higher than the highest hills on our earth. This ruggedness of the moon's surface is of great use to us, by reflecting the sun's light to all sides; for if the moon were smooth and polished like a looking-glass, or covered with water, she could never distribute the sun's light all round; only in some positions she would show us his image no bigger than a point, but with such a lustre as would be hurtful to our eyes.\n\nThe moon's surface being so uneven, many have wondered why her edge appears not jagged, as well as the curve bounding the light and dark places. But if we consider, that what we call the edge of the moon's disk is not a single line set round with mountains, in which case it would appear irregularly indented, but a large zone having many mountains lying behind one another from the observer's eye, we shall find that the mountains in some rows will be opposite to the vales in others, and so fill up the inequalities as to make her appear quite round; just as when one looks at an orange, although its roughness be very discernible on the side next the eye, especially if the sun or a candle shines obliquely on that side, yet the line terminating the visible part still appears smooth and even.\n\nAs the sun can only enlighten that half of the earth which is at any moment turned towards him, and being withdrawn from the opposite half, leaves it in darkness; so he likewise doth to the moon; only with this difference, that the earth being surrounded by an atmosphere, and the moon having none, we have twilight after the sun sets; but the lunar inhabitants have an immediate transition from the brightest sun-shine to the blackest darkness. For, (Plate XLIII. fig. 3.) let throw be the earth, and ABCDEFGH the moon in eight different parts of her orbit. As the earth turns round its axis from west to east, when any place comes to t the twilight begins there, and when it revolves from thence to r the sun S rises; when the place comes to s the sun sets, and when it comes to w the twilight ends. But as the moon turns round her axis, which is only once a-month, the moment that any point of her surface comes to r (see the moon at G) the sun rises there without any previous warning by twilight; and when the same point comes to s the sun sets, and that point goes into darkness as black as at midnight.\n\nThe moon being an opaque spherical body, (for her hills take off no more from her roundness than the inequalities on the surface of an orange takes off from its roundness), we can only see that part of the enlightened half of her which is towards the earth. And therefore, when the moon is at A, in conjunction with the sun S, her dark half is towards the earth, and she disappears, as at a, there being no light on that half to render it visible. When she comes to her first octant at B, or has gone an eighth part of her orbit from her conjunction, a quarter of her enlightened side is towards the earth, and she appears horned, as at b. When she has gone a quarter of her orbit from between the earth and sun to C, she shows us one half of her enlightened side, as at c, and we say, she is a quarter old. At D in her second octant, and by shewing us more of her enlightened side she appears gibbous, as at d. At E her whole enlightened side is towards the earth, and therefore she appears round, as at e, when we say, it is full moon. In her third octant at F, part of her dark side being towards the earth, she again appears gibbous, and is on the decrease, as at f. At G we see just one half of her enlightened side, and she appears half decreased, or in her third quarter, as at g. At H we only see a quarter of her enlightened side, being in her fourth octant, where she appears horned, as at h. And at A, having completed her course from the sun to the sun again, she disappears, and we say, it is new moon. Thus in going from A to E, the moon seems continually to increase; and in going from E to A, to decrease in the same proportion; having like phases at equal distances from A or E, but as seen from the sun S, she is always full.\n\nThe moon appears not perfectly round when she is full in the highest or lowest part of her orbit, because we have not a full view of her enlightened side at that time. When full in the highest part of her orbit, a small deficiency appears on her lower edge; and the contrary when full in the lowest part of her orbit.\n\nIt is plain by the figure, that when the moon changes to the earth, the earth appears full to the moon; and vice versa. For when the moon is at A, new to the earth, the whole enlightened side of the earth is towards the moon; and when the moon is at E, full to the earth,\nits dark side is towards her. Hence a new moon answers to a full earth, and a full moon to a new earth. The quarters are also reversed to each other.\n\nBetween the third quarter and change, the moon is frequently visible in the forenoon, even when the sun shines; and then she affords us an opportunity of seeing a very agreeable appearance, where-ever we find a globular stone above the level of the eye, as suppose on the top of a gate. For, if the sun shines on the stone, and we place ourselves so as the upper part of the sun may just seem to touch the point of the moon's lowermost horn, we shall then see the enlightened part of the stone exactly of the same shape with the moon, horned as she is, and inclining the same way to the horizon. The reason is plain, for the sun enlightens the stone the same way as he does the moon; and both being globes, when we put ourselves into the above situation, the moon and stone have the same position to our eyes, and therefore we must see as much of the illuminated part of the one as of the other.\n\nThe position of the moon's cusps, or a right line touching the points of her horns, is very differently inclined to the horizon at different hours of the same days of her age. Sometimes she stands, as it were, upright on her lower horn, and then such a line is perpendicular to the horizon: when this happens, she is in what the astronomers call the nonagestral degree, which is the highest point of the ecliptic above the horizon at that time, and is 90 degrees from both sides of the horizon, where it is then cut by the ecliptic. But this never happens when the moon is on the meridian, except when she is at the very beginning of Cancer or Capricorn.\n\nThe inclination of that part of the ecliptic to the horizon in which the moon is at any time when horned, may be known by the position of her horns; for a right line touching their points is perpendicular to the ecliptic. And as the angle that the moon's orbit makes with the ecliptic can never raise her above, nor depress her below the ecliptic, more than two minutes of a degree, as seen from the sun, it can have no sensible effect upon the position of her horns. Therefore, if a quadrant be held up, so as one of its edges may seem to touch the moon's horns, the graduated side being kept towards the eye, and as far from the eye as it can be conveniently held, the arc between the plumb-line and that edge of the quadrant which seems to touch the moon's horns, will show the inclination of that part of the ecliptic to the horizon. And the arc between the other edge of the quadrant and plumb-line will show the inclination of the moon's horns to the horizon.\n\nThe moon generally appears as large as the sun; for the angle \\( \\theta kA \\) (Plate XLIII. fig. 3.) under which the moon is seen from the earth, is the same with the angle \\( LkM \\), under which the sun is seen from it. And therefore the moon may hide the sun's whole disk from us, as sometimes does in solar eclipses. The reason why she does not eclipse the sun at every change shall be explained afterwards. If the moon were farther from the earth, as at \\( a \\), she could never hide the whole of the sun from us; for then she would appear under the angle \\( NkO \\), eclipsing only that part of the sun which lies between \\( N \\) and \\( O \\): were she still further from the earth, as at \\( X \\), she would appear under the small angle \\( TkW \\), like a spot on the sun, hiding only the part \\( TW \\) from our sight.\n\nThe moon turns round her axis in the time that she goes round her orbit; which is evident from hence, that a spectator at rest, without the periphery of the moon's orbit, would see all her sides turned regularly towards him in that time. She turns round her axis from any star to the same star again in 27 days 8 hours; from the sun to the sun again in 29\u00bd days: the former is the length of the sidereal day, and the latter the length of her solar day. A body moving round the sun would have a solar day in every revolution, without turning on its axis, the same as if it had kept all the while at rest, and the sun moved round it; but without turning round its axis it could never have one sidereal day, because it would always keep the same side towards any given star.\n\nIf the earth had no annual motion, the moon would go round it so as to compleat a lunation, a sidereal, and a solar day, all in the same time. But, because the earth goes forward in its orbit, while the moon goes round the earth in her orbit, the moon must go as much more than round her orbit from change to change in compleating a solar day, as the earth has gone forward in its orbit during that time, i.e., almost a twelfth part of a circle.\n\nThe moon's periodical and synodical revolution may be familiarly represented by the motions of the hour and minute-hands of a watch round its dial-plate, which is divided into 12 equal parts or hours, as the ecliptic is divided into 12 signs, and the year into 12 months. Let us suppose these 12 hours to be 12 signs, the hour-hand the sun, and the minute-hand the moon; then will the former go round once in a year, and the latter once in a month; but the moon, or minute-hand, must go more than round from any point of the circle where it was last conjoined with the sun, or hour-hand, to overtake it again: For the hour-hand being in motion, can never be overtaken by the minute-hand at that point from which they started at their last conjunction.\n\nIf the earth had no annual motion, the moon's motion round the earth, and her track in absolute space, would be always the same. But as the earth and moon move round the sun, the moon's real path in the heavens is very different from her visible path round the earth; the latter being in a progressive circle, and the former in a curve of different degrees of concavity, which would always be the same in the same parts of the heavens, if the moon performed a complete number of lunations in a year without anything over.\n\nLet a nail in the end of the axle of a chariot-wheel represent the earth, and a pin in the nave the moon; if the body of the chariot be propped up so as to keep that wheel from touching the ground, and the wheel be then turned round by hand, the pin will describe a circle both round the nail, and in the space it moves through. But if the props be taken away, the horses put to, and the chariot driven over a piece of ground which is circularly convex, the nail in the axle will describe a circular curve, and the pin in the nave will still describe a circle round the progressive nail in the axle, but not in the space through which it moves. In this case, the curve described...\ndescribed by the nail will resemble in miniature as much of the earth's annual path round the sun, as it describes whilst the moon goes as often round the earth as the pin does round the nail; and the curve described by the nail will have some resemblance of the moon's path during so many lunations.\n\nLet us now suppose that the radius of the circular curve described by the nail in the axle is to the radius of the circle which the pin in the nave describes round the axle, as $337\\frac{1}{2}$ to 1; which is the proportion of the radius or semidiameter of the earth's orbit to that of the moon's, or of the circular curve $A \\ 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \\ 4 \\ 5 \\ 6 \\ 7 \\ B$, &c. to the little circle $a$; and then, whilst the progressive nail describes the said curve from $A$ to $E$, the pin will go once round the nail with regard to the centre of its path, and in so doing, will describe the curve $abcde$. The former will be a true representation of the earth's path for one lunation, and the latter of the moon's for that time. Here we may set aside the inequalities of the moon's motion, and also the earth's moving round its common centre of gravity and the moon's: All which, if they were truly copied in this experiment, would not sensibly alter the figure of the paths described by the nail and pin, even though they should rub against a plain upright surface all the way, and leave their tracks visible upon it. And if the chariot was driven forward on such a convex piece of ground, so as to turn the wheel several times round, the track of the pin in the nave would still be concave toward the centre of the circular curve described by the pin in the axle; as the moon's path is always concave to the sun in the centre of the earth's annual orbit.\n\nIn this diagram, the thickest curve line $ABCD$, with the numeral figures set to it, represents as much of the earth's annual orbit as it describes in 32 days from west to east; the little circles at $abcde$ show the moon's orbit in due proportion to the earth's; and the smallest curve $abcdef$ represents the line of the moon's path in the heavens for 32 days, accounted from any particular new moon at $a$. The machine, Plate XLIX, fig. 2, is for delineating the moon's path, and will be described, with the rest of the astronomical machinery, in the last chapter. The sun is supposed to be in the centre of the curve $A \\ 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \\ 4 \\ 5 \\ 6 \\ 7 \\ B$, &c., and the small dotted circles upon it represent the moon's orbit, of which the radius is in the same proportion to the earth's path in this scheme, that the radius of the moon's orbit in the heavens bears to the radius of the earth's annual path round the sun; that is, as $240,000$ to $81,000,000$, or as $1$ to $337\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nWhen the earth is at $A$, the new moon is at $a$; and in the seven days that the earth describes the curve $1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \\ 4 \\ 5 \\ 6 \\ 7$, the moon, in accompanying the earth describes the curve $ab$; and is in her first quarter at $b$ when the earth is at $B$. As the earth describes the curve $B \\ 8 \\ 9 \\ 10 \\ 11 \\ 12 \\ 13 \\ 14$, the moon describes the curve $bc$; and is at $c$, opposite to the sun, when the earth is at $C$. Whilst the earth describes the curve $C \\ 15 \\ 16 \\ 17 \\ 18 \\ 19 \\ 20 \\ 21 \\ 22$, the moon describes the curve $cd$; and is in her third quarter at $d$ when the earth is at $D$. Once more, whilst the earth describes the curve $D \\ 23 \\ 24 \\ 25 \\ 26 \\ 27 \\ 28 \\ 29$, the moon describes the curve $de$, and is again in conjunction at $e$ with the sun when the earth is at $E$, between the 29th and 30th day of the moon's age, accounted by the numeral figures from the new moon at $A$. In describing the curve $abcde$, the moon goes round the progressive earth as really as if she had kept in the dotted circle $A$, and the earth continued immovable in the centre of that circle.\n\nAnd thus we see, that although the moon goes round the earth in a circle, with respect to the earth's centre, her real path in the heavens is not very different in appearance from the earth's path. To shew that the moon's path is concave to the sun, even at the time of change, it is carried on a little farther into a second lunation, as to $f$.\n\nThe moon's absolute motion from her change to her first quarter, or from $a$ to $b$, is so much slower than the earth's, that she falls $240$ thousand miles (equal to the semidiameter of her orbit) behind the earth at her first quarter in $b$, when the earth is in $B$; that is, she falls back a space equal to her distance from the earth. From that time her motion is gradually accelerated to her opposition or full at $e$; and then she is come up as far as the earth, having regained what she lost in her first quarter from $a$ to $b$. From the full to the last quarter at $d$, her motion continues accelerated, so as to be just as far before the earth at $D$, as she was behind it at her first quarter in $b$. But, from $d$ to $e$ her motion is retarded to $o$, that she loses as much with respect to the earth as is equal to her distance from it, or to the semidiameter of her orbit; and by that means she comes to $e$, and is then in conjunction with the sun, as seen from the earth at $E$. Hence we find, that the moon's absolute motion is slower than the earth's from her third quarter to her first; and swifter than the earth's from her first quarter to her third: Her path being less curved than the earth's in the former case, and more in the latter. Yet it is still bent the same way towards the sun; for if we imagine the concavity of the earth's orbit to be measured by the length of a perpendicular line $Cg$, let down from the earth's place upon the straight line $bd$ at the full of the moon, and connecting the places of the earth at the end of the moon's first and third quarters, that length will be about $640$ thousand miles; and the moon, when new, only approaching nearer to the sun by $240$ thousand miles than the earth is; the length of the perpendicular let down from her place at that time upon the same straight line, and which shews the concavity of that part of her path, will be about $400$ thousand miles.\n\nThe moon's path being concave to the sun throughout, demonstrates that her gravity towards the sun, at her conjunction, exceeds her gravity towards the earth. And if we consider that the quantity of matter in the sun is almost $230$ thousand times as great as the quantity of matter in the earth, and that the attraction of each body diminishes as the square of the distance from it increases, we shall soon find, that the point of equal attraction between the earth and the sun is about $70$ thousand miles nearer the earth than the moon is at her change. It may now appear surprising, that the moon does not abandon the earth when she is between it and the sun, because she is considerably more attracted by the sun than by the earth.\nearth at that time. But this difficulty vanishes when we consider, that a common impulse on any system of bodies affects not their relative motions; but that they will continue to attract, impel, or circulate round one another, in the same manner as if there was no such impulse. The moon is so near the earth, and both of them so far from the sun, that the attractive power of the sun may be considered as equal on both; and therefore, the moon will continue to circulate round the earth in the same manner as if the sun did not attract them at all; like bodies in the cabin of a ship, which move round, or impel one another, in the same manner when the ship is under sail, as when it is at rest, because they are all equally affected by the common motion of the ship. If by any other cause, such as the near approach of a comet, the moon's distance from the earth should happen to be so much increased, that the difference of their gravitating forces towards the sun should exceed that of the moon towards the earth; in that case, the moon, when in conjunction, would abandon the earth, and be either drawn into the sun, or comet, or circulate round about it.\n\nThe curves which Jupiter's satellites describe, are all of different sorts from the path described by our moon, although these satellites go round Jupiter, as the moon goes round the earth. In Plate XLIII. fig. 3, let ABCDE, &c. be as much of Jupiter's orbit as he describes in 18 days from A to T; and the curves abcd will be the paths of his four moons going round him in his progressive motion.\n\nNow let us suppose all these moons to set out from a conjunction with the sun, as seen from Jupiter at A; then his first or nearest moon will be at a, his second at b, his third at c, and his fourth at d. At the end of 24 terrestrial hours after this conjunction, Jupiter has moved to B, his first moon or satellite has described the curve a1, his second the curve b1, his third c1, and his fourth d1. The next day, when Jupiter is at C, his first satellite has described the curve a2, from its conjunction, his second the curve b2, his third the curve c2, and his fourth the curve d2, and so on. The numeral figures under the capital letters show Jupiter's place in his path every day for 18 days, accounted from A to T; and the like figures set to the paths of his satellites, show where they are at the like times. The first satellite, almost under C, is stationary at + as seen from the sun; and retrograde from + to 2; at 2 it appears stationary again, and thence it moves forward until it has past 3, and is twice stationary, and once retrograde, between 3 and 4. The path of this satellite intersects itself every 42\u00bd hours, making such loops as in the diagram at 2 3 5 7 9 10 12 14 16 18, a little after every conjunction. The second satellite b, moving slower, barely crosses its path every 3 days 13 hours; as at 4 7 11 14 18, making only five loops and as many conjunctions in the time that the first makes ten. The third satellite c moving still slower, and having described the curve 1 2 3 4 5 6 7, comes to an angle at 7 in conjunction with the sun at the end of 7 days 4 hours; and so goes on to describe such another curve 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14, and is at 14 in its next conjunction. The fourth satellite d is always progressive, making neither loops nor angles in the heavens; but comes to its next conjunction at e between the numeral figures 16 and 17, or in 16 days 18 hours. In order to have a tolerably good figure of the paths of these satellites, take the following method.\n\nIt appears by the scheme, that the three first satellites come almost into the same line or position every seventh day; the first being only a little behind with the second, and the second behind with the third. But the period of the fourth satellite is so incommensurate to the periods of the other three, that it cannot be guessed at by the diagram when it would fall again into a line of conjunction with them, between Jupiter and the sun. And no wonder; for supposing them all to have been once in conjunction, it will require 3,087,043,493,260 years to bring them in conjunction again.\n\nIn Plate XLIV. fig. 1, we have the proportions of the orbits of Saturn's five satellites, and of Jupiter's four, to one another, to our moon's orbit, and to the disk of the sun. S is the sun; M m the moon's orbit, (the earth supposed to be at E); J Jupiter; 1 2 3 4 the orbits of his four moons or satellites; Sat Saturn; and 1 2 3 4 5 the orbits of his five moons. Hence it appears, that the sun would much more than fill the whole orbit of the moon; for the sun's diameter is 703,000 miles, and the diameter of the moon's orbit only 480,000. In proportion to all these orbits of the satellites, the radius of Saturn's annual orbit would be 21\u00bd yards, of Jupiter's orbit 11\u00bd, and of the earth's 2\u00bd, taking them in round numbers.\n\nCHAP. XIV. The Phenomena of the Harvest-moon explained by a common Globe: The years in which the Harvest-moons are least and most beneficial from 1751, to 1861. The long Duration of Moon-light at the Poles in Winter.\n\nIt is generally believed that the moon rises about 48 minutes later every day than on the preceding; but this is true only with regard to places on the equator. In places of considerable latitude there is a remarkable difference, especially in the harvest time; with which farmers were better acquainted than astronomers till of late; and gratefully ascribed the early rising of the full moon at that time of the year to the goodness of God, in ordering it so on purpose to give them an immediate supply of moon-light after sun-set for their greater convenience in reaping the fruits of the earth. And indeed,\n\nIn this instance of the harvest-moon, as in many others discoverable by astronomy, the wisdom and beneficence of the Deity is conspicuous, who really ordered the course of the moon so, as to bestow more or less light on all parts of the earth as their several circumstances and seasons render it more or less serviceable. About the equator, where there is no variety of seasons, and the weather changes seldom, and at stated times, moonlight is not necessary for gathering in the produce of the ground;\nground; and there the moon rises about 48 minutes later every day or night than on the former. At considerable distances from the equator, where the weather and seasons are more uncertain, the autumnal full moons rise very soon after sun-set for several evenings together. At the polar circles, where the mild season is of very short duration, the autumnal full moon rises at sun-set from the first to the third quarter. And at the poles, where the sun is for half a year absent, the winter full moons shine constantly without setting from the first to the third quarter.\n\nIt is soon said that all these phenomena are owing to the different angles made by the horizon and different parts of the moon's orbit; and that the moon can be full but once or twice in a year in those parts of her orbit which rise with the least angles. But to explain this subject intelligibly, we must dwell much longer upon it.\n\nThe plane of the equinoctial is perpendicular to the earth's axis; and therefore, as the earth turns round its axis, all parts of the equinoctial make equal angles with the horizon both at rising and setting; so that equal portions of it always rise or set in equal times. Consequently, if the moon's motion were equable, and in the equinoctial, at the rate of 12 degrees from the sun every day, as it is in her orbit, she would rise and set 48 minutes later every day than on the preceding; for 12 degrees of the equinoctial rise or set in 48 minutes of time, in all latitudes.\n\nBut the moon's motion is so nearly in the ecliptic, that we may consider her at present as moving in it. Now the different parts of the ecliptic, on account of its obliquity to the earth's axis, make very different angles with the horizon as they rise or set. Those parts or signs which rise with the smallest angles set with the greatest, and vice versa. In equal times, whenever this angle is least, a greater portion of the ecliptic rises than when the angle is larger; as may be seen by elevating the pole of a globe to any considerable latitude, and then turning it round its axis in the horizon. Consequently, when the moon is in those signs which rise or set with the smallest angles, she rises or sets with the least difference of time; and with the greatest difference in those signs which rise or set with the greatest angles.\n\nBut, because all who read this treatise may not be provided with globes, though in this case it is requisite to know how to use them, we shall substitute the figure of a globe; (Plate XLIV. fig. 2.) in which FUP is the axis, STR the tropic of Cancer, LTR the tropic of Capricorn, EUR the ecliptic touching both the tropics, which are 47 degrees from each other, and AB the horizon. The equator, being in the middle between the tropics, is cut by the ecliptic in two opposite points, which are the beginnings of V Aries and Libra. K is the hour-circle with its index, F the north pole of the globe elevated to a considerable latitude, suppose 40 degrees above the horizon, and P the south pole depressed as much below it. Because of the oblique position of the sphere in this latitude, the ecliptic has the high elevation N of 73 degrees with it when Cancer is on the meridian, at which time Libra rises in the east. But let the globe be turned half round its axis till rs Capricorn comes to the meridian and V Aries rises in the east, and then the ecliptic will have the low elevation NL above the horizon, making only an angle NUL of 26 degrees with it; which is 47 degrees less than the former angle, equal to the distance between the tropics.\n\nIn northern latitudes, the smallest angle made by the ecliptic and horizon is when Aries rises, at which time Libra sets; the greatest when Libra rises, at which time Aries sets. From the rising of Aries to the rising of Libra, (which is twelve sidereal hours), the angle increases; and from the rising of Libra to the rising of Aries, it decreases in the same proportion. By this article and the preceding, it appears that the ecliptic rises fastest about Aries, and slowest about Libra.\n\nOn the parallel of London, as much of the ecliptic rises about Pisces and Aries in two hours as the moon goes through in five days; and therefore whilst the moon is in these signs, the differs but two hours in rising for five days together; that is, about 20 minutes later every day or night than on the preceding, at a mean rate. But in 14 days afterwards, the moon comes to Virgo and Libra, which are the opposite signs to Pisces and Aries; and then the differs almost four times as much in rising; namely, one hour and about fifteen minutes later every day or night than the former, whilst she is in these signs.\n\nAll these things will be made plain by putting small patches on the ecliptic of a globe, as far from one another as the moon moves from any point of the celestial ecliptic in 24 hours, which at a mean rate is 13 degrees; and then in turning the globe round, observe the rising and setting of the patches in the horizon, as the index points out the different times in the hour-circle. A few of these patches are represented by dots at o r 2 3, &c. on the ecliptic, which has the position LUI when Aries rises in the east; and by the dots o 1 2 3, &c., when Libra rises in the east; at which time the ecliptic has the position EUR; making an angle of 62 degrees with the horizon in the latter case, and an angle of no more than 15 degrees with it in the former; supposing the globe rectified to the latitude of London.\n\nHaving rectified the globe, turn it until the patch at o, about the beginning of X Pisces in the half LUI of the ecliptic, comes to the eastern side of the horizon; and then keeping the ball steady, set the hour-index to XII, because that hour may perhaps be more easily remembered than any other. Then turn the globe round westward, and in that time, suppose the patch o to have moved thence to 1, 13 degrees, whilst the earth turns once round its axis, and you will see that 1 rises only about 20 minutes later than o did on the day before. Turn the globe round again, and in that time suppose the same patch to have moved from 1 to 2; and it will rise only 20 minutes later by the hour-index than it did at 1 on the day or turn before. At the end of the next turn, suppose the patch to have gone from 2 to 3 at U, and it will rise 20 minutes later than it did at 2. And so on for six turns, in which time there will scarce be two hours difference: nor would there have been so much if\nthe 6 degrees of the sun's motion in that time had been allowed for. At the first turn the patch rises south of the east, at the middle turn due east, and at the last turn north of the east. But these patches will be 9 hours of setting on the western side of the horizon, which shows that the moon will be so much later of setting in that week in which she moves through these two signs. The cause of this difference is evident; for Pisces and Aries make only an angle of 15 degrees with the horizon when they rise; but they make an angle of 62 degrees with it when they set. As the signs Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, and Libra, rise successively, the angle increases gradually which they make with the horizon; and decreases in the same proportion as they set. And for that reason, the moon differs gradually more in the time of her rising every day whilst she is in these signs; and less in her setting: after which, through the other six signs, viz. Scorpio, Sagittary, Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, and Aries, the rising difference becomes less every day, until it be at the least of all, namely, in Pisces and Aries.\n\nThe moon goes round the ecliptic in 27 days 8 hours; but not from change to change in less than 29 days 12 hours: so that she is in Pisces and Aries at least once in every lunation, and in some lunations twice.\n\nIf the earth had no annual motion, the sun would never appear to shift his place in the ecliptic. And then every new moon would fall in the same sign and degree of the ecliptic, and every full moon in the opposite; for the moon would go precisely round the ecliptic from change to change. So that if the moon was once full in Pisces or Aries, she would always be full when she came round to the same sign and degree again. And as the full moon rises at sun-set (because when any point of the ecliptic sets, the opposite point rises) she would constantly rise within two hours of sun-set, on the parallel of London, during the week in which she were full. But in the time that the moon goes round the ecliptic from any conjunction or opposition, the earth goes almost a sign forward; and therefore the sun will seem to go as far forward in that time, namely, 27\u00bd degrees; so that the moon must go 27\u00bd degrees more than round, and as much farther as the sun advances in that interval, which is 2\u00bd degrees, before she can be in conjunction with, or opposite to, the sun again. Hence it is evident, that there can be but one conjunction or opposition of the sun and moon in a year in any particular part of the ecliptic. This may be familiarly exemplified by the hour and minute-hands of a watch, which are never in conjunction or opposition in that part of the dial-plate where they were so last before. And indeed, if we compare the twelve hours on the dial-plate to the twelve signs of the ecliptic, the hour-hand to the sun, and the minute-hand to the moon, we shall have a tolerably near resemblance in miniature to the motions of our great celestial luminaries. The only difference is, that whilst the sun goes once round the ecliptic, the moon makes 12\u00bd conjunctions with him: but whilst the hour-hand goes round the dial-plate, the minute-hand makes only 11 conjunctions with it; because the minute-hand moves slower in respect of the hour-hand than the moon does with regard to the sun.\n\nAs the moon can never be full but when she is opposite to the sun, and the sun is never in Virgo and Libra but in our autumnal months, it is plain that the moon is never full in the opposite signs, Pisces and Aries, but in these two months. And therefore we can have only two full moons in the year, which rise so near the time of sun-set, for a week together, as above mentioned. The former of these is called the harvest-moon, and the latter the hunter's moon.\n\nHere it will probably be asked, Why we never observe this remarkable rising of the moon but in harvest, since she is, in Pisces and Aries twelve times in the year besides; and must then rise with as little difference of time as in harvest? The answer is plain: for in winter these signs rise at noon; and being then only a quarter of a circle distant from the sun, the moon in them is in her first quarter: But when the sun is above the horizon, the moon's rising is neither regarded nor perceived. In spring these signs rise with the sun, because he is then in them; and as the moon changeth in them at that time of the year, she is quite invisible. In summer they rise about midnight, and the sun being then three signs, or a quarter of a circle before them, the moon is in them about her third quarter; when rising so late, and giving but very little light, her rising passes unobserved. And in autumn, these signs, being opposite to the sun, rise when he sets, with the moon in opposition, or at the full, which makes her rising very conspicuous.\n\nAt the equator, the north and south poles lie in the horizon; and therefore the ecliptic makes the same angle southward with the horizon when Aries rises, as it does northward when Libra rises. Consequently, as the moon at all the fore-mentioned patches rises and sets nearly at equal angles with the horizon all the year round, and about 48 minutes later every day or night than on the preceding, there can be no particular harvest-moon at the equator.\n\nThe farther that any place is from the equator, if it be not beyond the polar circle, the angle gradually diminishes which the ecliptic and horizon make when Pisces and Aries rise: And therefore, when the moon is in these signs she rises with a nearly proportional difference later every day than on the former; and is for that reason the more remarkable about the full, until we come to the polar circles, or 66 degrees from the equator; in which latitude the ecliptic and horizon become coincident every day for a moment, at the same sidereal hour, (or 3 minutes 56 seconds sooner every day than the former), and the very next moment one half of the ecliptic, containing Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, and Gemini rises, and the opposite half sets. Therefore, whilst the moon is going from the beginning of Capricorn to the beginning of Cancer, which is almost 14 days, she rises at the same sidereal hour; and in autumn, just at sun-set, because all that half of the ecliptic, in which the sun is at that time, sets at the same sidereal hour, and the opposite half rises; that is, 3 minutes 56 seconds, of mean solar time, sooner every day than on the day before. So, whilst the moon is going from Capricorn to Cancer, she rises earlier every day than on the preceding, contrary to what she does at all places.\nplaces between the polar circles. But, during the above fourteen days, the moon is 24 sidereal hours later in setting; for the fix signs, which rise all at once on the eastern side of the horizon, are 24 hours in setting on the western side of it; as any one may see by making chalk-marks at the beginning of Capricorn and of Cancer, and then, having elevated the pole 66\u00bd degrees, turn the globe slowly round its axis, and observe the rising and setting of the ecliptic. As the beginning of Aries is equally distant from the beginning of Cancer and of Capricorn, it is in the middle of that half of the ecliptic which rises all at once. And when the sun is at the beginning of Libra, he is in the middle of the other half. Therefore, when the sun is in Libra, and the moon in Capricorn, the moon is a quarter of a circle before the sun; opposite to him, and consequently full in Aries, and a quarter of a circle behind him, when in Cancer. But when Libra rises, Aries sets, and all that half of the ecliptic of which Aries is the middle; and therefore, at that time of the year, the moon rises at sun-set from her first to her third quarter.\n\nIn northern latitudes, the autumnal full moons are in Pisces and Aries, and the vernal full moons in Virgo and Libra: In southern latitudes just the reverse, because the seasons are contrary. But Virgo and Libra rise at small angles with the horizon in southern latitudes, as Pisces and Aries do in the northern; and therefore the harvest-moons are just as regular on one side of the equator as on the other.\n\nAs these signs, which rise with the least angles, set with the greatest, the vernal full moons differ as much in their times of rising every night, as the autumnal full moons differ in their times of setting; and set with as little difference as the autumnal full moons rise; the one being in all cases the reverse of the other.\n\nHitherto, for the sake of plainness, we have supposed the moon to move in the ecliptic, from which the sun never deviates. But the orbit in which the moon really moves is different from the ecliptic; one half being elevated 5\u00bd degrees above it, and the other half as much depressed below it. The moon's orbit therefore intersects the ecliptic in two points diametrically opposite to each other; and these intersections are called the moon's nodes. So the moon can never be in the ecliptic but when she is in either of her nodes, which is at least twice in every course from change to change, and sometimes thrice. For, as the moon goes almost a whole sign more than round her orbit from change to change, if she passes by either node about the time of change, she will pass by the other in about fourteen days after, and come round to the former node two days again before the next change. That node, from which the moon begins to ascend northward, or above the ecliptic, in northern latitudes, is called the ascending node; and the other, the descending node; because the moon, when she passes by it, descends below the ecliptic southward.\n\nThe moon's oblique motion, with regard to the ecliptic, causes some difference in the times of her rising and setting from what is already mentioned. For whilst she is northward of the ecliptic, she rises sooner and sets later than if she moved in the ecliptic; and when she is southward of the ecliptic, she rises later, and sets sooner. This difference is variable, even in the same signs, because the nodes shift backward about 19\u00bd degrees in the ecliptic every year; and so go round it contrary to the order of signs in 18 years 235 days.\n\nWhen the ascending node is in Aries, the southern half of the moon's orbit makes an angle of 5\u00bd degrees less with the horizon than the ecliptic does, when Aries rises in northern latitudes: For which reason the moon rises with less difference of time whilst she is in Pisces and Aries, than there would be if she kept in the ecliptic. But in 9 years and 112 days afterward, the descending node comes to Aries; and then the moon's orbit makes an angle 5\u00bd degrees greater with the horizon when Aries rises, that the ecliptic does at that time; which causes the moon to rise with greater difference of time in Pisces and Aries than if she moved in the ecliptic.\n\nTo be a little more particular; when the ascending node is in Aries, the angle is only 9\u00bd degrees on the parallel of London when Aries rises. But when the descending node comes to Aries, the angle is 20\u00bd degrees; this occasions as great a difference of the moon's rising in the same signs every 9 years, as there would be on two parallels to 10\u00bd degrees from one another, if the moon's course were in the ecliptic.\n\nAs there is a complete revolution of the nodes in 18\u00bd years, there must be a regular period of all the varieties which can happen in the rising and setting of the moon during that time. But this shifting of the nodes never affects the moon's rising so much, even in her quickest descending latitude, as not to allow us still the benefit of her rising nearer the time of sun-set for a few days together about the full in harvest, than when she is full at any other time of the year. The following table shows in what years the harvest-moons are least beneficial as to the times of their rising, and in what years most, from 1751 to 1861. The column of years under the letter L are those in which the harvest-moons are least of all beneficial, because they fall about the descending node; and those under M are the most of all beneficial, because they fall about the ascending node. In all the columns from N to S, the harvest-moons descend gradually in the lunar orbit, and rise to less heights above the horizon. From S to N they ascend in the same proportion, and rise to greater heights above the horizon. In both the columns under S, the harvest-moons are in the lowest part of the moon's orbit; that is, farthest south of the ecliptic; and therefore stay shortest of all above the horizon; in the columns under N, just the reverse. And, in both cases, their rising, though not at the same times, are nearly the same with regard to difference of time, as if the moon's orbit were coincident with the ecliptic.\nAt the polar circles, when the sun touches the summer tropic, he continues 24 hours above the horizon, and 24 hours below it when he touches the winter tropic. For the same reason, the full moon neither rises in summer, nor sets in winter, considering her as moving in the ecliptic. For the winter full moon being as high in the ecliptic as the summer sun, must therefore continue as long above the horizon; and the summer full moon being as low in the ecliptic as the winter sun, can no more rise than he does. But these are only the two full moons which happen about the tropics, for all the others rise and set. In summer, the full moons are low, and their stay is short above the horizon, when the nights are short, and we have least occasion for moon-light: In winter, they go high, and stay long above the horizon, when the nights are long, and we want the greatest quantity of moon-light.\n\nAt the poles, one half of the ecliptic never sets, and the other half never rises; and therefore, as the sun is always half a year in describing one half of the ecliptic, and as long in going through the other half, it is natural to imagine that the sun continues half a year together above the horizon of each pole in its turn, and as long below it, rising to one pole when he sets to the other. This would be exactly the case if there were no refraction; but by the atmosphere\u2019s refracting the sun\u2019s rays, he becomes visible some days sooner, and continues some days longer in sight than he would otherwise do: so that he appears above the horizon of either pole before he has got below the horizon of the other. And as he never goes more than $23\\frac{1}{2}$ degrees below the horizon of the poles, they have very little dark night; it being twilight there as well as at all other places till the sun be 18 degrees below the horizon. The full moon being always opposite to the sun, can never be seen while the sun is above the horizon, except when the moon falls in the northern half of her orbit; for whenever any point of the ecliptic rises, the opposite point sets. Therefore, as the sun is above the horizon of the north pole from the 20th of March till the 23d of September, it is plain, that the moon, when full, being opposite to the sun, must be below the horizon during that half of the year. But when the sun is in the southern half of the ecliptic, he never rises to the north pole, during which half of the year, every full moon happens in some part of the northern half of the ecliptic, which never sets. Consequently, as the polar inhabitants never see the full moon in summer, they have her always in the winter, before, at, and after the full, shining for 14 of our days and nights. And when the sun is at his greatest depression below the horizon, being then in Capricorn, the moon is at her first quarter in Aries; full in Cancer, and at her third quarter in Libra. And as the beginning of Aries is the rising point of the ecliptic, Cancer the highest, and Libra the setting point, the moon rises at her first quarter in Aries, is most elevated above the horizon, and full in Cancer, and sets at the beginning of Libra in her third quarter, having continued visible for 14 diurnal rotations of the earth. Thus the poles are supplied one half of the winter time with constant moon-light in the sun\u2019s absence; and only lose light of the moon from her third to her first quarter, while she gives but very little light, and could be but of little, and sometimes of no service to them. A bare view of the figure (Plate XLIV. fig. 3.) will make this plain; in which let S be the sun, e the earth in summer when its north pole n inclines toward the sun, and E the earth in winter, when its north pole declines from him. SEN and NWs is the horizon of the north pole, which is coincident with the equator; and, in both these positions of the earth, $\\varphi$ is the moon\u2019s orbit, in which she goes round the earth according to the order of the letters abcd, ABCD. When the moon is at a, she is in her third quarter to the earth at e, and just rising to the north pole n; at b she changes, and is at the greatest height above the horizon, as the sun likewise is; at c she is in her first quarter, setting below the horizon; and is lowest of all under it at d, when opposite to the sun, and her enlightened side toward the earth. But then she is full in view to the fourth pole p, which is as much turned from the sun as the north pole inclines towards him. Thus, in our summer, the moon is above the horizon of the north pole.\npole whilst she describes the northern half of the ecliptic \\( \\varphi \\) or, from her third quarter to her first; and below the horizon during her progress through the southern half \\( \\omega \\); highest at the change, most depressed at the full. But in winter, when the earth is at \\( E \\), and its north pole declines from the sun, the new moon at \\( D \\) is at her greatest depression below the horizon \\( NWS \\), and the full moon at \\( B \\) at her greatest height above it, rising at her first quarter \\( A \\), and keeping above the horizon till she comes to her third quarter \\( C \\). At a mean state she is \\( 23\\frac{1}{2} \\) degrees above the horizon at \\( B \\) and \\( b \\), and as much below it at \\( D \\) and \\( d \\), equal to the inclination of the earth's axis \\( F \\). \\( S \\) and \\( Srs \\) are, as it were, a ray of light proceeding from the sun to the earth; and shews, that when the earth is at \\( e \\), the sun is above the horizon, vertical to the tropic of Cancer; and when the earth is at \\( E \\), he is below the horizon, vertical to the tropic of Capricorn.\n\n**Chap. XV. Of the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea.**\n\nThe cause of the tides was discovered by Kepler, who, in his *Introduction to the Physics of the Heavens*, thus explains it: \"The orb of the attracting power, which is in the moon, is extended as far as the earth, and draws the waters under the torrid zone, acting upon places where it is vertical, insensibly on confined seas and bays, but sensibly on the ocean, whose bodies are large, and the waters have the liberty of reciprocation; that is, of rising and falling.\" And in the 70th page of his *Lunar Astronomy*\u2014 \"But the cause of the tides of the sea appears to be the bodies of the sun and moon drawing the waters of the sea.\" This hint being given, Sir Isaac Newton improved it, and wrote so amply on the subject, as to make the theory of the tides in a manner quite his own; by discovering the cause of their rising on the side of the earth opposite to the moon. For Kepler believed, that the presence of the moon occasioned an impulse which caused another in her absence.\n\nThe power of gravity diminishes as the square of the distance increases; and therefore the waters (Plate XLIV., fig. 4.) at \\( Z \\) on the side of the earth \\( ABCDEFGH \\) next the moon \\( M \\) are more attracted than the central parts of the earth \\( O \\) by the moon, and the central parts are more attracted by her than the waters on the opposite side of the earth at \\( n \\); and therefore the distance between the earth's centre and the waters on its surface under and opposite to the moon will be increased. For, let there be three bodies at \\( H \\), \\( O \\), and \\( D \\), if they are all equally attracted by the body \\( M \\), they will all move equally fast toward it, their mutual distances from each other continuing the same. If the attraction of \\( M \\) is unequal, then that body which is most strongly attracted will move fastest, and this will increase its distance from the other body. Therefore, by the law of gravitation, \\( M \\) will attract \\( H \\) more strongly than it does \\( O \\), by which the distance between \\( H \\) and \\( O \\) will be increased, and a spectator on \\( O \\) will perceive \\( H \\) rising higher toward \\( Z \\).\n\nIn like manner, \\( O \\) being more strongly attracted than \\( D \\), it will move farther towards \\( M \\) than \\( D \\) does; consequently the distance between \\( O \\) and \\( D \\) will be increased, and a spectator on \\( O \\), not perceiving his own motion, will see \\( D \\) receding farther from him towards \\( n \\); all effects and appearances being the same, whether \\( D \\) recedes from \\( O \\), or \\( O \\) from \\( D \\).\n\nSuppose now there is a number of bodies, as \\( ABCDEFGH \\), placed round \\( O \\), so as to form a flexible or fluid ring; then, as the whole is attracted towards \\( M \\), the parts at \\( H \\) and \\( D \\) will have their distance from \\( O \\) increased; whilst the parts at \\( B \\) and \\( F \\), being nearly at the same distance from \\( M \\) as \\( O \\) is, these parts will not recede from one another, but rather, by the oblique attraction of \\( M \\), they will approach nearer to \\( O \\). Hence the fluid ring will form itself into an ellipse \\( ZIBLnKFNZ \\), whose longer axis \\( nOZ \\) produced will pass through \\( M \\), and its shorter axis \\( BOF \\) will terminate in \\( B \\) and \\( F \\). Let the ring be filled with bodies, so as to form a fluid sphere round \\( G \\); then, as the whole moves toward \\( M \\), the fluid sphere being lengthened at \\( Z \\) and \\( n \\), will assume an oblong or oval form. If \\( M \\) is the moon, \\( O \\) the earth's centre, \\( ABCDEFGH \\) the sea covering the earth's surface, it is evident, by the above reasoning, that whilst the earth by its gravity falls toward the moon, the water directly below her at \\( B \\) will swell and rise gradually towards her; also the water at \\( D \\) will recede from the centre, (strictly speaking the centre recedes from \\( D \\)), and rise on the opposite side of the earth, whilst the water at \\( B \\) and \\( F \\) is depressed, and falls below the former level. Hence, as the earth turns round its axis from the moon to the moon again in \\( 24\\frac{1}{2} \\) hours, there will be two tides of flood and two of ebb in that time, as we find by experience.\n\nAs this explanation of the ebbing and flowing of the sea is deduced from the earth's constantly falling toward the moon by the power of gravity, some may find a difficulty in conceiving how this is possible, when the moon is full, or in opposition to the sun, since the earth revolves about the sun, and must continually fall towards it, and therefore cannot fall contrary ways at the same time; or if the earth is constantly falling towards the moon, they must come together at last. To remove this difficulty, let it be considered, that it is not the centre of the earth that describes the annual orbit round the sun, but the common centre of gravity of the earth and moon together; and that whilst the earth is moving round the sun, it also describes a circle round that centre of gravity, going as many times round it in one revolution about the sun as there are lunations or courses of the moon round the earth in a year; and therefore the earth is constantly falling towards the moon from a tangent to the circle it describes round the said common centre of gravity. In Plate XLV., fig. 1., let \\( M \\) be the moon, \\( TW \\) part of the moon's orbit; and \\( G \\) the centre of gravity of the earth and moon; whilst the moon goes round her orbit, the centre of the earth describes the circle \\( ged \\) round \\( C \\), to which circle \\( gak \\) is a tangent; and therefore when the moon has gone from \\( M \\) to a little past \\( W \\), the earth has moved from \\( g \\) to \\( e \\); and in that time...\ntime has fallen towards the moon, from the tangent at \\(a\\) to \\(c\\), and so round the whole circle.\n\nThe sun's influence in raising the tides is but small in comparison of the moon's: For though the earth's diameter bears a considerable proportion to its distance from the moon, it is next to nothing when compared with the distance of the sun. And therefore, the difference of the sun's attraction on the sides of the earth under and opposite to him, is much less than the difference of the moon's attraction on the sides of the earth under and opposite to her; and therefore the moon must raise the tides much higher than they can be raised by the sun.\n\nOn this theory, so far as we have explained it, the tides ought to be highest directly under and opposite to the moon; that is, when the moon is due north and south. But we find, that in open seas, where the water flows freely, the moon \\(M\\) (Plate XLIV. fig. 4.) is generally past the north and south meridian, as at \\(p\\), when it is high water at \\(Z\\) and at \\(n\\). The reason is obvious; for though the moon's attraction was to cease altogether when she was past the meridian, yet the motion of ascent communicated to the water before that time would make it continue to rise for some time after; much more must it do so when the attraction is only diminished; as a little impulse given to a moving ball will cause it still to move farther than otherwise it could have done. And as experience shews, that the day is hotter about three in the afternoon, than when the sun is on the meridian, because of the increment made to the heat already imparted.\n\nThe tides answer not always to the same distance of the moon from the meridian at the same places, but are variously affected by the action of the sun, which brings them on sooner when the moon is in her first and third quarters, and keeps them back later when she is in her second and fourth; because in the former case the tide raised by the sun alone would be earlier than the tide raised by the moon, and in the latter case later.\n\nThe moon goes round the earth in an elliptic orbit, and therefore she approaches nearer to the earth than her mean distance, and recedes farther from it, in every lunar month. When she is nearest, she attracts strongest, and so raises the tides most; the contrary happens when she is farthest, because of her weaker attraction. When both luminaries are in the equator, and the moon in Perigee, or at her least distance from the earth, she raises the tides highest of all, especially at her conjunction and opposition; both because the equatorial parts have the greatest centrifugal force from their describing the largest circle, and from the concurring actions of the sun and moon. At the change, the attractive forces of the sun and moon being united, they diminish the gravity of the waters under the moon, and their gravity on the opposite side is diminished by means of a greater centrifugal force. At the full, whilst the moon raises the tide under and opposite to her, the sun acting in the same line, raises the tide under and opposite to him; whence their conjoint effect is the same as at the change; and in both cases, occasion what we call the spring-tides. But at the quarters, the sun's action on the waters at \\(O\\) and \\(H\\) (Plate XLV. fig. 2.) diminishes the effect of the moon's action on the waters at \\(Z\\) and \\(N\\); so that they rise a little under and opposite to the sun at \\(O\\) and \\(H\\), and fall as much under and opposite to the moon at \\(Z\\) and \\(N\\), making what we call the neap-tides, because the sun and moon then act cross-wise to each other. But, strictly speaking, these tides happen not till some time after; because in this, as in other cases, the actions do not produce the greatest effect when they are at the strongest, but some time afterward.\n\nThe sun being nearer the earth in winter than in summer, is of course nearer to it in February and October than in March and September; and therefore the greatest tides happen not till some time after the autumnal equinox, and return a little before the vernal.\n\nThe sea being thus put in motion, would continue to ebb and flow for several times, even though the sun and moon were annihilated, or their influence should cease; as if a basin of water were agitated, the water would continue to move for some time after the basin was left to stand still. Or like a pendulum, which having been put in motion by the hand, continues to make several vibrations without any new impulse.\n\nWhen the moon is in the equator, the tides are equally high in both parts of the lunar day, or time of the moon's revolving from the meridian to the meridian again, which is 24 hours 48 minutes. But as the moon declines from the equator towards either pole, the tides are alternately higher and lower at places having north or south latitude. For one of the highest elevations, which is that under the moon, follows her towards the pole to which she is nearest, and the other declines towards the opposite pole; each elevation describing parallels as far distant from the equator, on opposite sides, as the moon declines from it to either side; and consequently, the parallels described by these elevations of the water are twice as many degrees from one another, as the moon is from the equator; increasing their distance as the moon increases her declination, till it be at the greatest, when the said parallels are, at a mean state, 47 degrees from one another; and on that day, the tides are most unequal in their heights. As the moon returns toward the equator, the parallels described by the opposite elevations approach towards each other, until the moon comes to the equator, and then they coincide. As the moon declines toward the opposite pole, at equal distances, each elevation describes the same parallel in the other part of the lunar day, which its opposite elevation described before. Whilst the moon has north declination, the greatest tides in the northern hemisphere are when she is above the horizon; and the reverse whilst her declination is south. In Plate XLV. let \\(NESQ\\) be the earth, \\(NGS\\) its axis, \\(EQ\\) the equator, \\(TBC\\) the tropic of Cancer, \\(TRS\\) the tropic of Capricorn, \\(ab\\) the arctic circle, \\(cd\\) the antarctic, \\(N\\) the north pole, \\(S\\) the south pole, \\(M\\) the moon, \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) the two eminences of water, whose lowest parts are at \\(a\\) and \\(d\\) (fig. 3.), at \\(N\\) and \\(S\\) (fig. 4.), and at \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) (fig. 5.), always 90 degrees from the highest. Now when the moon is in her greatest north declination at \\(M\\), the highest elevation \\(G\\) under her, is on the tropic of Cancer, \\(TBC\\), and the opposite elevation \\(F\\) on the tropic of Capricorn \\(TRS\\); and these two elevations describe the tropics.\npicks by the earth's diurnal rotation. All places in the northern hemisphere ENQ have the highest tides when they come into the position bEQ, under the moon; and the lowest tides when the earth's diurnal rotation carries them into the position aTE, on the side opposite to the moon; the reverse happens at the same time in the southern hemisphere ESQ, as is evident to sight.\n\nThe axis of the tides acd has now its poles a and d (being always 90 degrees from the highest elevations) in the arctic and antarctic circles; and therefore it is plain, that at these circles there is but one tide of flood, and one of ebb, in the lunar day. For, when the point a revolves half round to b, in 12 lunar hours, it has a tide of flood; but when it comes to the same point a again in 12 hours more, it has the lowest ebb. In seven days afterward, the moon M comes to the equinoctial circle, and is over the equator EQ, when both elevations describe the equator; and in both hemispheres, at equal distances from the equator, the tides are equally high in both parts of the lunar day. The whole phenomena being reversed, when the moon has south declination, to what they were when her declination was north, require no farther description.\n\nIn Plate XLV, fig. 3-4, 5, the earth is orthographically projected on the plane of the meridian; but in order to describe a particular phenomenon, we now project it on the plane of the ecliptic. In the same Plate fig. 2, let HZON be the earth and sea, FED the equator, T the tropic of Cancer, C the arctic circle, P the north pole, and the curves 1 2 3, &c., 24 meridians, or hour-circles, intersecting each other in the poles; AGM is the moon's orbit, S the Sun, M the moon, Z the water elevated under the moon, and N the opposite equal elevation. As the lowest parts of the water are always 90 degrees from the highest, when the moon is in either of the tropics, (as at M), the elevation Z is on the tropic of Capricorn, and the opposite elevation N on the tropic of Cancer, the low-water circle HCO touches the polar circles at C; and the high-water circle ETP6 goes over the poles at P, and divides every parallel of latitude into two equal segments. In this case the tides upon every parallel are alternately higher and lower; but they return in equal times: The point T, for example, on the tropic of Cancer, (where the depth of the tide is represented by the breadth of the dark shade), has a shallower tide of flood at T than when it revolves half round from thence to 6, according to the order of the numeral figures; but it revolves as soon from 6 to T as it did from T to 6. When the moon is in the equinoctial, the elevations Z and N are transferred to the equator at O and H, and the high and low-water circles are got into each other's former places; in which case the tides return in unequal times, but are equally high in both parts of the lunar day: for a place at 1 (under D) revolving as formerly, goes sooner from 1 to 11, (under F), than from 11 to 1, because the parallel it describes is cut into unequal segments by the high-water circle HCO; but the points 1 and 11 being equidistant from the pole of the tides at C, which is directly under the pole of the moon's orbit MOA, the elevations are equally high in both parts of the day.\n\nAnd thus it appears, that as the tides are governed by the moon, they must turn on the axis of the moon's orbit, which is inclined 23\u00bd degrees to the earth's axis at a mean rate; and therefore the poles of the tides must be so many degrees from the poles of the earth, or in opposite points of the polar circles, going round these circles in every lunar day. It is true, that, according to Plate XLV, fig. 4, when the moon is vertical to the equator EQ, the poles of the tides seem to fall in with the poles of the world N and S; but when we consider that FHG is under the moon's orbit, it will appear, that when the moon is over H, in the tropic of Capricorn, the north pole of the tides (which can be no more than 90 degrees from under the moon) must be at c in the arctic circle, not at N, the north pole of the earth; and as the moon ascends from H to G in her orbit, the north pole of the tides must shift from c to a in the arctic circle, and the south pole as much in the antarctic.\n\nIt is not to be doubted, but that the earth's quick rotation brings the poles of the tides nearer to the poles of the world, than they would be if the earth were at rest, and the moon revolved about it only once a month; for otherwise the tides would be more unequal in their heights, and times of their returns, than we find they are. But how near the earth's rotation may bring the poles of its axis and those of the tides together, or how far the preceding tides may affect those which follow, so as to make them keep up nearly to the same heights, and times of ebbing and flowing, is a problem more fit to be solved by observation than by theory.\n\nThose who have opportunity to make observations, and choose to satisfy themselves whether the tides are really affected in the above manner by the different positions of the moon, especially as to the unequal times of their returns, may take this general rule for knowing when they ought to be so affected. When the earth's axis inclines to the moon, the northern tides, if not retarded in their passage through shoals and channels, nor affected by the winds, ought to be greatest when the moon is above the horizon, least when she is below it, and quite the reverse when the earth's axis declines from her; but, in both cases, at equal intervals of time. When the earth's axis inclines sidewise to the moon, both tides are equally high, but they happen at unequal intervals of time. In every lunation the earth's axis inclines once to the moon, once from her, and twice sidewise to her, as it does to the sun every year; because the moon goes round the ecliptic every month, and the sun but once in a year. In summer, the earth's axis inclines towards the moon when new; and therefore the day-tides in the north ought to be highest, and night-tides lowest about the change; at the full the reverse. At the quarters they ought to be equally high, but unequal in their returns; because the earth's axis then inclines sidewise to the moon. In winter the phenomena are the same at full-moon as in summer at new. In autumn the earth's axis inclines sidewise to the moon when new and full; therefore the tides ought to be equally high, and unequal in their returns at these times. At the first quarter the tides of flood should be least when the moon is above the horizon, greatest when she is below it; and the reverse.\nat her third quarter. In spring, the phenomena of the first quarter answer to those of the third quarter in autumn; and vice versa. The nearer any time is to either of these seasons, the more the tides partake of the phenomena of these seasons; and in the middle between any two of them the tides are at a mean state between those of both.\n\nIn open seas, the tides rise but to very small heights in proportion to what they do in wide-mouthed rivers, opening in the direction of the stream of tide. For, in channels growing narrower gradually, the water is accumulated by the opposition of the contracting bank; like a gentle wind, little felt on an open plain, but strong and brisk in a street; especially if the wider end of the street be next the plain, and in the way of the wind.\n\nThe tides are so retarded in their passage through different shoals and channels, and otherwise so variously affected by striking against capes and headlands, that to different places they happen at all distances of the moon from the meridian; consequently at all hours of the lunar day. The tide propagated by the moon in the German ocean, when she is three hours past the meridian, takes 12 hours to come from thence to London-Bridge; where it arrives by the time that a new tide is raised in the ocean. And therefore when the moon has north declination, and we should expect the tide at London to be greatest when the moon is above the horizon, we find it is least; and the contrary when she has south declination. At several places it is high water three hours before the moon comes to the meridian; but that tide which the moon pushes as it were before her, is only the tide opposite to that which was raised by her when she was nine hours past the opposite meridian.\n\nThere are no tides in lakes, because they are generally so small, that when the moon is vertical she attracts every part of them alike, and therefore, by rendering all the water equally light, no part of it can be raised higher than another. The Mediterranean and Baltic seas suffer very small elevations, because the inlets by which they communicate with the ocean are so narrow, that they cannot, in so short a time, receive or discharge enough to raise or sink their surfaces sensibly.\n\nAir being lighter than water, and the surface of the atmosphere being nearer to the moon than the surface of the sea, it cannot be doubted that the moon raises much higher tides in the air than in the sea. And therefore many have wondered why the mercury does not sink in the barometer when the moon's action on the particles of air makes them lighter as she passes over the meridian. But we must consider, that as these particles are rendered lighter, a greater number of them is accumulated, until the deficiency of gravity be made up by the height of the column; and then there is an equilibrium, and consequently an equal pressure upon the mercury as before; so that it cannot be affected by the aerial tides.\n\n**CHAP. XVI. Of Eclipses: Their Number and Periods. A large Catalogue of ancient and modern Eclipses.**\n\nEvery planet and satellite is illuminated by the sun; and casts a shadow towards that point of the heavens which is opposite to the sun. This shadow is nothing but a privation of light in the space hid from the sun by the opaque body that intercepts his rays.\n\nWhen the sun's light is so intercepted by the moon, that to any place of the earth the sun appears partly or wholly covered, he is said to undergo an eclipse; though, properly speaking, it is only an eclipse of that part of the earth where the moon's shadow or penumbra falls. When the earth comes between the sun and moon, the moon falls into the earth's shadow; and, having no light of her own, she suffers a real eclipse from the interception of the sun's rays. When the sun is eclipsed to us, the moon's inhabitants, on the side next the earth, see her shadow like a dark spot travelling over the earth, about twice as fast as its equatorial parts move, and the same way as they move. When the moon is in an eclipse, the sun appears eclipsed to her, total to all those parts on which the earth's shadow falls, and of as long continuance as they are in the shadow.\n\nThat the earth is spherical (for the hills take off no more from the roundness of the earth, than grains of dust do from the roundness of a common globe) is evident from the figure of its shadow on the moon; which is always bounded by a circular line, although the earth is incessantly turning its different sides to the moon, and very seldom shews the same side to her in different eclipses, because they seldom happen at the same hours. Were the earth shaped like a round flat plate, its shadow would only be circular when either of its sides directly faced the moon; and more or less elliptical as the earth happened to be turned more or less obliquely towards the moon when she is eclipsed. The moon's different phases prove her to be round; for, as she keeps still the same side towards the earth, if that side were flat, as it appears to be, she would never be visible from the third quarter to the first; and from the first quarter to the third, she would appear as round as when we say she is full; because, at the end of her first quarter, the sun's light would come as suddenly on all her side next the earth, as it does on a flat wall, and go off as abruptly at the end of her third quarter.\n\nIf the earth and sun were equally large, the earth's shadow would be infinitely extended, and all of the same bulk; and the planet Mars, in either of its nodes and opposite to the sun, would be eclipsed in the earth's shadow. Were the earth larger than the sun, its shadow would increase in bulk the farther it extended, and would eclipse the great planets Jupiter and Saturn, with all their moons, when they were opposite to the sun. But as Mars, in opposition, never falls into the earth's shadow, although he is not then above 42 millions of miles from the earth, it is plain that the earth is much less than the sun; for otherwise its shadow could not end in a point at so small a distance. If the sun and moon were equally large, the moon's shadow would go on to the earth with an equal breadth, and cover a portion of the earth's surface more than 2000 miles broad, even if it fell directly against the earth's centre, as seen from the moon; and much more if it fell obliquely on the earth: But the moon's shadow is seldom 150 miles broad at the earth, unless when it falls very\nvery obliquely on the earth, in total eclipses of the sun. In annular eclipses, the moon's real shadow ends in a point at some distance from the earth. The moon's small distance from the earth, and the shortness of her shadow, prove her to be less than the sun. And, as the earth's shadow is large enough to cover the moon, if her diameter were three times as large as it is (which is evident from her long continuance in the shadow when she goes through its centre) it is plain, that the earth is much bigger than the moon.\n\nThough all opaque bodies, on which the sun shines, have their shadows, yet such is the bulk of the sun, and the distances of the planets, that the primary planets can never eclipse one another. A primary can eclipse only its secondary, or be eclipsed by it; and never but when in opposition or conjunction with the sun. The primary planets are very seldom in these positions, but the sun and moon are so every month: Whence one may imagine, that these two luminaries should be eclipsed every month. But there are few eclipses in respect of the number of new and full moons; the reason of which we shall now explain.\n\nIf the moon's orbit were coincident with the plane of the ecliptic, in which the earth always moves and the sun appears to move, the moon's shadow would fall upon the earth at every change, and eclipse the sun to some parts of the earth. In like manner, the moon would go through the middle of the earth's shadow, and be eclipsed at every full; but with this difference, that she would be totally darkened for above an hour and a half; whereas the sun never was above four minutes totally eclipsed by the interposition of the moon. But one half of the moon's orbit is elevated $5\\frac{1}{2}$ degrees above the ecliptic, and the other half as much depressed below it; consequently, the moon's orbit intersects the ecliptic in two opposite points called the moon's nodes, as has been already taken notice of. When these points are in a right line with the centre of the sun at new or full moon, the sun, moon, and earth, are all in a right line; and if the moon be then new, her shadow falls upon the earth; if full, the earth's shadow falls upon her. When the sun and moon are more than 17 degrees from either of the nodes at the time of conjunction, the moon is then generally too high or too low in her orbit to cast any part of her shadow upon the earth; when the sun is more than 12 deg. from either of the nodes at the time of full moon, the moon is generally too high or too low in her orbit to go thro' any part of the earth's shadow: And in both these cases there will be no eclipse. But when the moon is less than 17 degrees from either node at the time of conjunction, her shadow or penumbra falls more or less upon the earth, as she is more or less within this limit. And when she is less than 12 degrees from either node at the time of opposition, she goes through a greater or less portion of the earth's shadow, as she is more or less within this limit. Her orbit contains 360 degrees; of which 17, the limit of solar eclipses on either side of the nodes, and 12, the limit of lunar eclipses, are but small portions: And as the sun commonly passes by the nodes but twice in a year, it is no wonder that we have so many new and full moons without eclipses.\n\nTo illustrate this, (Plate XLVI. fig. 1.) let $ABCD$ be the ecliptic, $RSTU$ a circle lying in the same plane with the ecliptic, and $VWXYZ$ the moon's orbit, all thrown into an oblique view, which gives them an elliptical shape to the eye. One half of the moon's orbit, as $VWX$, is always below the ecliptic, and the other half $XYZ$ above it. The points $V$ and $X$, where the moon's orbit intersects the circle $RSTU$, which lies even with the ecliptic, are the moon's nodes; and a right line, as $XEV$, drawn from one to the other, through the earth's centre, is the line of the nodes, which is carried almost parallel to itself round the sun in a year.\n\nIf the moon moved round the earth in the orbit $RSTU$, which is coincident with the plane of the ecliptic, her shadow would fall upon the earth every time she is in conjunction with the sun, and at every opposition she would go through the earth's shadow. Were this the case, the sun would be eclipsed at every change, and the moon at every full, as already mentioned.\n\nBut although the moon's shadow $N$ must fall upon the earth at $a$, when the earth is at $E$, and the moon in conjunction with the sun at $i$, because she is then very near one of her nodes; and at her opposition $n$ she must go through the earth's shadow $I$, because she is then near the other node; yet, in the time that she goes round the earth to her next change, according to the order of the letters $XTVW$, the earth advances from $E$ to $e$, according to the order of the letters $EFGH$, and the line of the nodes $VEX$ being carried nearly parallel to itself, brings the point $f$ of the moon's orbit in conjunction with the sun at that next change; and then the moon being at $f$, is too high above the ecliptic to cast her shadow on the earth: And as the earth is still moving forward, the moon at her next opposition will be at $g$, too far below the ecliptic to go through any part of the earth's shadow; for by that time the point $g$ will be at a considerable distance from the earth as seen from the sun.\n\nWhen the earth comes to $F$, the moon in conjunction with the sun $Z$ is not at $k$ in a plane coincident with the ecliptic, but above it at $Y$ in the highest part of her orbit; and then the point $b$ of her shadow $O$ goes far above the earth (as in fig. 2., which is an edge view of fig. 1.) The moon, at her next opposition, is not at $o$ (fig. 1.) but at $W$, where the earth's shadow goes far above her (as in fig. 2.) In both these cases the line of the nodes $VFX$ (fig. 1.) is about 90 degrees from the sun, and both luminaries are as far as possible from the limits of the eclipses.\n\nWhen the earth has gone half round the ecliptic from $E$ to $G$, the line of the nodes $VGX$ is nearly, if not exactly, directed towards the sun at $Z$; and then the newmoon $l$ casts her shadow $P$ on the earth $G$; and the full moon $p$ goes through the earth's shadow $L$; which brings on eclipses again, as when the earth was at $E$.\n\nWhen the earth comes to $H$, the new moon falls not at $m$ in a plane coincident with the ecliptic $CD$, but at $W$ in her orbit below it; and then her shadow $Q$ (see fig. 2.) goes far below the earth. At the next full she is not at $q$ (fig. 1.) but at $Y$ in her orbit $5\\frac{1}{2}$ degrees above $q$, and at her greatest height above the ecliptic $CD$; being then as far as possible, at any opposition, from the earth's shadow $M$, as in fig. 2.\n\nSo, when the earth is at $E$ and $G$, the moon is about\nHer nodes at new and full; and in her greatest north and south declination (or latitude, as it is generally called) from the ecliptic at her quarters: But when the earth is at F or H, the moon is in her greatest north and south declination from the ecliptic at new and full, and in the nodes about her quarters.\n\nThe point X where the moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic, is called the ascending node, because the moon ascends from it above the ecliptic: And the opposite point of intersection V is called the descending node, because the moon descends from it below the ecliptic. When the moon is at Y in the highest point of her orbit, she is in her greatest north latitude; and when she is at W in the lowest point of her orbit, she is in her greatest south latitude.\n\nIf the line of the nodes, like the earth's axis, was carried parallel to itself round the sun, there would be just half a year between the conjunctions of the sun and nodes. But the nodes shift backward, or contrary to the earth's annual motion, \\(19\\frac{2}{3}\\) deg. every year; and therefore the same node comes round to the sun 19 days sooner every year than on the year before. Consequently, from the time that the ascending node X (when the earth is at E) passes by the sun as seen from the earth, it is only 173 days (not half a year) till the descending node V passes by him. Therefore, in whatever time of the year we have eclipses of the luminaries about either node, we may be sure that in 173 days afterward we shall have eclipses about the other node. And when at any time of the year the line of the nodes is in the situation VGX, at the same time next year it will be in the situation rGs; the ascending node having gone backward, that is, contrary to the order of signs, from X to r, and the descending node from V to r; each \\(19\\frac{2}{3}\\) deg. At this rate the nodes shift through all the signs and degrees of the ecliptic in 18 years and 225 days; in which time there would always be a regular period of eclipses, if any complete number of lunations were finished without a fraction. But this never happens; for if both the sun and moon should start from a line of conjunction with either of the nodes in any point of the ecliptic, the sun would perform 18 annual revolutions and 222 degrees over and above, and the moon 230 lunations and 85 degrees of the 231st, by the time the node came round to the same point of the ecliptic again: So that the sun would then be 138 degrees from the node, and the moon 85 degrees from the sun.\n\nBut, in 223 mean lunations, after the sun, moon, and nodes, have been once in a line of conjunction, they return so nearly to the same state again, as that the same node, which was in conjunction with the sun and moon at the beginning of the first of these lunations, will be within \\(28'12''\\) of a degree of a line of conjunction with the sun and moon again, when the last of these lunations is completed. And therefore, in that time there will be a regular period of eclipses, or return of the same eclipse, for many ages.\u2014In this period, (which was first discovered by the Chaldeans), there are 18 Julian years 11 days 7 hours 43 minutes 20 seconds, when the last day of February in leap-years is four times included:\n\nBut when it is five times included, the period consists of only 18 years 10 days 7 hours 43 minutes 20 seconds. Consequently, if to the mean time of any eclipse, either of the sun or moon, you add 18 Julian years 11 days 7 hours 43 minutes 20 seconds, when the last day of February in leap-years comes in four times, or a day less when it comes in five times, you will have the mean time of the return of the same eclipse.\n\nBut the falling back of the line, or conjunctions, or oppositions of the sun and moon \\(28'12''\\) with respect to the line of the nodes in every period, will wear it out in process of time; and after that, it will not return again in less than 12492 years.\u2014These eclipses of the sun, which happen about the ascending node, and begin to come in at the north pole of the earth, will go a little southerly at each return, till they go quite off the earth at the south pole; and those which happen about the descending node, and begin to come in at the south pole of the earth, will go a little northerly at each return, till at last they quite leave the earth at the north pole.\n\nTo exemplify this matter, we shall first consider the sun's eclipse, (March 21st old style, April 1st new style), A.D. 1764, according to its mean revolutions, without equating the times, or the sun's distance from the node; and then according to its true equated times.\n\nThis eclipse fell in open space at each return, quite clear of the earth, even since the creation, till A.D. 1295, June 13th old style, at 12 h. 52 m. 59 sec. p.m. meridian, when the moon's shadow first touched the earth at the north pole; the sun being then \\(17'48''27''\\) from the ascending node.\u2014In each period since that time, the sun has come \\(28'12''\\) nearer and nearer the same node, and the moon's shadow has therefore gone more and more southerly.\u2014In the year 1962, July 18th old style, at 10 h. 36 m. 21 sec. p.m., when the same eclipse will have returned 38 times, the sun will be only \\(24'45''\\) from the ascending node, and the centre of the moon's shadow will fall a little northward of the earth's centre.\u2014At the end of the next following period, A.D. 1980, July 28th old style, at 18 h. 19 m. 41 sec. p.m. the sun will have receded back \\(3'27''\\) from the ascending node, and the moon will have a very small degree of southern latitude, which will cause the centre of her shadow to pass a very small matter south of the earth's centre.\u2014After which, in every following period, the sun will be \\(28'12''\\) farther back from the ascending node than in the period last before; and the moon's shadow will go still farther and farther southward, until September 12th old style, at 23 h. 46 m. 22 sec. p.m. A.D. 2665; when the eclipse will have completed its 77th periodical return, and will go quite off the earth at the south pole (the sun being then \\(17'55'22''\\) back from the node), and cannot come in at the north pole, so as to begin the same course over again, in less than 12492 years afterward.\u2014And such will be the case of every other eclipse of the sun: For, as there is about 18 degrees on each side of the node within which there is a possibility of eclipses, their whole revolution goes through 36 degrees about that node, which, taken from 360 degrees, leaves remaining \\(324\\) degrees for the eclipses to travel in ex-\nAnd as this 26 degrees is not gone through in less than 77 periods, which takes up 1388 years, the remaining 324 degrees cannot be so gone through in less than 12492 years. For, as 36 is to 1388, so is 324 to 12492.\n\nTo illustrate this a little farther, we shall examine some of the most remarkable circumstances of the returns of the eclipse which happened July 14th 1748, about noon. This eclipse, after traversing the voids of space from the creation, at last began to enter the Terra Australis Incognita about 88 years after the conquest, which was the last of king Stephen's reign; every Chaldean period it has crept more northerly, but was still invisible in Britain before the year 1622; when, on the 30th of April, it began to touch the south parts of England about 2 in the afternoon; its central appearance rising in the American south seas, and traversing Peru and the Amazon's country, through the Atlantic ocean into Africa, and setting in the Ethiopian continent, not far from the beginning of the Red sea.\n\nIts next visible period was after three Chaldean revolutions in 1676, on the first of June, rising central in the Atlantic ocean, passing us about 9 in the morning, with four digits eclipsed on the under limb, and setting in the gulf of Cochinchina in the East Indies.\n\nIt being now near the solstice, this eclipse was visible the very next return in 1694, in the evening; and in two periods more, which was in 1730, on the 4th of July, was seen about half eclipsed just after sunrise, and observed both at W\u00fcrtemberg in Germany, and Pekin in China, soon after which it went off.\n\nEighteen years more afforded us the eclipse which fell on the 14th of July 1748.\n\nThe next visible return happened on July 25th 1766, in the evening, about four digits eclipsed; and after two periods more, will happen on August 16th 1802, early in the morning, about five digits, the centre coming from the north frozen continent, by the capes of Norway, through Tartary China and Japan, to the Ladron islands, where it goes off.\n\nAgain, in 1820, August 26th, between one and two, there will be another great eclipse at London, about 10 digits; but, happening so near the equinox, the centre will leave every part of Britain to the west, and enter Germany at Emden, passing by Venice, Naples, Grand Cairo, and set in the gulf of Baffra near that city.\n\nIt will be no more visible till 1874, when five digits will be obscured (the centre being now about to leave the earth) on September 28th. In 1892, the sun will go down eclipsed in London; and again, in 1928, the passage of the centre will be in the expansum, though there will be two digits eclipsed at London, October the 31st of that year, and about the year 2090 the whole penumbra will be wore off; whence no more returns of this eclipse can happen till after a revolution of 10 thousand years.\n\nFrom these remarks on the entire revolution of this eclipse, we may gather, that a thousand years, more or less, (for there are some irregularities that may protract or lengthen this period 100 years), complete the whole terrestrial phenomena of any single eclipse: and since 20 periods of 54 years each, and about 33 days, comprehend the entire extent of their revolution, it is evident, that the times of the returns will pass through a circuit of one year and ten months, every Chaldean period being ten or eleven days later, and of the equable appearances, about 32 or 33 days. Thus, though this eclipse happens about the middle of July, no other subsequent eclipse of this period will return till the middle of the same month again; but wear constantly each period 10 or 11 days forward, and at last appear in winter, but then it begins to cease from affecting us.\n\nAnother conclusion from this revolution may be drawn, that there will seldom be any more than two great eclipses of the sun in the interval of this period, and these follow sometimes next return, and often at greater distances. That of 1715 returned again in 1733 very great; but this present eclipse will not be great till the arrival of 1820, which is a revolution of four Chaldean periods; so that the irregularities of their circuits must undergo new computations to assign them exactly.\n\nNor do all eclipses come in at the south pole: That depends altogether on the position of the lunar nodes, which will bring in as many from the expansum one way as the other; and such eclipses will wear more southerly by degrees, contrary to what happens in the present case.\n\nThe eclipse, for example, of 1736 in September, had its centre in the expansum, and let about the middle of its obscurity in Britain; it will wear in at the north pole, and in the year 2600, or thereabouts, go off into the expansum on the south side of the earth.\n\nThe eclipses therefore which happened about the creation are little more than half way yet of their ethereal circuit; and will be 4000 years before they enter the earth any more. This grand revolution seems to have been entirely unknown to the ancients.\n\nIt is particularly to be noted, that eclipses which have happened many centuries ago, will not be found by our present tables to agree exactly with ancient observations, by reason of the great anomalies in the lunar motions; which appears an incontrovertible demonstration of the non-eternity of the universe. For it seems confirmed by undeniable proofs, that the moon now finishes her period in less time than formerly, and will continue, by the centripetal law, to approach nearer and nearer the earth, and to go sooner and sooner round it. Nor will the centrifugal power be sufficient to compensate the different gravitations of such an assemblage of bodies as constitute the solar system, which would come to ruin of itself, without some new regulation and adjustment of their original motions.\n\n* There are two ancient eclipses of the moon, recorded by Ptolemy from Hipparchus, which afford an undeniable proof of the moon's acceleration. The first of these was observed at Babylon, Decem. 22d, in the year before Christ 383; when the moon began to be eclipsed, about half an hour before the sun rose, and the eclipse was not...\nWe are credibly informed from the testimony of the ancients, that there was a total eclipse of the sun predicted by Thales to happen in the fourth year of the 48th Olympiad, either at Sardis or Miletus in Asia, where Thales then resided. That year corresponds to the 585th year before Christ; when accordingly there happened a very signal eclipse of the sun, on the 28th of May, answering to the present 10th of that month, central through North America, the south parts of France, Italy, &c., as far as Athens, or the isles in the Aegean sea; which is the fartherst that even the Caroline tables carry it; and consequently make it invisible to any part of Asia, in the total character; though there are good reasons to believe that it extended to Babylon, and went down central over that city. We are not however to imagine, that it was set before it past Sardis and the Asiatic towns, where the predictor lived; because an invisible eclipse could have been of no service to demonstrate his ability in astronomical sciences to his countrymen, as it could give no proof of its reality.\n\nFor a farther illustration, Thucydides relates, That a solar eclipse happened on a summer's day in the afternoon, in the first year of the Peloponnesian war, so great, that the stars appeared. Rhodius was victor in the Olympic games the fourth year of the said war, being also the fourth of the 87th Olympiad, on the 428th year before Christ. So that the eclipse must have happened in the 431st year before Christ; and by computation it appears, that on the third of August there was a signal eclipse which would have past over Athens, central about 6 in the evening, but which our present tables bring no farther than the ancient Syrtes on the African coast, above 400 miles from Athens; which suffering in that case but 9 digits, could by no means exhibit the remarkable darkness recited by this historian; the centre therefore seems to have past Athens about 6 in the evening, and probably might go down about Jerusalem, or near it, contrary to the construction of the present tables. These things are only obviated by way of caution to the present astronomers, in re-computing ancient eclipses; and they may examine the eclipse of Nicias, so fatal to the Athenian fleet; that which overthrew the Macedonian army, &c.\n\nIn any year, the number of eclipses of both luminaries cannot be less than two, nor more than seven; the most usual number is four, and it is very rare to have more than six. For the sun passes by both the nodes but once a-year, unless he passes by one of them in the beginning of the year; and if he does, he will pass by the same node again a little before the year be finished; because, as these points move 19\u00b0 degrees backward every year, the sun will come to either of them 173 days after the other. And when either node is within 17 degrees of the sun at the time of new moon, the sun will be eclipsed. At the subsequent opposition, the moon will be eclipsed in the other node, and come round to the next conjunction again ere the former node be 17 degrees past the sun, and will therefore eclipse him again. When three eclipses fall about either node, the like-number generally falls about the opposite; as the sun comes to it in 173 days afterward; and six lunations contain but four days more. Thus, there may be two eclipses of the sun, and one of the moon, about each of her nodes. But when the moon changes in either of the nodes, she cannot be near enough the other node at the next full to be eclipsed; and in six lunar months afterward she will change near the other node: in these cases there can be but two eclipses in a year, and they are both of the sun.\n\nA longer period than the above mentioned, for comparing and examining eclipses which happen at long intervals of time, is 557 years, 21 days, 18 hours, 30 minutes, 11 seconds; in which time there are 6890 mean lunations; and the sun and moon meet again so nearly as to be but 11 seconds distant; but then it is not the same eclipse that returns, as in the shorter period above mentioned.\n\nA List of Eclipses, and historical Events, which happened about the same times, from Ricciolus.\n\n| Before Christ | Date       |\n|---------------|------------|\n| 754           | July 5     |\n| 721           | March 19   |\n\nBut, according to an old calendar, this eclipse of the sun was on the 21st of April, on which day the foundations of Rome were laid; if we may believe Taruntius Firmianus.\n\nA total eclipse of the moon. The Assyrian empire at an end; the Babylonian established.\n\nnot over before the moon set: But, by most of our astronomical tables, the moon was set at Babylon half an hour before the eclipse began; in which case, there could have been no possibility of observing it. The second eclipse was observed at Alexandria, Septem. 22d, the year before Christ 201; where the moon rose so much eclipsed, that the eclipse must have begun about half an hour before she rose: Whereas, by most of our tables, the beginning of this eclipse was not till about 10 minutes after the moon rose at Alexandria. Had these eclipses begun and ended while the sun was below the horizon, we might have imagined, that as the ancients had no certain way of measuring time, they might have been so far mistaken in the hours, that we could not have laid any stress on the accounts given by them. But as, in the first eclipse, the moon was set, and consequently the sun risen, before it was over; and in the second eclipse the sun was set, and the moon not risen, till some time after it began; these are such circumstances as the observers could not possibly be mistaken in. Mr Struyk, in the following catalogue, notwithstanding the express words of Ptolemy, puts down these two eclipses as observed at Athens; where they might have been seen as above, without any acceleration of the moon's motion, Athens being 20 degrees west of Babylon, and 7 degrees west of Alexandria.\nAn eclipse of the sun foretold by Thales, by which a peace was brought about between the Medes and Lydians.\n\nAn eclipse of the moon, which was followed by the death of Cambyses.\n\nAn eclipse of the moon, which was followed by the slaughter of the Sabines, and death of Valerius Publicola.\n\nAn eclipse of the sun. The Persian war, and the falling off of the Persians from the Egyptians.\n\nAn eclipse of the moon, which was followed by a great famine at Rome; and the beginning of the Peloponnesian war.\n\nA total eclipse of the sun. A comet and plague at Athens.\n\nA total eclipse of the moon. Nicias with his ship destroyed at Syracuse.\n\nAn eclipse of the sun. The Persians beat by Conon in a sea-engagement.\n\nA total eclipse of the moon. The next day Perseus, king of Macedonia, was conquered by Paulus Emilius.\n\nAn eclipse of the sun. This is reckoned among the prodigies, on account of the murder of Agrippinus by Nero.\n\nA total eclipse of the sun. A sign that the reign of the Gordiani would not continue long. A sixth persecution of the Christians.\n\nAn eclipse of the sun. The stars were seen, and the emperor Constantius died.\n\nA dreadful eclipse of the sun. And Lewis the Pious died within six months after it.\n\nAn eclipse of the sun. And Jerusalem taken by the Saracens.\n\nA terrible eclipse of the sun. The stars were seen. A schism in the church, occasioned by there being three Popes at once.\n\nWe have not enumerated one half of Ricciolus's list of portentous eclipses; and for the same reason that he declines giving any more of them than what that list contains, namely, that it is most disagreeable to dwell any longer on such nonsense: the superstition of the ancients may be seen by the few here copied.\n\nEclipses of the sun are more frequent than of the moon, because the sun's ecliptic limits are greater than the moon's; yet we have more visible eclipses of the moon than of the sun, because eclipses of the moon are seen from all parts of that hemisphere of the earth which is next her, and are equally great to each of those parts; but the sun's eclipses are visible only to that small portion of the hemisphere next him whereon the moon's shadow falls.\n\nThe moon's orbit being elliptical, and the earth in one of its focuses, she is once at her least distance from the earth, and once at her greatest, in every lunation. When the moon changes at her least distance from the earth, and so near the node that her dark shadow falls upon the earth, she appears big enough to cover the whole disk of the sun from that part on which her shadow falls; and the sun appears totally eclipsed there for some minutes: but when the moon changes at her greatest distance from the earth, and so near the node that her dark shadow is directed towards the earth, her diameter subtends a less angle than the sun's; and therefore she cannot hide his whole disk from any part of the earth, nor does her shadow reach it at that time; and to the place over which the point of her shadow hangs, the eclipse is annular, the sun's edge appearing like a luminous ring all around the body of the moon. When the change happens within 17 degrees of the node, and the moon at her mean distance from the earth, the point of her shadow just touches the earth, and she eclipseth the sun totally to that small spot whereon her shadow falls; but the darkness is not of a moment's continuance.\n\nThe moon's apparent diameter, when largest, exceeds the sun's, when least, only 1 minute 38 seconds of a degree; and in the greatest eclipse of the sun that can happen at any time and place, the total darkness continues no longer than whilst the moon is going 1 minute 38 seconds from the sun in her orbit, which is about 3 minutes and 13 seconds of an hour.\n\nThe moon's dark shadow covers only a spot on the earth's surface, about 180 English miles broad, when the moon's diameter appears largest, and the sun's least; and the total darkness can extend no farther than the dark shadow covers. Yet the moon's partial shadow or penumbra may then cover a circular space 4900 miles in diameter, within all which the sun is more or less eclipsed, as the places are less or more distant from the centre of the penumbra. When the moon changes exactly in the node, the penumbra is circular on the earth at the middle of the general eclipse; because at that time it falls perpendicularly on the earth's surface; but at every other moment it falls obliquely, and will therefore be elliptical; and the more so, as the time is longer before or after the middle of the general eclipse; and then, much greater portions of the earth's surface are involved in the penumbra.\n\nWhen the penumbra first touches the earth, the general eclipse begins; when it leaves the earth, the general eclipse ends: from the beginning to the end the sun appears eclipsed in some part of the earth or other. When the penumbra touches any place, the eclipse begins at that place, and ends when the penumbra leaves it. When the moon changes in the node, the penumbra goes...\ngoes over the centre of the earth's disk as seen from the moon; and consequently, by describing the longest line possible on the earth, continues the longest upon it; namely, at a mean rate, 5 hours 50 minutes; more, if the moon be at her greatest distance from the earth, because she then moves slower; less, if she be at her least distance, because of her quicker motion.\n\nTo make several of the above and other phenomena plainer, (Plate XLVI. fig. 3.), let S be the sun, E the earth, M the moon, and AMP the moon's orbit. Draw the right line Wc 12 from the western side of the sun at W, touching the western side of the moon at c, and the earth at 12; draw also the right line Vd 12 from the eastern side of the sun at V, touching the eastern side of the moon at d, and the earth at 12: the dark space included between those lines is the moon's shadow, ending in a point at 12, where it touches the earth; because in this case the moon is supposed to change at M in the middle between A the apogee, or farthest point of her orbit from the earth, and P the perigee, or nearest point to it. For, had the point P been at M, the moon had been nearer the earth; and her dark shadow at e would have covered a space upon it about 180 miles broad, and the sun would have been totally darkened, with some continuance; but had the point A been at M, the moon would have been farther from the earth, and her shadow would have ended in a point about e, and therefore the sun would have appeared like a luminous ring all around the moon. Draw the right lines WXdb and VXcg, touching the contrary sides of the sun and moon, and ending on the earth at a and b; draw also the right line SXM12, from the centre of the sun's disk, through the moon's centre, to the earth at 12; and suppose the two former lines WXdb and VXcg to revolve on the line SXM12 as an axis, and their points a and b will describe the limits of the penumbra TT' on the earth's surface, including the large space aob12a; within which the sun appears more or less eclipsed, as the places are more or less distant from the verge of the penumbra aob.\n\nDraw the right line y12 across the sun's disk, perpendicular to SXM the axis of the penumbra: then divide the line y12 into twelve equal parts, as in the figure, for the twelve digits or equal parts of the sun's diameter; and, at equal distances from the centre of the penumbra at 12 (on the earth's surface TT') to its edge aob, draw twelve concentric circles, as marked with the numeral figures 1 2 3 4 &c., and remember that the moon's motion in her orbit AMP is from west to east, as from s to t. Then,\n\nTo an observer on the earth at b, the eastern limb of the moon at d seems to touch the western limb of the sun at W', when the moon is at M; and the sun's eclipse begins at b, appearing as at A in Plate XLVII. fig. 1, at the left hand; but, at the same moment of absolute time to an observer at a in Plate XLVI. fig. 3, the western edge of the moon at c leaves the eastern edge of the sun at V', and the eclipse ends, as at the right hand C, Plate XLVII. fig. 1. At the very same instant, to all those who live on the circle marked 1 on the earth E, in Plate XLVI. fig. 3, the moon M cuts off or darkens a twelfth part of the sun S, and eclipses him one digit, as at 1 in Plate XLVII. fig. 1.: to those who live on the circle marked 2 in Plate XLVI. fig. 3, the moon cuts off two twelfths parts of the sun, as at 2 in Plate XLVII. fig. 1.; to those on the circle 3, three parts; and so on to the centre at 12 in Plate XLVI. fig. 3, where the sun is centrally eclipsed, as at B in the middle of fig. 1. Plate XLVII.; under which figure there is a scale of hours and minutes, to show at a mean rate how long it is from the beginning to the end of a central eclipse of the sun on the parallel of London; and how many digits are eclipsed at any particular time from the beginning at A to the middle at B, or the end at C. Thus, in 16 minutes from the beginning, the sun is two digits eclipsed; in an hour and five minutes, eight digits; and in an hour and 37 minutes, 12 digits.\n\nBy Plate XLVI. fig. 3, it is plain, that the sun is totally or centrally eclipsed but to a small part of the earth at any time; because the dark conical shadow e of the moon M falls but on a small part of the earth; and that the partial eclipse is confined at that time to the space included by the circle aob, of which only one half can be projected in the figure, the other half being supposed to be hid by the convexity of the earth E: and likewise, that no part of the sun is eclipsed to the large space YY' of the earth, because the moon is not between the sun and any of that part of the earth; and therefore to all that part the eclipse is invisible. The earth turns eastward on its axis, as from g to h, which is the same way that the moon's shadow moves; but the moon's motion is much swifter in her orbit from s to t: and therefore, although eclipses of the sun are of longer duration on account of the earth's motion on its axis than they would be if that motion was stopt, yet, in four minutes of time at most, the moon's swifter motion carries her dark shadow quite over any place that its centre touches at the time of greatest obscuration. The motion of the shadow on the earth's disk is equal to the moon's motion from the sun, which is about 30\u00bd minutes of a degree every hour at a mean rate; but so much of the moon's orbit is equal to 30\u00bd degrees of a great circle on the earth; and therefore the moon's shadow goes 30\u00bd degrees, or 1820 geographical miles on the earth in an hour, or 30\u00bd miles in a minute, which is almost four times as swift as the motion of a cannon-ball.\n\nAs seen from the sun or moon, the earth's axis appears differently inclined every day of the year, on account of keeping its parallelism throughout its annual course. In Plate XLVII. fig. 2, let EDON be the earth at the two equinoxes and the two solstices, NS its axis, N the north pole, S the south pole, AEQ the equator, T the tropic of Cancer, t the tropic of Capricorn, and ABC the circumference of the earth's enlightened disk as seen from the sun or new moon at these times. The earth's axis has the position NES at the vernal equinox, lying towards the right hand, as seen from the sun or new moon; its poles N and S being then in the circumference of the disk; and the equator and all its parallels seem to be straight lines, because their planes pass through the observer's eye looking down upon the earth from the sun or moon directly over E; where the ecliptic FG intersects the equator AE. At the summer solstice, the earth's axis has the position NDS.\nand that part of the ecliptic FG, in which the moon is then new, touches the tropic of Cancer T at D. The north pole N at that time, inclining 23\u00bd degrees towards the sun, falls so many degrees within the earth's enlightened disk, because the sun is then vertical to D, 23\u00bd degrees north of the equator AQ; and the equator with all its parallels seem elliptic curves bending downward, or towards the south pole, as seen from the sun; which pole, together with 23\u00bd degrees all round it, is hid behind the disk in the dark hemisphere of the earth. At the autumnal equinox, the earth's axis has the position NOS, lying to the left hand as seen from the sun or new moon, which are then vertical to O, where the ecliptic cuts the equator AQ. Both poles now lie in the circumference of the disk, the north pole just going to disappear behind it, and the south pole just entering into it; and the equator, with all its parallels, seem to be straight lines, because their planes pass through the observer's eye, as seen from the sun, and very nearly so as seen from the moon. At the winter solstice, the earth's axis has the position NVS; when its south pole S inclining 23\u00bd degrees toward the sun, falls 23\u00bd degrees within the enlightened disk, as seen from the sun or new moon, which are then vertical to the tropic of Capricorn t, 23\u00bd degrees south of the equator AQ; and the equator, with all its parallels, seem elliptic curves bending upward; the north pole being as far hid behind the disk in the dark hemisphere, as the south pole is come into the light. The nearer that any time of the year is to the equinoxes or solstices, the more it partakes of the phenomena relating to them.\n\nThus it appears, that from the vernal equinox to the autumnal, the north pole is enlightened; and the equator, and all its parallels, appear elliptical as seen from the sun, more or less curved as the time is nearer to, or farther from, the summer solstice; and bending downwards, or towards the south pole; the reverse of which happens from the autumnal equinox to the vernal. A little consideration will be sufficient to convince the reader, that the earth's axis inclines towards the sun at the summer solstice; from the sun at the winter solstice; and sidewise to the sun at the equinoxes; but towards the right hand, as seen from the sun at the vernal equinox; and towards the left hand at the autumnal. From the winter to the summer solstice, the earth's axis inclines more or less to the right hand, as seen from the sun; and the contrary from the summer to the winter solstice.\n\nThe different positions of the earth's axis, as seen from the sun at different times of the year, affect solar eclipses greatly with regard to particular places; yea, so far as would make central eclipses which fall at one time of the year invisible if they fell at another, even though the moon should always change in the nodes, and at the same hour of the day; of which indefinitely various affections, we shall only give examples for the times of the equinoxes and solstices.\n\nIn the same diagram, (Plate XLVII., fig. 2.), let FG be part of the ecliptic, and IK, ik, ik, ik, part of the moon's orbit; both seen edgewise, and therefore projected into right lines; and let the intersections NODE be one and the same node at the above times, when the earth has the forementioned different positions; and let the spaces included by the circles Pppp be the penumbra at these times, as its centre is passing over the centre of the earth's disk. At the winter solstice, when the earth's axis has the position NNS, the centre of the penumbra P touches the tropic of Capricorn t in N at the middle of the general eclipse; but no part of the penumbra touches the tropic of Cancer T. At the summer solstice, when the earth's axis has the position NDS (iDk being then part of the moon's orbit, whose node is at D) the penumbra p has its centre at D, on the tropic of Cancer T, at the middle of the general eclipse, and then no part of it touches the tropic of Capricorn t. At the autumnal equinox, the earth's axis has the position NOS, (iDk being then part of the moon's orbit), and the penumbra equally includes part of both tropics T and t at the middle of the general eclipse: at the vernal equinox it does the same, because the earth's axis has the position NES; but, in the former of these two last cases, the penumbra enters the earth at A, north of the tropic of Cancer T, and leaves it at m, south of the tropic of Capricorn t; having gone over the earth obliquely southward, as its centre described the line Aom; whereas, in the latter case, the penumbra touches the earth at n, south of the equator AQ, and describing the line nEq, (similar to the former line Aom in open space), goes obliquely northward over the earth, and leaves it at q, north of the equator.\n\nIn all these circumstances, the moon has been supposed to change at noon in her descending node: Had she changed in her ascending node, the phenomena would have been as various the contrary way, with respect to the penumbra's going northward or southward over the earth. But because the moon changes at all hours, as often in one node as in the other, and at all distances from them both at different times as it happens, the variety of the phases of eclipses are almost innumerable, even at the same places; considering also how variously the same places are situated on the enlightened disk of the earth, with respect to the penumbra's motion, at the different hours when eclipses happen.\n\nWhen the moon changes 17 degrees short of her descending node, the penumbra P 18 just touches the northern part of the earth's disk, near the north pole N; and, as seen from that place, the moon appears to touch the sun, but hides no part of him from sight. Had the change been as far short of the ascending node, the penumbra would have touched the southern part of the disk near the south pole S. When the moon changes 12 degrees short of the descending node, more than a third part of the penumbra P 12 falls on the northern parts of the earth at the middle of the general eclipse: Had the change been as far past the same node, as much of the other side of the penumbra about P would have fallen on the southern part of the earth; all the rest in the expansion, or open space. When the moon changes 6 degrees from the node, almost the whole penumbra P 6 falls on the earth at the middle of the general eclipse. And lastly, when the moon changes in the node at N, the penumbra PN takes the longest course possible on the earth's disk; its centre\ncentre falling on the middle thereof, at the middle of the general eclipse. The farther the moon changes from either node, within 17 degrees of it, the shorter is the penumbra's continuance on the earth, because it goes over a less portion of the disk, as is evident by the figure.\n\nThe nearer that the penumbra's centre is to the equator at the middle of the general eclipse, the longer is the duration of the eclipse at all those places where it is central; because, the nearer that any place is to the equator, the greater is the circle it describes by the earth's motion on its axis: And so, the place moving quicker, keeps longer in the penumbra, whose motion is the same way with that of the place, though faster, as has been already mentioned. Thus (see the earth at D and the penumbra at 12) whilst the point b in the polar circle abcd is carried from b to c by the earth's diurnal motion, the point d on the tropic of Cancer T is carried a much greater length from d to D; and therefore, if the penumbra's centre goes one time over c and another time over D, the penumbra will be longer in passing over the moving place d than it was in passing over the moving place b. Consequently, central eclipses about the poles are of the shortest duration; and about the equator of the longest.\n\nIn the middle of summer, the whole frigid zone, included by the polar circle abcd, is enlightened; and if it then happens, that the penumbra's centre goes over the north pole, the sun will be eclipsed much the same number of digits at a as at c; but whilst the penumbra moves eastward over c, it moves westward over a; because, with respect to the penumbra, the motions of a and c are contrary: For c moves the same way with the penumbra towards d, but a moves the contrary way towards b; and therefore the eclipse will be of longer duration at c than at a. At a the eclipse begins on the sun's eastern limb, but at c on its western: At all places lying without the polar circles, the sun's eclipses begin on his western limb, or near it, and end on or near his eastern. At those places where the penumbra touches the earth, the eclipse begins with the rising sun, on the top of his western or uppermost edge; and at those places where the penumbra leaves the earth, the eclipse ends with the setting sun, on the top of his eastern edge, which is then the uppermost, just as its disappearing in the horizon.\n\nIf the moon were surrounded by an atmosphere of any considerable density, it would seem to touch the sun a little before the moon made her appulse to his edge, and we should see a little faintness on that edge before it were eclipsed by the moon: But as no such faintness has been observed, it seems plain, that the moon has no such atmosphere as that of the earth. The faint ring of light surrounding the sun in total eclipses, called by Callini la chevelure du soleil, seems to be the atmosphere of the sun; because it has been observed to move equally with the sun, not with the moon.\n\nHaving been so prolix concerning eclipses of the sun, we shall drop that subject at present, and proceed to the doctrine of lunar eclipses; which, being more simple, may be explained in less time.\n\nThat the moon can never be eclipsed but at the time of her being full, and the reason why she is not eclipsed at every full, has been shewn already. In Plate XLVI. fig. 3, let S be the sun, E the earth, RR the earth's shadow, and B the moon in opposition to the sun: In this situation the earth intercepts the sun's light in its way to the moon; and when the moon touches the earth's shadow at v, she begins to be eclipsed on her eastern limb x, and continues eclipsed until her western limb y leaves the shadow at w: At B she is in the middle of the shadow, and consequently in the middle of the eclipse.\n\nThe moon, when totally eclipsed, is not invisible if she be above the horizon and the sky be clear; but appears generally of a dusky colour, like tarnished copper, which some have thought to be the moon's native light. But the true cause of her being visible is the scattered beams of the sun, bent, into the earth's shadow by going through the atmosphere; which, being more or less dense near the earth than at considerable heights above it, refracts or bends the sun's rays more inward, the nearer they are passing by the earth's surface, than those rays which go through higher parts of the atmosphere, where it is less dense according to its height, until it be so thin or rare as to lose its refractive power. Let the circle fgbi, concentric to the earth, include the atmosphere whose refractive power vanishes at the heights f and i; so that the rays Wfaw and Vvgo go on straight without suffering the least refraction: But all those rays which enter the atmosphere between f and k, and between i and l, on opposite sides of the earth, are gradually more bent inward as they go through a greater portion of the atmosphere, until the rays Wk and Vl touching the earth at m and n, are bent so much as to meet at q, a little short of the moon; and therefore the dark shadow of the earth is contained in the space mognp, where none of the sun's rays can enter: All the rest RR, being mixed by the scattered rays which are refracted as above, is in some measure enlightened by them; and some of those rays falling on the moon, give her the colour of tarnished copper, or of iron almost red hot. So that if the earth had no atmosphere, the moon would be as invisible in total eclipses as she is when new. If the moon were so near the earth as to go into its dark shadow, suppose about po, she would be invisible during her stay in it; but visible before and after in the fainter shadow RR.\n\nWhen the moon goes through the centre of the earth's shadow, she is directly opposite to the sun: Yet the moon has been often seen totally eclipsed in the horizon when the sun was also visible in the opposite part of it: For, the horizontal refraction being almost 34 minutes of a degree, and the diameter of the sun and moon being each at a mean state but 32 minutes, the refraction causes both luminaries to appear above the horizon when they are really below it.\n\nWhen the moon is full at 12 degrees from either of her nodes, she just touches the earth's shadow, but enters not into it. In Plate XLVII. fig. 3, let GH be the ecliptic, ef the moon's orbit where she is 12 degrees from the node at her full; cd her orbit where she is 6 degrees from the node, ab her orbit where she is full in the node, AB the earth's shadow, and M the moon. When\nthe moon describes the line ef; she just touches the shadow, but does not enter into it; when she describes the line cd, she is totally, though not centrally, immersed in the shadow; and when she describes the line ab, she passes by the node at M in the centre of the shadow, and takes the longest line possible, which is a diameter, thro' it: And such an eclipse being both total and central is of the longest duration, namely, 3 hours 57 minutes 6 seconds from the beginning to the end, if the moon be at her greatest distance from the earth; and 3 hours 37 minutes 26 seconds, if she be at her least distance. The reason of this difference is, that when the moon is farthest from the earth, she moves slowest; and when nearest to it, quickest.\n\nThe moon's diameter, as well as the sun's, is supposed to be divided into twelve equal parts, called digits; and so many of these parts as are darkened by the earth's shadow, so many digits is the moon eclipsed. All that the moon is eclipsed above 12 digits, shew how far the shadow of the earth is over the body of the moon, on that edge to which she is nearest at the middle of the eclipse.\n\nIt is difficult to observe exactly either the beginning or ending of a lunar eclipse, even with a good telescope; because the earth's shadow is so faint and ill defined about the edges, that when the moon is either just touching or leaving it, the obscuration of her limb is scarcely sensible; and therefore the nicest observers can hardly be certain to four or five seconds of time. But both the beginning and ending of solar eclipses are visibly instantaneous; for the moment that the edge of the moon's disk touches the sun's, his roundness seems a little broke on that part; and the moment she leaves it, he appears perfectly round again.\n\nIn astronomy, eclipses of the moon are of great use for ascertaining the periods of her motions; especially such eclipses as are observed to be alike in all her circumstances, and have long intervals of time between them. In geography, the longitudes of places are found by eclipses: But for this purpose eclipses of the moon are more useful than those of the sun, because they are more frequently visible, and the same lunar eclipse is of equal largeness and duration at all places where it is seen. In chronology, both solar and lunar eclipses serve to determine exactly the time of any past event: for there are so many particulars observable in every eclipse, with respect to its quantity, the places where it is visible (if of the sun) and the time of the day or night, that it is impossible there can be two solar eclipses in the course of many ages which are alike in all circumstances.\n\nFrom the above explanation of the doctrine of eclipses it is evident, that the darkness at our Saviour's crucifixion was supernatural. For he suffered on the day on which the passover was eaten by the Jews, on which day it was impossible that the moon's shadow could fall on the earth; for the Jews kept the passover at the time of full moon: Nor does the darkness in total eclipses of the sun last above four minutes in any place; whereas the darkness at the crucifixion lasted three hours, Matth. xxviii. 15. and overspread at least all the land of Judaea.\n\nWith regard to the method of calculating and projecting eclipses, we must refer the reader to the astronomical tables of Mr Fergufon and others. When the principles are explained, the application and use of the tables is a matter of small difficulty, and easily acquired by a little practice.\n\nChap. XVII. Of the fixed Stars.\n\nThe stars are said to be fixed, because they have been generally observed to keep at the same distances from each other: their apparent diurnal revolutions being caused solely by the earth's turning on its axis. They appear of a sensible magnitude to the bare eye, because the retina is affected not only by the rays of light which are emitted directly from them, but by many thousands more, which, falling upon our eye-lids, and upon the aerial particles about us, are reflected into our eyes so strongly as to excite vibrations not only in those points of the retina where the real images of the stars are formed, but also in other points at some distance round about. This makes us imagine the stars to be much bigger than they would appear, if we saw them only by the few rays which come directly from them, so as to enter our eyes without being intermixed with others. Any one may be sensible of this, by looking at a star of the first magnitude through a long narrow tube; which, though it takes in as much of the sky as would hold a thousand such stars, yet scarce renders that one visible.\n\nThe more a telescope magnifies, the less is the aperture through which the star is seen; and consequently the fewer rays it admits into the eye. Now since the stars appear less in a telescope which magnifies 200 times, than they do to the bare eye, infomuch that they seem to be only indivisible points, it proves at once that the stars are at immense distances from us, and that they shine by their own proper light. If they shone by borrowed light, they would be as invisible without telescopes as the satellites of Jupiter are; for these satellites appear bigger when viewed with a good telescope than the largest fixed stars do.\n\nThe number of stars discoverable, in either hemisphere, by the naked eye, is not above a thousand. This at first may appear incredible; because they seem to be without number: But the deception arises from our looking confusedly upon them, without reducing them into order. For, look but steadfastly upon a pretty large portion of the sky, and count the number of stars in it, and you will be surprised to find them so few. Or, if one considers how seldom the moon meets with any stars in her way, although there are as many about her path as in other parts of the heavens, he will soon be convinced that the stars are much thinner down than he was aware of. The British catalogue, which, besides the stars visible to the bare eye, includes a great number which cannot be seen without the assistance of a telescope, contains no more than three thousand, in both hemispheres.\n\nAs we have incomparably more light from the moon than from all the stars together, it were the greatest absurdity\nIt is not easy to imagine that the stars were made for no other purpose than to cast a faint light upon the earth; especially since many more require the assistance of a good telescope to find them out, than are visible without that instrument. Our sun is surrounded by a system of planets and comets; all which would be invisible from the nearest fixed star. And from what we already know of the immense distance of the stars, the nearest may be computed at $32,000,000,000,000$ miles from us, which is farther than a cannon-bullet would fly in $7,000,000$ years. Hence it is easy to prove, that the sun, seen from such a distance, would appear no bigger than a star of the first magnitude. From all this it is highly probable, that each star is a sun to a system of worlds moving round it, though unseen by us; especially as the doctrine of a plurality of worlds is rational, and greatly manifests the power, wisdom, and goodness of the great Creator.\n\nThe stars, on account of their apparently various magnitudes, have been distributed into several classes, or orders. Those which appear largest, are called stars of the first magnitude; the next to them in lustre, stars of the second magnitude; and so on the sixth, which are the smallest that are visible to the bare eye. This distribution having been made long before the invention of telescopes, the stars which cannot be seen without the assistance of these instruments, are distinguished by the name of telescopic stars.\n\nThe ancients divided the starry sphere into particular constellations, or systems of stars, according as they lay near one another, so as to occupy those spaces which the figures of different sorts of animals or things would take up, if they were there delineated. And those stars which could not be brought into any particular constellation, were called unformed stars.\n\nThis division of the stars into different constellations or asterisms, serves to distinguish them from one another, so that any particular star may be readily found in the heavens by means of a celestial globe; on which the constellations are so delineated, as to put the most remarkable stars into such parts of the figures as are most easily distinguished. The number of the ancient constellations is 48, and upon our present globes about 70. On Sevex's globes are inserted Bayer's letters; the first in the Greek alphabet being put to the biggest star in each constellation, the second to the next, and so on. By which means, every star is as easily found as if a name were given to it. Thus, if the star \u03b3 in the constellation of the ram be mentioned, every astronomer knows as well what star is meant as if it were pointed out to him in the heavens.\n\nThere is also a division of the heavens into three parts.\n\n1. The Zodiak (\u0396\u03c9\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2) from \u03b6\u03c9\u03b4\u03af\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd, zodiac, an animal, because most of the constellations in it, which are twelve in number, are the figures of animals: As Aries the ram, Taurus the bull, Gemini the twins, Cancer the crab, Leo the lion, Virgo the virgin, Libra the balance, Scorpio the scorpion, Sagittarius the archer, Capricornus the goat, Aquarius the water-bearer, and Pisces the fishes. The zodiac goes quite round the heavens: it is about 16 degrees broad, so that it takes in the orbits of all the planets, and likewise the orbit of the moon. Along the middle of this zone or belt is the ecliptic, or circle which the earth describes annually as seen from the sun; and which the sun appears to describe as seen from the earth.\n\n2. All that region of the heavens, which is on the north side of the zodiac, containing twenty-one constellations. And, 3. That on the south side, containing fifteen.\n\nThe ancients divided the zodiac into the above twelve constellations or signs in the following manner. They took a vessel with a small hole in the bottom, and having filled it with water, suffered the same to distil drop by drop into another vessel set beneath to receive it; beginning at the moment when some star rose, and continuing until it rose the next following night. The water fallen down into the receiver they divided into twelve equal parts; and having two other small vessels in readiness, each of them fit to contain one part, they again poured all the water into the upper vessel, and observing the rising of some star in the zodiac, they at the same time suffered the water to drop into one of the small vessels; and as soon as it was full, they shifted it, and set an empty one in its place. When each vessel was full, they took notice what star of the zodiac rose; and though this could not be done in one night, yet in many they observed the rising of twelve stars or points, by which they divided the zodiac into twelve parts.\n\nThe names of the constellations, and the number of stars observed in each of them by different astronomers, are as follow.\n\n| Constellation          |

Stars.\n\n| Constellation       | Hevel. | Flamst. |\n|---------------------|--------|---------|\n| Lynx                | 19     | 44      |\n| Leo minor           | 53     |         |\n\nThere is a remarkable track round the heavens, called the Milky Way, from its peculiar whiteness, which was formerly thought to be owing to a vast number of very small stars therein; but the telescope shews it to be quite otherwise; and therefore its whiteness must be owing to some other cause. This track appears single in some parts, in others double.\n\nThere are several little whitish spots in the heavens, which appear magnified, and more luminous when seen through telescopes; yet without any stars in them. One of these is in Andromeda's girdle, and was first observed A.D. 1612, by Simon Marius; it has some whitish rays.\n\nrays near its middle, is liable to several changes, and is sometimes invisible. Another is near the ecliptic; between the head and bow of Sagittarius: it is small, but very luminous. A third is on the back of the Centaur, which is too far south to be seen in Britain. A fourth, of a smaller size, is before Antinous's right foot; having a star in it, which makes it appear more bright. A fifth is in the constellation of Hercules, between the stars \u03b6 and \u03b7, which spot, though but small, is visible to the bare eye, if the sky be clear and the moon absent.\n\nCloudy stars are so called from their misty appearance. They look like dim stars to the naked eye; but through a telescope they appear broad illuminated parts of the sky; in some of which is one star, in others more. Five of these are mentioned by Ptolemy. 1. One at the extremity of the right hand of Perseus. 2. One in the middle of the Crab. 3. One unformed, near the sting of the Scorpion. 4. The eye of Sagittarius. 5. One in the head of Orion. In the first of these appear more stars through the telescope than in any of the rest, although 21 have been counted in the head of Orion, and above 40 in that of the Crab. Two are visible in the eye of Sagittarius without a telescope, and several more with it. Flamsteed observed a cloudy star in the bow of Sagittarius, containing many small stars; and the star above Sagittarius's right shoulder is encompassed with several more. Both Cassini and Flamsteed discovered one between the Great and Little Dog, which is very full of stars visible only by the telescope. The two whitish spots near the south pole, called the Magellanic Clouds by sailors, which to the bare eye resemble part of the Milky Way, appear through telescopes to be a mixture of small clouds and stars. But the most remarkable of all the cloudy stars is that in the middle of Orion's Sword, where seven stars (of which three are very close together) seem to shine through a cloud, very lucid near the middle, but faint and ill defined about the edges. It looks like a gap in the sky, through which one may see (as it were) part of a much brighter region. Although most of these spaces are but a few minutes of a degree in breadth, yet, since they are among the fixed stars, they must be spaces larger than what is occupied by our solar system; and in which there seems to be a perpetual uninterrupted day among numberless worlds, which no human art ever can discover.\n\nSeveral stars are mentioned by ancient astronomers, which are not now to be found; and others are now visible to the bare eye which are not recorded in the ancient catalogues. Hipparchus observed a new star about 170 years before Christ; but he has not mentioned in what part of the heaven it was seen, although it occasioned his making a catalogue of the stars; which is the most ancient that we have.\n\nThe first new star that we have any good account of, was discovered by Cornelius Gemma on the 8th of November A.D. 1572, in the chair of Cassiopea. It surpassed Sirius in brightness and magnitude; and was seen for 16 months successively. At first it appeared bigger than Jupiter to some eyes, by which it was seen at midday; afterwards it decayed gradually both in magnitude and lustre, until March 1573, when it became invisible.\n\nOn the 13th of August 1596, David Fabricius observed the Stella Mira, or wonderful star, in the neck of the Whale; which has been since found to appear and disappear periodically, seven times in six years, continuing in the greatest lustre for 15 days together; and is never quite extinguished.\n\nIn the year 1600, William Janssenius discovered a changeable star in the neck of the Swan; which, in time, became so small as to be thought to disappear entirely, till the years 1657, 1658, and 1659, when it recovered its former lustre and magnitude; but soon decayed, and is now of the smallest size.\n\nIn the year 1604 Kepler and several of his friends saw a new star near the heel of the right foot of Serpentarius, so bright and sparkling, that it exceeded anything they had ever seen before; and took notice that it was every moment changing into some of the colours of the rainbow, except when it was near the horizon, at which time it was generally white. It surpassed Jupiter in magnitude, which was near it all the month of October, but easily distinguished from Jupiter, by the steady light of Jupiter. It disappeared between October 1605 and the February following, and has not been seen since that time.\n\nIn the year 1670, July 15, Hevelius discovered a new star, which in October was so decayed as to be scarcely perceptible. In April following it regained its lustre, but wholly disappeared in August. In March 1672 it was seen again, but very small; and has not been visible since.\n\nIn the year 1686 a new star was discovered by Kirch, which returns periodically in 404 days.\n\nIn the year 1672, Cassini saw a star in the neck of the Bull, which he thought was not visible in Tycho's time, nor when Bayer made his figures.\n\nMany stars, besides those above mentioned, have been observed to change their magnitudes: and as none of them could ever be perceived to have tails, it is plain they could not be comets; especially as they had no parallax, even when largest and brightest. It would seem, that the periodical stars have vast clusters of dark spots, and very slow rotations on their axes; by which means, they must disappear when the side covered with spots is turned towards us. And as for those which break out all of a sudden with such lustre, it is by no means improbable that they are suns whose fuel is almost spent, and again supplied by some of their comets falling upon them, and occasioning an uncommon blaze and splendor for some time; which indeed appears to be the greatest use of the cometary part of any system.\n\n* M. Maupertuis, in his dissertation on the figures of the celestial bodies, (p. 61\u201463.), is of opinion that some stars, by their prodigious quick rotations on their axes, may not only assume the figures of oblate spheroids, but that, by the great centrifugal force arising from such rotations, they may become of the figures of mill-stones; or\nSome of the stars, particularly Arcturus, have been observed to change their places above a minute of a degree with respect to others. But whether this be owing to any real motion in the stars themselves, must require the observations of many ages to determine. If our solar system changeth its place, with regard to absolute space, this must in process of time occasion an apparent change in the distances of the stars from each other; and in such a case, the places of the nearest stars to us being more affected than those which are very remote, their relative positions must seem to alter, though the stars themselves were really immoveable. On the other hand, if our own system be at rest, and any of the stars in real motion, this must vary their positions; and the more so, the nearer they are to us, or swifter their motions are, or the more proper the direction of their motion is for our perception.\n\nThe obliquity of the ecliptic to the equinoctial is found at present to be above the third part of a degree less than Ptolemy found it. And most of the observers after him found it to decrease gradually down to Tycho\u2019s time. If it be objected, that we cannot depend on the observations of the ancients, because of the incorrectness of their instruments; we have to answer, that both Tycho and Flamsteed are allowed to have been very good observers; and yet we find that Flamsteed makes this obliquity 2\u00bd minutes of a degree less than Tycho did about 100 years before him: and as Ptolemy was 1324 years before Tycho, so the gradual decrease answers nearly to the difference of time between these three astronomers. If we consider, that the earth is not a perfect sphere, but an oblate spheroid, having its axis shorter than its equatorial diameter; and that the sun and moon are constantly acting obliquely upon the greater quantity of matter about the equator, pulling it, as it were, towards a nearer and nearer coincidence with the ecliptic; it will not appear improbable that these actions should gradually diminish the angle between those planes. Nor is it less probable that the mutual attractions of all the planets should have a tendency to bring their orbits to a coincidence: but this change is too small to become sensible in many ages.\n\n**Chap. XVIII. Of the Division of Time.**\n\nA perpetual Table of New Moons. The Times of the Birth and Death of Christ. A Table of remarkable Eras or Events.\n\nThe parts of time are Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days, Years, Cycles, Ages, and Periods.\n\nThe original standard, or integral measure of time, is a year; which is determined by the revolution of some celestial body in its orbit, viz. the sun or moon.\n\nThe time measured by the sun\u2019s revolution in the ecliptic, from any equinox or solstice to the same again, is called the Solar or Tropical Year, which contains 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 57 seconds; and is the only proper or natural year, because it always keeps the same seasons to the same months.\n\nThe quantity of time measured by the sun\u2019s revolution, as from any fixed star to the same star again, is called the Sidereal year; which contains 365 days 6 hours 9 minutes 14\u00bd seconds; and is 20 minutes 17\u00bd seconds longer than the true solar year.\n\nThe time measured by twelve revolutions of the moon, from the sun to the sun again, is called the Lunar year; it contains 354 days 8 hours 48 minutes 36 seconds; and is therefore 10 days 21 hours 0 minutes 21 seconds shorter than the solar year. This is the foundation of the epact.\n\nThe civil year is that which is in common use among the different nations of the world; of which, some reckon by the lunar, but most by the solar. The civil solar year contains 365 days, for three years running, which are called common years; and then comes in what is called the bissextile or leap-year, which contains 366 days. This is also called the Julian year, on account of Julius Caesar, who appointed the intercalary-day every fourth year, thinking thereby to make the civil and solar year keep pace together. And this day, being added to the 23d of February, which in the Roman calendar was the sixth of the kalends of March, that sixth day was twice reckoned, or the 23d and 24th were reckoned as one day, and was called bis sextus dies; and thence came the name bissextile for that year. But in our common almanacks this day is added at the end of February.\n\nThe civil lunar year is also common or intercalary. The common year consists of 12 lunations, which contain 354 days; at the end of which, the year begins again. The intercalary, or embolimic year is that wherein a month was added, to adjust the lunar year to the solar. This method was used by the Jews, who kept their account by the lunar motions. But by intercalating no more than a month of 30 days, which they called Ves-Adar, every third year, they fell 3\u00bd days short of the solar year in that time.\n\nThe Romans also used the lunar embolimic year at first, as it was settled by Romulus their first king, who made it to consist only of ten months or lunations, which fell 61 days short of the solar year, and so their year became quite vague and unfixed; for which reason, they were forced to have a table published by the high-priest, to inform them when the spring and other seasons began.\n\nor be reduced to flat circular planes, so thin as to be quite invisible when their edges are turned towards us; as Saturn\u2019s ring is in such positions. But when very eccentric planets or comets go round any flat star, in orbits much inclined to its equator, the attraction of the planets or comets in their perihelions must alter the inclination of the axis of that star; on which account it will appear more or less large and luminous, as its broad side is more or less turned towards us. And thus he imagines we may account for the apparent changes of magnitude and lustre in those stars; and likewise for their appearing and disappearing.\nBut Julius C\u00e6sar, as already mentioned, taking this troublesome affair into consideration, reformed the calendar, by making the year to consist of 365 days 6 hours.\n\nThe year thus settled, is what we still make use of in Britain; but as it is somewhat more than 11 minutes longer than the solar tropical year, the times of the equinoxes go backward, and fall earlier by one day in about 130 years. In the time of the Nicene Council, (A.D. 325), which was 1444 years ago, the vernal equinox fell on the 21st of March; and if we divide 1444 by 130, it will quote 11, which is the number of days which the equinox has fallen back since the Council of Nice. This causing great disturbances, by unfixing the times of the celebration of Easter, and consequently of all the other moveable feasts, Pope Gregory XIIIth, in the year 1582, ordered ten days to be at once struck out of that year; and the next day after the 4th of October was called the 15th. By this means the vernal equinox was restored to the 21st of March; and it was endeavoured, by the omission of three intercalary days in 400 years, to make the civil or political year keep pace with the solar for time to come. This new form of the year is called the Gregorian account, or new style; which is received in all countries where the pope's authority is acknowledged, and ought to be in all places where truth is regarded.\n\nThe principal division of the year is into months, which are of two sorts, namely, astronomical and civil. The astronomical month is the time in which the moon runs through the zodiac, and is either periodical or synodical. The periodical month is the time spent by the moon in making one complete revolution from any point of the zodiac to the same again; which is $27^d\\ 7^h\\ 43^m$. The synodical month, called a lunation, is the time contained between the moon's parting with the sun at a conjunction, and returning to him again, which is $29^d\\ 12^h\\ 44^m$.\n\nThe civil months are those which are framed for the uses of civil life; and are different as to their names, number of days, and times of beginning, in several different countries. The first month of the Jewish year fell according to the moon in our August and September, old style; the second in September and October; and so on. The first month of the Egyptian year began on the 29th of our August. The first month of the Arabic and Turkish year began the 16th of July. The first month of the Grecian year fell according to the moon in June and July, the second in July and August, and so on, as in the following table.\n\nA month is divided into four parts called weeks, and a week into seven parts called days; so that in a Julian year there are 13 such months, or 52 weeks, and one day over. The Gentiles gave the names of the sun, moon, and planets, to the days of the week. To the first, the name of the Sun; to the second, of the Moon; to the third, of Mars; to the fourth, of Mercury; to the fifth, of Jupiter; to the sixth, of Venus; and to the seventh, of Saturn.\n\n| No | The Jewish year | Days |\n|----|----------------|------|\n| 1  | Tifri          | Aug.\u2014Sept. 30 |\n| 2  | Marchesvan     | Sept.\u2014Oct. 29 |\n| 3  | Casleu         | Oct.\u2014Nov. 30 |\n| 4  | Tebeth         | Nov.\u2014Dec. 29 |\n| 5  | Shebat         | Dec.\u2014Jan. 30 |\n| 6  | Adar           | Jan.\u2014Feb. 29 |\n| 7  | Nisan or Abib  | Feb.\u2014Mar. 30 |\n| 8  | Jiar           | Mar.\u2014Apr. 29 |\n| 9  | Sivan          | Apr.\u2014May 30 |\n| 10 | Tamuz          | May\u2014June 29 |\n| 11 | Ab             | June\u2014July 30 |\n| 12 | Elul           | July\u2014Aug. 29 |\n\nDays in the year 354\n\nIn the embolimic year after Adar they added a month called Ve-Adar of 30 days.\n\n| No | The Egyptian year | Days |\n|----|------------------|------|\n| 1  | Thoth            | August 29 30 |\n| 2  | Paophi           | Septemb. 28 30 |\n| 3  | Athir            | October 28 30 |\n| 4  | Chojac           | Novemb. 27 30 |\n| 5  | Tybi             | Decemb. 27 30 |\n| 6  | Mechir           | January 26 30 |\n| 7  | Phamenoth        | February 25 30 |\n| 8  | Parmuthi         | March 27 30 |\n| 9  | Pachon           | April 26 30 |\n| 10 | Payni            | May 26 30 |\n| 11 | Epiphi           | June 25 30 |\n| 12 | Mefori           | July 25 30 |\n\nEpagomen\u00e6 or days added 5\n\nDays in the year 365\n| No | The Arabic and Turkish year | Days | No | The ancient Grecian year | Days |\n|----|---------------------------|------|----|--------------------------|------|\n| 1  | Muharram                  | July | 16 | 30                       | 1    | Hecatombaon          | June | July | 30 |\n| 2  | Safar                     | August | 15 | 29                      | 2    | Metagintion         | July | Aug. | 29 |\n| 3  | Rabia I                   | Septemb. | 13 | 30                      | 3    | Boedromion         | Aug. | Sept. | 30 |\n| 4  | Rabia II                  | October | 13 | 29                      | 4    | Pyanepstion        | S:pt. | Oct. | 29 |\n| 5  | Jomada I                  | Novemb. | 11 | 30                      | 5    | Maimacterion       | Oct. | Nov. | 30 |\n| 6  | Jomada II                 | Decemb. | 11 | 29                      | 6    | Poideon            | Nov. | Dec. | 29 |\n| 7  | Rajab                     | January | 9  | 30                      | 7    | Gamelion           | Dec. | Jan. | 30 |\n| 8  | Shafban                   | February | 8  | 29                      | 8    | Anthesterion       | Jan. | Feb. | 29 |\n| 9  | Ramadam                   | March | 9  | 30                      | 9    | Elaphebolion       | Feb. | Mar. | 30 |\n| 10 | Shawal                    | April | 8  | 29                      | 10   | Munichion          | Mar. | Apr. | 29 |\n| 11 | Dulhaadah                 | May   | 7  | 30                      | 11   | Thargelion         | Apr. | May. | 30 |\n| 12 | Dulheggia                 | June  | 5  | 29                      | 12   | Schirrophorion     | May  | June | 29 |\n\nDays in the year 354\n\nThe Arabians add 11 days at the end of every year, which keep the same months to the same seasons.\n\nA day is either natural or artificial. The natural day contains 24 hours; the artificial the time from sunrise to sun-set. The natural day is either astronomical or civil. The astronomical day begins at noon, because the increase and decrease of days terminated by the horizon are very unequal among themselves; which inequality is likewise augmented by the inconstancy of the horizontal refractions, and therefore the astronomer takes the meridian for the limit of diurnal revolutions, reckoning noon, that is, the instant when the sun's centre is on the meridian, for the beginning of the day. The British, French, Dutch, Germans, Spaniards, Portuguese, and Egyptians, begin the civil day at midnight; the ancient Greeks, Jews, Bohemians, Silesians, with the modern Italians, and Chinese, begin it at sun-setting; and the ancient Babylonians, Persians, Syrians, with the modern Greeks, at sun-rising.\n\nAn hour is a certain determinate part of the day, and is either equal or unequal. An equal hour is the 24th part of a mean natural day, as shown by well-regulated clocks and watches; but these hours are not quite equal as measured by the returns of the sun to the meridian, because of the obliquity of the ecliptic and sun's unequal motion in it. Unequal hours are those by which the artificial day is divided into twelve parts, and the night into as many.\n\nAn hour is divided into 60 equal parts called minutes, a minute into 60 equal parts called seconds, and these again into 60 equal parts called thirds. The Jews, Chaldeans, and Arabians, divide the hour into 1080 equal parts called scruples; which number contains 18 times 60, so that one minute contains 18 scruples.\n\nA cycle is a perpetual round, or circulation of the same parts of time of any sort. The cycle of the sun is a revolution of 28 years, in which time the days of the months return again to the same days of the week; the sun's place to the same signs and degrees of the ecliptic on the same months and days, so as not to differ one degree in 100 years; and the leap-years begin the same course over again with respect to the days of the week on which the days of the months fall. The cycle of the moon, commonly called the golden number, is a revolution of 19 years; in which time, the conjunctions, oppositions, and other aspects of the moon, are within an hour and half of being the same as they were on the same days of the months 19 years before. The indiction is a revolution of 15 years, used only by the Romans for indicating the times of certain payments made by the subjects to the republic: It was established by Constantine, A.D. 312.\n\nThe year of our Saviour's birth, according to the vulgar era, was the 9th year of the solar cycle, the first year of the lunar cycle, and the 312th year after his birth was the first year of the Roman indiction. Therefore, to find the year of the solar cycle, add 9 to any given year of Christ, and divide the sum by 28, the quotient is the number of cycles elapsed since his birth, and the remainder is the cycle for the given year: If nothing remains, the cycle is 28. To find the lunar cycle, add 1 to the given year of Christ, and divide the sum by 19; the quotient is the number of cycles elapsed in the interval, and the remainder is the cycle for the given year: If nothing remains, the cycle is 19. Lastly, subtract 312 from the given year of Christ, and divide the remainder by 15; and what remains after this division is the indiction for the given year: If nothing remains, the indiction is 15.\n\nAlthough the above deficiency in the lunar circle of an hour and a half every 19 years be but small, yet in time it becomes so sensible as to make a whole natural day in 310 years. So that, although this cycle be of use, when the golden numbers are rightly placed against the days of the months in the calendar, as in our Common Prayer Books, for finding the days of the mean conjunctions or oppositions of the sun and moon, and consequently the time of Easter; it will only serve for 310 years, old style. For as the new and full moons anticipate a day in that time, the golden numbers ought\nIn the above table the golden numbers under the months stand against the days of new moon in the left-hand column, for the new style; adapted chiefly to the second year after leap-year, as being the nearest mean for all the four; and will serve till the year 1900. Therefore, to find the day of new moon in any month of a given year till that time, look for the golden number of that year under the desired month, and against it you have the day of new moon in the left-hand column.\n\nThus, suppose it were required to find the day of new moon in September 1769; the golden number for that year is 3, which I look for under September, and right against it in the left-hand column you will find 30, which is the day of new moon in that month. N.B. If all the golden numbers, except 17 and 6, were let one day lower in the table, it would serve from the beginning of the year 1900 till the end of the year 2199. The table at the end of this chapter shews the golden number for 4000 years after the birth of Christ, by looking for the even hundreds of any given year at the left hand, and for the rest to make up that year at the head of the table; and where the columns meet, you have the golden number (which is the same both in old and new style) for the given year. Thus, suppose the golden number was wanted for the year 1769; look for 1700 at the left hand of the table, and for 69 at the top of it; then guiding your eye downward from 69 to over-against 1700, you will find 3, which is the golden number for that year.\n\nBut because the lunar cycle of 19 years sometimes includes five leap-years, and at other times only four, this table will sometimes vary a day from the truth in leap-years after February. And it is impossible to have one more correct, unless we extend it to four times 19 or 76 years; in which there are 19 leap-years without a remainder. But even then to have it of perpetual use, it must be adapted to the old style; because, in every centurial year not divisible by 4, the regular course of leap-years is interrupted in the new; as will be the case in the year 1800.\n\nThe cycle of Easter, also called the Dionysian period, is a revolution of 532 years, found by multiplying the solar cycle 28 by the lunar cycle 19. If the new moons did not anticipate upon this cycle, Easter-day would always be the Sunday next after the first full moon, which follows the 21st of March. But, on account of the above anticipation, to which no proper regard was had before the late alteration of the style, the ecclesiastic Easter has several times been a week different from the true Easter within this last century: which inconvenience is now remedied by making the table, which used to find Easter for ever, in the Common Prayer Book, of no longer use than the lunar difference from the new style will admit of.\n\nThe earliest Easter possible is the 22nd of March, the latest the 25th of April. Within these limits are 35 days, and the number belonging to each of them is called the number of direction; because thereby the time of Easter is found for any given year.\n\nThe first seven letters of the alphabet are commonly placed in the annual almanacks, to show on what days of the week the days of the months fall throughout the year. And because one of those seven letters must necessarily stand against Sunday, it is printed in a capital form, and called the dominical letter: The other six being inserted in small characters, to denote the other six days of the week. Now, since a common Julian year contains 365 days, if this number be divided by 7\nAstronomy\n\n(the number of days in a week) there will remain one day. If there had been no remainder, it is plain the year would constantly begin on the same day of the week; but since one remains, it is plain, that the year must begin and end on the same day of the week; and therefore the next year will begin on the day following. Hence, when January begins on Sunday, A is the dominical or Sunday letter for that year: Then, because the next year begins on Monday, the Sunday will fall on the seventh day, to which is annexed the seventh letter G, which therefore will be the dominical letter for all that year; and as the third year will begin on Tuesday, the Sunday will fall on the sixth day; therefore F will be the Sunday letter for that year. Whence it is evident, that the Sunday letters will go annually in a retrograde order thus, G, F, E, D, C, B, A. And, in the course of seven years, if they were all common ones, the same days of the week and dominical letters would return to the same days of the months. But because there are 366 days in a leap-year, if this number be divided by 7, there will remain two days over and above the 52 weeks of which the year consists. And therefore, if the leap-year begins on Sunday, it will end on Monday; and the next year will begin on Tuesday, the first Sunday whereof must fall on the fifth of January, to which is annexed the letter F, not G, as in common years. By this means, the leap-year returning every fourth year, the order of the dominical letters is interrupted; and the series cannot return to its first state till after four times seven, or 28 years; and then the same days of the months return in order to the same days of the week as before.\n\nFrom the multiplication of the solar cycle of 28 years into the lunar cycle of 19 years, and the Roman indication of 15 years, arises the great Julian period, consisting of 7980 years, which had its beginning 764 years before Strouachius's supposed year of the creation\u2014(for no later could all the three cycles begin together) and it is not yet compleated: And therefore it includes all other cycles, periods, and eras. There is but one year in the whole period that has the same numbers for the three cycles of which it is made up: And therefore, if historians had remarked in their writings the cycles of each year, there had been no dispute about the time of any action recorded by them.\n\nThe Dionysian or vulgar era of Christ's birth was about the end of the year of the Julian period 4713; and consequently the first year of his age, according to that account, was the 4714th year of the said period. Therefore, if to the current year of Christ we add 4713, the sum will be the year of the Julian period. So the year 1769 will be found to be the 6432nd year of that period. Or, to find the year of the Julian period answering to any given year before the first year of Christ, subtract the number of that given year from 4714, and the remainder will be the year of the Julian period. Thus, the year 585 before the first year of Christ (which was the 584th before his birth) was the 4129th year of the said period. Lastly, to find the cycles of the sun, moon, and indication for any given year of this period, divide the given year by 28, 19, and 15; the three remainders will be the cycles sought, and the quotients the numbers of cycles run since the beginning of the period. So in the above 4714th year of the Julian period, the cycle of the sun was 10, the cycle of the moon 2, and the cycle of indication 4; the solar cycle having run through 168 courses, the lunar 248, and the indication 314.\n\nThe vulgar era of Christ's birth was never settled till the year 527, when Dionysius Exiguus, a Roman abbot, fixed it to the end of the 4713th year of the Julian period, which was four years too late. For our Saviour was born before the death of Herod, who sought to kill him as soon as he heard of his birth. And, according to the testimony of Josephus (B. xvii. ch. 8.) there was an eclipse of the moon in the time of Herod's last illness; which eclipse appears by our astronomical tables to have been in the year of the Julian period 4710, March 13th, at 3 hours past midnight, at Jerusalem. Now, as our Saviour must have been born some months before Herod's death, since in the interval he was carried into Egypt, the latest time in which we can fix the true era of his birth as about the end of the 4709th year of the Julian period.\n\nAs there are certain fixed points in the heavens from which astronomers begin their computations, so there are certain points of time from which historians begin to reckon; and these points or roots of time are called eras or epochs. The most remarkable eras are, those of the Creation, the Greek Olympiads, the building of Rome, the era of Nabonassar, the death of Alexander, the birth of Christ, the Arabian Hegira, and the Persian Jefdegird: All which, together with several others of less note, have their beginnings to the following table fixed to the years of the Julian period, to the age of the world at those times, and to the years before and after the year of Christ's birth.\n\n### Table of Remarkable Eras and Events\n\n| Event                                      | Julian Year of the Period | World Before Christ |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|\n| 1.

the world was created at the time of the autumnal equinox: But Mr Kennedy affirms, that the said equinox was at the noon of the fourth day of the creation-week, and that the moon was then 24 hours past her opposition to the sun.\u2014If Moses had told us the same things, we should have had sufficient data for fixing the era of the creation: But, as he has been silent on these points, we must consider the best accounts of chronologers as entirely hypothetical and uncertain.\n\n### Table, shewing the Golden Number, (which is the same both in the Old and New Style), from the Christian Era,

XIX. A Description of the Astronomical Machinery serving to explain and illustrate the foregoing part of this Treatise.**\n\nThe Orrery, (Plate XLVII. fig. 4.) This machine shews the motions of the sun, Mercury, Venus, earth, and moon; and occasionally the superior planets, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, may be put on; Jupiter's four satellites are moved round him in their proper times by a small winch; and Saturn has his five satellites, and his ring which keeps its parallelism round the sun; and by a lamp put in the sun's place, the ring shews all its various phases already described.\n\nIn the centre, No. 1. represents the sun, supported by its axis, inclining almost 9 degrees from the axis of the ecliptic; and turning round in 23\u00bd days on its axis, of which the north pole inclines toward the 8th degree of Pices in the great ecliptic, (No. 11.), whereon the months and days are engraven over the signs and degrees in which the sun appears, as seen from the earth, on the different days of the year.\n\nThe nearest planet (No. 2.) to the sun is Mercury, which goes round him in 87 days 23 hours, or 87\u00bd diurnal rotations of the earth; but has no motion round its axis in the machine, because the time of its diurnal motion in the heavens is not known to us.\n\nThe next planet in order is Venus, (No. 3.), which performs her annual course in 224 days 17 hours, and turns round her axis in 24 days 8 hours, or in 24\u00bd diurnal rotations of the earth. Her axis inclines 75 degrees from the axis of the ecliptic, and her north pole inclines towards...\ntowards the 20th degree of Aquarius, according to the observations of Bianchini. She shews all the phenomena described in Chap. I.\n\nNext, without the orbit of Venus, is the Earth, (No. 4.), which turns round its axis, to any fixed point at a great distance, in 23 hours 56 minutes 4 seconds, of mean solar time; but from the sun to the sun again, in 24 hours of the same time. No. 6. is a sidereal dial-plate under the earth, and No. 7. a solar dial-plate on the cover of the machine. The index of the former shews sidereal, and of the latter, solar time; and hence the former index gains one entire revolution on the latter every year, as 365 solar or natural days contain 366 sidereal days, or apparent revolutions of the stars. In the time that the earth makes 365 1/4 diurnal rotations on its axis, it goes once round the sun in the plane of the ecliptic; and always keeps opposite to a moving index (No. 10.) which shews the sun's daily change of place, and also the days of the months.\n\nThe earth is half covered with a black cap, for dividing the apparently enlightened half next the sun from the other half, which, when turned away from him, is in the dark. The edge of the cap represents the circle bounding light and darkness, and shews at what time the sun rises and sets to all places throughout the year. The earth's axis inclines 23\u00b0 27' degrees from the axis of the ecliptic, the north pole inclines toward the beginning of Cancer, and keeps its parallelism throughout its annual course; so that in summer the northern parts of the earth incline towards the sun, and in winter from him; by which means, the different lengths of days and nights, and the cause of the various seasons, are demonstrated to sight.\n\nThere is a broad horizon, to the upper side of which is fixed a meridian semicircle in the north and south points, graduated on both sides from the horizon to 90\u00b0 in the zenith or vertical point. The edge of the horizon is graduated from the east and west to the south and north points, and within these divisions are the points of the compass. From the lower side of this thin horizontal plate stand out four small wires, to which is fixed a twilight-circle :3 degrees from the graduated side of the horizon all round. This horizon may be put upon the earth, (when the cap is taken away), and rectified to the latitude of any place; and then, by a small wire called the solar ray, which may be put on to as to proceed directly from the sun's centre towards the earth's, but to come no farther than almost to touch the horizon. The beginning of twilight, time of sun-rising, with his amplitude, meridian altitude, time of setting, amplitude then, and end of twilight, are shewn for every day of the year, at that place to which the horizon is rectified.\n\nThe Moon (No. 5.) goes round the earth, from between it and any fixed point at a great distance, in 27 days 7 hours 43 minutes, or through all the signs and degrees of her orbit, which is called her periodical revolution; but she goes round from the sun to the sun again, or from change to change, in 29 days 12 hours 45 minutes, which is her synodical revolution; and in that time she exhibits all the phases already described.\n\nWhen the above mentioned horizon is rectified to the latitude of any given place, the times of the moon's rising and setting, together with her amplitude, are shewn to that place as well as the sun's; and all the various phenomena of the harvest-moon are made obvious to sight.\n\nThe moon's orbit (No. 9.) is inclined to the ecliptic, (No. 11.), one half being above, and the other below it. The nodes, or points at o and o', lie in the plane of the ecliptic, as before described, and shift backward through all its lines and degrees in 18 1/3 years. The degrees of the moon's latitude to the highest at NL (north latitude) and lowest at SL, (south latitude), are engraven both ways from her nodes at o and o'; and as the moon rises and falls in her orbit according to its inclination, her latitude and distance from her nodes are shewn for every day, having first rectified her orbit so as to set the nodes to their proper places in the ecliptic; and then, as they come about at different, and almost opposite times of the year, and then point towards the sun, all the eclipses may be shewn for hundreds of years, (without any new rectification), by turning the machinery backward for time past, or forward for time to come. At 17 degrees distance from each node, on both sides, is engraved a small sun; and at 12 degrees distance, a small moon; which shew the limits of solar and lunar eclipses; and when, at any change, the moon falls between either of these suns and the node, the sun will be eclipsed on the day pointed to by the annual index, (No. 10.); and as the moon has then north or south latitude, one may easily judge whether that eclipse will be visible in the northern or southern hemisphere; especially as the earth's axis inclines toward the sun or from him at that time. And when, at any full, the moon falls between either of the little moons and node, she will be eclipsed, and the annual index shews the day of that eclipse. There is a circle of 29 1/2 equal parts (No. 8.) on the cover of the machine, on which an index shews the days of the moon's age.\n\nThere are two semicircles (Plate XLVIII. fig. 1.) fixed to an elliptical ring, which being put like a cap upon the earth, and the forked part F upon the moon, shews the tides as the earth turns round within them, and they are led round it by the moon. When the different places come to the semicircle AaEbB, they have tides of flood; and when they come to the semicircle CED, they have tides of ebb; the index on the hour-circle (No. 7. Plate XLVII.) shewing the times of these phenomena.\n\nThere is a jointed wire, of which one end being put into a hole in the upright item that holds the earth's cap, and the wire laid into a small forked piece which may be occasionally put upon Venus or Mercury, shews the direct and retrograde motions of these two planets, with their stationary times and places, as seen from the earth.\n\nThe whole machinery is turned by a winch or handle, (No. 12.), and is so easily moved, that a clock might turn it without any danger of stopping.\n\nTo give a plate of the wheel-work of this machine, would answer no purpose, because many of the wheels lie so behind others as to hide them from sight in any view whatever.\n\nThe Cometarium, (Plate XLVIII. fig. 2.) This curious\nThis motion is performed in the following manner by the machine, (Plate XLVIII. fig. 3.). ABC is a wooden bar, (in the box containing the wheel-work,) above which are the wheels D and E, and below it the elliptic plates FF and GG; each plate being fixed on an axis in one of its focusses, at E and K; and the wheel E is fixed on the same axis with the plate FF. These plates have grooves round their edges precisely of equal diameters to one another, and in these grooves is the cat-gut string gg, gg crossing between the plates at h. On H, the axis of the handle or winch N in fig. 2. is an endless screw in fig. 3. working in the wheels D and E, whose numbers of teeth being equal, and should be equal to the number of lines aS, bS, cS, &c., in fig. 2. they turn round their axes in equal times to one another, and to the motion of the elliptic plates. For, the wheels D and E having equal numbers of teeth, the plate FF being fixed on the same axis with the wheel E, and the plate FF turning the equally big plate GG by a cat-gut string round them both, they must all go round their axes in as many turns of the handle N as either of the wheels has teeth.\n\nIt is easy to see, that the end b of the elliptical plate FF being farther from its axis E than the opposite end I is, must describe a circle so much larger in proportion, and therefore move through so much more space in the same time; and for that reason the end b moves so much faster than the end I, although it goes no sooner round the centre E. But then the quick-moving end b of the plate FF leads about the short end bK of the plate GG with the same velocity; and the slow-moving end I of the plate FF coming half round as to B, must then lead the long end k of the plate GG as slowly about; so that the elliptical plate FF and its axis E move uniformly and equally quick in every part of its revolution; but the elliptical plate GG, together with its axis K, must move very unequally in different parts of its revolution; the difference being always inversely as the distance of any point of the circumference of GG from its axis at K; or in other words, to instance in two points, if the distance Kk be four, five, or six times as great as the distance Kb, the point b will move in that position four, five, or six times as fast as the point k does, when the plate GG has gone half round; and so on for any other eccentricity or difference of the distances Kk and Kb. The tooth I on the plate FF falls in between the two teeth at k on the plate GG, by which means the revolution of the latter is so adjusted to that of the former, that they can never vary from one another.\n\nOn the top of the axis of the equally-moving wheel D in fig. 3. is the sun S in fig. 2.; which sun, by the wire fixed to it, carries the ball 1 round the circle ABCD, &c., with an equable motion, according to the order of the letters: and on the top of the axis K of the unequally-moving ellipse GG, in fig. 3. is the sun S in fig. 2. carrying the ball Y unequally round in the elliptical groove abcd, &c. N.B. This elliptical groove must be precisely equal and similar to the verge of the plate GG, which is also equal to that of FF.\n\nIn this manner machines may be made to show the\ntrue motion of the moon about the earth, or of any planet about the sun, by making the elliptical plates of the same eccentricities, in proportion to the radius, as the orbits of the planets are, whose motions they represent; and so their different equations in different parts of their orbits may be made plain to sight, and clearer ideas of these motions and equations acquired in half an hour, than could be gained from reading half a day about such motions and equations.\n\nThe Improved Celestial Globe, (Plate XLIV. fig. 2.) On the north pole of the axis, above the hour-circle, is fixed an arch MKH of $23\\frac{1}{2}$ degrees; and at the end H is fixed an upright pin HG, which stands directly over the north pole of the ecliptic, and perpendicular to that part of the surface of the globe. On this pin are two moveable collets at D and H, to which are fixed the quadrantile wires N and O, having two little balls on their ends for the sun and moon, as in the figure. The collet D is fixed to the circular plate F, whereon the $25\\frac{1}{2}$ days of the moon's age are engraven, beginning just under the sun's wire N; and as this wire is moved round the globe, the plate F turns round with it. These wires are easily turned, if the screw G be slackened; and when they are set to their proper places, the screw serves to fix them there so as in turning the ball of the globe, the wires with the sun and moon go round with it; and these two little balls rise and set at the same times, and on the same points of the horizon, for the day to which they are rectified, as the sun and moon do in the heavens.\n\nBecause the moon keeps not her course in the ecliptic, (as the sun appears to do), but has a declination of $5\\frac{1}{2}$ degrees on each side from it in every lunation, her ball may be screwed as many degrees to either side of the ecliptic as her latitude or declination from the ecliptic amounts to at any given time; and for this purpose S, Plate LI. fig. 2. (by mistake omitted to be inserted in the proper plate) is a small piece of pasteboard, of which the curved edge at S is to be set upon the globe at right angles to the ecliptic, and the dark line over S to stand upright upon it. From this line, on the convex edge, are drawn the $5\\frac{1}{2}$ degrees of the moon's latitude on both sides of the ecliptic; and when this piece is set upright on the globe, its graduated edge reaches to the moon on the wire O, by which means she is easily adjusted to her latitude found by an ephemeris.\n\nThe horizon is supported by two semicircular arches, because pillars would stop the progress of the balls when they go below the horizon in an oblique sphere.\n\nTo rectify this globe. Elevate the pole to the latitude of the place; then bring the sun's place in the ecliptic for the given day to the brass meridian, and set the hour-index to XII at noon, that is to the upper XII on the hour-circle; keeping the globe in that situation, slacken the screw G, and set the sun directly over his place on the meridian; which done, set the moon's wire under the number that expresses her age for that day on the plate F; and she will then stand over her place in the ecliptic, and shew what constellation she is in. Lastly, fasten the screw G, and laying the curved-edge of the pasteboard S over the ecliptic below the moon, adjust the moon to her latitude over the graduated edge of the pasteboard; and the globe will be rectified.\n\nHaving thus rectified the globe, turn it round, and observe on what points of the horizon the sun and moon balls rise and set, for these agree with the points of the compass on which the sun and moon rise and set in the heavens on the given day; and the hour-index shews the times of their rising and setting; and likewise the time of the moon's passing over the meridian.\n\nThis simple apparatus shews all the varieties that can happen in the rising and setting of the sun and moon; and makes the fore-mentioned phenomena of the harvest-moon plain to the eye. It is also very useful in reading lectures on the globes, because a large company can see this sun and moon go round, rising above and setting below the horizon at different times, according to the seasons of the year; and making their appulses to different fixed stars. But in the usual way, where there is only the places of the sun and moon in the ecliptic to keep the eye upon, they are easily lost sight of, unless they be covered with patches.\n\nThe Planetary Globe, (Plate XLIX. fig. 1.) In this machine, a terrestrial globe is fixed on its axis standing upright on the pedestal CDE, on which is an hour-circle, having its index fixed on the axis, which turns somewhat tightly in the pedestal, so that the globe may not be liable to shake; to prevent which, the pedestal is about two inches thick, and the axis goes quite through it, bearing on a shoulder. The globe is hung in a graduated brazen meridian, much in the usual way; and the thin plate N, NE, F is a moveable horizon graduated round the outer edge, for shewing the bearings and amplitudes of the sun, moon, and planets. The brass meridian is grooved round the outer edge; and in this groove is a slender semi-circle of brass, the ends of which are fixed to the the horizon in its north and south points: this semi-circle slides in the groove as the horizon is moved in rectifying it for different latitudes. To the middle of this semi-circle is fixed a pin, which always keeps in the zenith of the horizon, and on this pin the quadrant of altitude q turns; the lower end of which, in all positions, touches the horizon as it is moved round the same. This quadrant is divided into 90 degrees from the horizon to the zenithal pin on which it is turned, at 90. The great flat circle or plate AB is the ecliptic, on the outer edge of which the signs and degrees are laid down; and every fifth degree is drawn through the rest of the surface of this plate towards its center. On this plate are seven grooves, to which seven little balls are adjusted by sliding wires, so that they are easily moved in the grooves, without danger of starting them. The ball next the terrestrial globe is the moon, the next without it is Mercury, the next Venus, the next the sun, then Mars, then Jupiter, and lastly Saturn. This plate, or ecliptic, is supported by four strong wires, having their lower ends fixed into the pedestal, at C, D, E, the fourth being hid by the globe. The ecliptic is inclined $23\\frac{1}{2}$ degrees to the pedestal, and is therefore properly inclined to the axis of the globe which stands upright on the pedestal.\n\nTo rectify this machine. Set the sun, and all the planetary balls, to their geocentric places in the ecliptic for any given time, by an ephemeris; then set the north point of the\nthe horizon to the latitude of your place on the brass meridian, and the quadrant of altitude to the south point of the horizon; which done, turn the globe with its furniture till the quadrant of altitude comes right against the sun, viz., to his place in the ecliptic; and keeping it there, set the hour-index to the XII next the letter C; and the machine will be rectified, not only for the following problems, but for several others which the artist may easily find out.\n\n**Problem I.** To find the amplitudes, meridian altitudes, and times of rising, culminating, and setting, of the sun, moon, and planets.\n\nTurn the globe round eastward, or according to the order of signs; and as the eastern edge of the horizon comes right against the sun, moon, or any planet, the hour-index will shew the time of its rising; and the inner edge of the ecliptic will cut its rising amplitude in the horizon. Turn on, and as the quadrant of altitude comes right against the sun, moon or planets, the ecliptic cuts their meridian altitudes in the quadrant, and the hour-index shews the times of their coming to the meridian. Continue turning, and as the western edge of the horizon comes right against the sun, moon, or planets, their setting amplitudes are cut in the horizon by the ecliptic; and the times of their setting are shewn by the index on the hour-circle.\n\n**Prob. II.** To find the altitude and azimuth of the sun, moon, and planets, at any time of their being above the horizon.\n\nTurn the globe till the index comes to the given time in the hour-circle, then keep the globe steady, and moving the quadrant of altitude to each planet respectively, the edge of the ecliptic will cut the planet's mean altitude on the quadrant, and the quadrant will cut the planet's azimuth, or point of bearing on the horizon.\n\n**Prob. III.** The sun's altitude being given at any time either before or after noon, to find the hour of the day, and variation of the compass, in any known latitude.\n\nWith one hand hold the edge of the quadrant right against the sun; and, with the other hand, turn the globe westward, if it be in the forenoon, or eastward if it be in the afternoon, until the sun's place at the inner edge of the ecliptic cuts the quadrant in the sun's observed altitude; and then the hour-index will point out the time of the day, and the quadrant will cut the true azimuth, or bearing of the sun for that time: The difference between which, and the bearing shewn by the azimuth compass, shews the variation of the compass in that place of the earth.\n\nThe **Trajectorium Lunare**, Plate XLIX. fig. 2.\n\nThis machine is for delineating the paths of the earth and moon, shewing what sort of curves they make in the etherial regions. S is the sun, and E the earth, whose centres are 81 inches distant from each other; every inch answering to a million of miles. M is the moon, whose centre is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) parts of an inch from the earth's in this machine, this being in just proportion to the moon's distance from the earth. AA' is a bar of wood, to be moved by hand round the axis g which is fixed in the wheel T. The circumference of this wheel is to the circumference of the small wheel L (below the other end of the bar) as 365\\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) days is to 29\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), or as a year is to a lunation. The wheels are grooved round their edges, and in the grooves is the cat-gut string GG' croiling between the wheels at X. On the axis of the wheel L is the index F, in which is fixed the moon's axis M for carrying her round the earth E (fixed on the axis of the wheel L) in the time that the index goes round a circle of 29\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) equal parts, which are the days of the moon's age. The wheel T has the months and days of the year all round its limb; and in the bar AA' is fixed the index I, which points out the days of the months answering to the days of the moon's age, shewn by the index F, in the circle of 29\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) equal parts at the other end of the bar. On the axis of the wheel L is put the piece D, below the cock C, in which this axis turns round; and in D are put the pencils e and m, directly under the earth E and moon M; so that m is carried round e, as M is round E.\n\nLay the machine on an even floor, pressing gently on the wheel T, to cause its spiked feet (of which two appear at P and P', the third being supposed to be hid from sight by the wheel) enter a little into the floor to secure the wheel from turning. Then lay a paper about four feet long under the pencils e and m, cross-wise to the bar; which done, move the bar slowly round the axis g of the wheel T; and as the earth E goes round the sun S, the moon M will go round the earth with a duly proportioned velocity; and the friction-wheel W running on the floor, will keep the bar from bearing too heavily on the pencils e and m, which will delineate the paths of the earth and moon. As the index I points out the days of the months, the index F shews the moon's age on these days, in the circle of 29\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) equal parts. And as this last index points to the different days in its circle, the like numeral figures may be set to those parts of the curves of the earth's path and moon's, where the pencils e and m are at those times respectively, to shew the places of the earth and moon. If the pencil e be pushed a very little off, as if from the pencil m, to about \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) part of their distance, and the pencil m pushed as much towards e, to bring them to the same distances again, though not to the same points of space; then, as m goes round e, e will go as it were round the centre of gravity between the earth e and moon m; but this motion will not sensibly alter the figure of the earth's path or the moon's.\n\nIf a pin, as p, be put through the pencil m, with its head towards that of the pin q in the pencil e, its head will always keep thereto as m goes round e, or as the same side of the moon is still obverted to the earth. But the pin p, which may be considered as an equatorial diameter of the moon, will turn quite round the point m, making all possible angles with the line of its progress, o line of the moon's path. This is an ocular proof of the moon's turning round her axis.\nThe Tide-Dial, Plate L, fig. 1. The outside parts of this machine consist of, 1. An eight-sided box, on the top of which the corners is shown the phases of the moon at the octants, quarters, and full. Within there is a circle of 29 equal parts, which are the days of the moon's age accounted from the sun at new moon, round to the sun again. Within this circle is one of 24 hours divided into their respective halves and quarters. 2. A moving elliptical plate, painted blue, to represent the rising of the tides under and opposite to the moon; and has the words, high water, tide falling, low water, tide rising, marked upon it. To one end of this plate is fixed the moon M by the wire W, and goes along with it. 3. Above this elliptical plate is a round one, with the points of the compass upon it, and also the names of above 200 places in the large machine (but only 32 in the figure, to avoid confusion) set over those points in which the moon bears when she raises the tides to the greatest heights at these places twice in every lunar day: And to the north and south points of this plate are fixed two indexes I and K, which show the times of high water, in the hour circle, at all these places. 4. Below the elliptical plate are four small plates, two of which project out from below its ends at new and full moon; and so, by lengthening the ellipse, show the spring-tides, which are then raised to the greatest heights by the united attractions of the sun and moon. The other two of these small plates appear at low water when the moon is in her quadratures, or at the sides of the elliptic plate, to show the neap-tides; the sun and moon then acting cross-wise to each other. When any two of these small plates appear, the other two are hid; and when the moon is in her octants, they all disappear, their being neither spring nor neap-tides at those times. Within the box are a few wheels for performing these motions by the handle or winch H.\n\nTurn the handle until the moon M comes to any given day of her age in the circle of 29 equal parts, and the moon's wire W will cut the time of her coming to the meridian on that day, in the hour circle; the XII under the sun being mid-day, and the opposite XII midnight: Then looking for the name of any given place on the round plate (which makes 29 rotations whilst the moon M makes only one revolution from the sun to the sun again) turn the handle till that place comes to the word high water under the moon, and the index which falls among the forenoon hours will show the time of high water at that place in the forenoon of the given day: then turn the plate half round, till the same place comes to the opposite high-water mark, and the index will show the time of high water in the afternoon at that place. And thus, as all the different places come successively under and opposite to the moon, the indexes show the times of high water at them in both parts of the day: And, when the same places come to the low-water marks, the indexes show the times of low water. For about three days before and after the times of new and full moon, the two small plates come out a little way from below the high-water marks on the elliptical plate, to show that the tides rise still higher about these times: And about the quarters, the other two plates come out a little from under the low-water marks towards the sun, and on the opposite side, showing that the tides of flood rise not then so high, nor do the tides of ebb fall so low, as at other times.\n\nBy pulling the handle a little way outward, it is disengaged from the wheel-work, and then the upper plate may be turned round quickly by hand, so as the moon may be brought to any given day of her age in about a quarter of a minute; and by pushing in the handle, it takes hold of the wheel-work again.\n\nOn AB, (fig. 2) the axis of the handle H, is an endless screw C, which turns the wheel FED of 24 teeth round in 24 revolutions of the handle: This wheel turns another ONG of 48 teeth, and on its axis is the pinion P of four leaves, which turns the wheel LKI of 59 teeth round in 29\u00bd turnings or rotations of the wheel FED, or in 708 revolutions of the handle, which is the number of hours in a synodical revolution of the moon. The round plate, with the names of places upon it, is fixed on the axis of the wheel FED; and the elliptical or tide-plate with the moon fixed to it, is upon the axis of the wheel LKI; consequently, the former makes 29\u00bd revolutions in the time that the latter makes one. The whole wheel FED, with the endless screw C, and dotted part of the axis of the handle AB, together with the dotted part of the wheel ONG, lie hid below the large wheel LKI.","sp":517,"ep":604},{"h":"ASTROP-WELLS","t":"in Northamptonshire, were recommended by the physicians Willis and Clever, for the cure of the scurvy, asthma, &c.","sp":604,"ep":604},{"h":"ASTROSCOPE","t":"an instrument composed of two canes, having the constellations delineated on their surfaces, whereby the stars may be easily known.","sp":604,"ep":604},{"h":"ASTRUM","t":"with chemists, signifies that virtue which accrues to things from their preparation; and among ancient physicians, certain medicines in the figure of round cakes impressed with aftertaste.","sp":604,"ep":604},{"h":"ASTUR","t":"in ornithology, a synonyme of a species of falco.

The mandragora, or mandrake, a native of Spain and the East. The mandrake is divided into male and female. The male mandrake has a very large, long, and thick root; it is largest at the top or head, and from thence gradually grows smaller. Sometimes it is single and undivided to the bottom; but more frequently it is divided into two, sometimes into three, or more parts. From this root there arise a number of very long leaves, broadest in the middle, narrow towards the base, and obtusely pointed at the end; they are of a foot or more in length, and five inches or thereabouts in breadth; they are of a dusky and disagreeable green colour, and of a very fetid smell. The female mandrake perfectly resembles the other in its manner of growth; but the leaves are longer and narrower, and of a darker colour, as are also the seeds and roots. Authors have spoken very largely and idly of the virtues of this plant. The most common quality attributed to it, is that of rendering barren women fruitful; but we have no tolerable foundation for this; what we certainly know of it is, that it has a soporific virtue like that of opium; and the bark in small doses, Herman assures us, has often been known to do great service in hysterical complaints; but it should be used sparingly, otherwise it will often bring on convulsions, and many other mischievous symptoms. The ancients used it when they wanted a narcotic of the most powerful kind. 2. The balladona, or deadly nightshade, a native of Britain; the berries are poisonous. 3. The physalodes, a native of Peru. 4. The frutescens, a native of Spain; and, 5. The arboricola, a native of America.","sp":611,"ep":611},{"h":"ATROPHY","t":"in medicine, a disease, wherein the body, or some of its parts, do not receive the necessary nutriment, but waste and decay incessantly.

The chief hot baths in our country are those at Bath, near Wells, in Somersetshire; and those at Buxton and Matlock in Derbyshire.\n\nIn the city of Bath are four hot baths: one triangular, called the cross bath, the heat of which is more gentle than that of the rest, because it has fewer springs in it; the second is the hot bath, which was formerly much hotter than the rest, but it was then not so large as at present: the other two are the King's and Queen's Bath, divided only by a wall; the last having no spring, but receives its water from the King's Bath: each of these is furnished with a pump, to throw out the water upon the diseased, where that is required.\n\nThese waters abound with a mineral sulphur; they are hot, of a bluish colour, and strong scent; they do not pass through the body like most other mineral waters; though if salt be added, they purge presently. On settlements, they afford a black mud, which is used by way of cataplasm in aches, and proves of more service to some than the waters themselves: The like they deposit on distillation, and no other: The cross-bath preys on silver, all of them on iron, but none on brass.\n\nThe use of these baths is found beneficial in disorders of the head, as palsies, &c., in cuticular diseases, as leprosies, &c., obstructions, and constipations of the bowels, the scurvy and stone, and in most diseases of women and children; they are used as a last remedy in obstinate chronic diseases, where they succeed well, if they agree with the constitution of the patient.\n\nOf the three hot European waters of note, viz. Aix-la-Chapelle, Bourbon, and Bath, the first abounds more eminently in sulphur, which makes its heat, nauseousness, and purgative faculty so great, that few stomachs can bear it.\n\nThe Bourbon are of a middle nature, between the Aix-la-Chapelle and the Bath waters; being less hot, nauseous, and purgative than those of Aix-la-Chapelle; but more so than the Bath waters.\n\nCold baths were by the ancients held in the greatest esteem; and though they were long banished out of medicine, the present age can boast of abundance of noble cures performed by them, and such as were long attempted in vain by the most powerful medicines.\n\nThe cold bath is serviceable in most chronic disorders; it always acts the part of a diuretic; and will do more, especially plunging over head in sea-water, in the cure of melancholy, madness, and particularly that occasioned by the bite of a mad dog, than any other medicine.\n\nArtificial baths are various, according to the various occasions; as aqueous baths, vaporous baths, dry baths, &c. Aqueous baths are made from common plants, and other emollient, refulgent, and nervine substances; consisting sometimes of milk and emollient herbs, with rose-water, &c., when the design is to humectate, or when it is only to cleanse, it consists of bran and water alone; and when it is for an excessive pain or tumour, &c., in these cases it consists of a decoction of roots, plants, and some spirit of wine.\n\nIn vapour-baths, the design of which is to promote a perspiration, the steam or fume of some decoction is received upon some part of the body for that purpose. In these baths there is no part of the patient's body plunged into the decoction, only those parts which require it are properly disposed to receive the steams of some proper fermentation. Of this kind are the bag-nios, where persons are made to sweat by the heat of a room, and pouring on of hot water.\n\nVapour-baths are of singular service in cold distempers, anaemia's, edematous tumours, paralytic cases, swellings of the testicles, &c.\n\nDry baths are made of ashes, salt, sand, shreds of leather, &c. This bath is successful in provoking sweat in a plentiful manner, the patient being placed conveniently for the reception of the fumes: They are found useful in removing old obstinate pains, and are very effectual in venereal complaints.\n\nBath, in Hebrew antiquity, a measure of capacity, containing the tenth part of an omer, or seven gallons and four pints, as a measure for things liquid; or three pecks and three pints, as a measure for things dry.\n\nBaths, in architecture, superb buildings, erected for the sake of bathing.\n\nThose buildings, among the ancients, were most pompous and magnificent; such were those of Titus, Paulus Emilius, and Dioclesian, whose ruins are still remaining.\n\nBath, in geography, a city of Somersetshire, situated on the river Avon, ten miles east of Bristol, in 2\u00b0 30' W. long, and 51\u00b0 30' N. lat.\n\nBath is also the name of a town in Hungary, in 20\u00b0 40' E. long, and 46\u00b0 N. lat.\n\nKnights of the Bath, a military order in England, supposed to have been instituted by Richard II., who limited their number to four: However, his successor, Henry IV., increased them to forty-six. Their motto was tres in uno, signifying the three theological virtues.\n\nThis order received this denomination from a custom of bathing, before they received the golden spur. It is seldom ever conferred but at the coronation of kings, or the inauguration of a prince of Wales or Duke of York. They wear a red ribbon beltwise.\n\nThe order of the bath, after remaining many years extinct, was revived under George I., by a solemn creation of a great number of knights.\n\nBath-kol, the daughter of a voice. So the Jews call one of their oracles, which is frequently mentioned in their books, especially the Talmud, being a fantastic way of divination invented by the Jews themselves, not unlike the sortes virgilians of the heathens.

At Cambridge the degrees are usually taken much the same as at Oxford, excepting in law and physic, in either of which the bachelor's degree may be taken in six years.

Their wideness is two or three feet, but open to six or seven on the outside. The mass of earth that is betwixt two embrasures, is called the merlon. The platform of a battery is a floor of planks and sleepers, to keep the wheels of the guns from sinking into the earth; and is always made sloping towards the embrasures, both to hinder the reverse, and to facilitate the bringing back of the gun.\n\nBattery of mortars differs from a battery of guns, for it is sunk into the ground, and has no embrasures.\n\nCross-Batteries are two batteries, which play athwart one another, upon the same thing, forming there an angle, and beating with more violence and destruction; because what one bullet shakes, the other beats down.\n\nBattery sunk or buried, is when its platform is sunk, or let down into the ground, so that there must be trenches cut in the earth, against the muzzles of the guns, for them to fire out at, and to serve for embrasures.\n\nBattery d'enfilade, is one that scours, or sweeps the whole length of a straight line.\n\nBattery en echappe is that which plays obliquely.\nBattery de reverse, that which plays upon the enemy's back.\n\nCamerade Battery is when several guns play at the same time upon one place.\n\nBattery, in law, the striking, beating, or offering any violence to another person, for which damages may be recovered.\n\nBatteurs d'efrade, or Scouts, are horsemen sent out before, and on the wings of an army, one, two, or three miles, to make discoveries.\n\nBattle, a general engagement between two armies, in a country sufficiently open for them to encounter in front, and at the same time.\n\nOther great actions, though of a longer duration, and even attended with a greater slaughter, are only called fights.\n\nNaval Battle, the same with a sea-fight, or engagement between two fleets of men of war.\n\nBefore a naval battle, every squadron usually subdivides itself into three equal divisions, with a reserve of certain ships out of every squadron to bring up their rear.

Ecclesiastics have sometimes been enjoined to wear, and at other times have been forbid the wearing, the beard; and the Greek and Romish churches have been a long time by the ears, about their beards.

Objects of the other senses may be agreeable, such as the sounds of musical instruments, the smoothness and softness of some surfaces; but the agreeableness called beauty belongs to objects of sight.\n\nObjects of sight are more complex than those of any other sense: In the simplest, we perceive colour, figure, length, breadth, thickness. A tree is composed of a trunk, branches, and leaves; it has colour, figure, size, and sometimes motion: By means of each of these particulars, separately considered, it appears beauti-\nful; but a complex perception of the whole greatly augments the beauty of the object. The human body is a composition of numberless beauties arising from the parts and qualities of the object, various colours, various motions, figures, size, &c., all united in one complex object, and striking the eye with combined force. Hence it is, that beauty, a quality so remarkable in visible objects, lends its name to every thing that is eminently agreeable. Thus, by a figure of speech, we say, a beautiful sound, a beautiful thought, a beautiful discovery, &c.\n\nConsidering attentively the beauty of visible objects, two kinds are discovered. The first may be termed intrinsic beauty, because it is discovered in a single object, without relation to any other; the other may be termed relative, being founded on the relation of objects. Intrinsic beauty is a perception of sense merely; for to perceive the beauty of a spreading oak, or of a flowing river, no more is required but singly an act of vision. Relative beauty is accompanied with an act of understanding and reflection; for we perceive not the relative beauty of a fine instrument or engine, until we learn its use and destination. In a word, intrinsic beauty is ultimate; and relative beauty is that of means relating to some good end or purpose. These different beauties agree in one capital circumstance, that both are equally perceived as belonging to the object; which will be readily admitted with respect to intrinsic beauty, but is not so obvious with respect to the other. The utility of the plough, for example, may make an object of admiration or of desire; but why should utility make it beautiful? A natural propensity of the human mind will explain this difficulty: By an easy transition of ideas, the beauty of the effect is transferred to the cause, and is perceived as one of the qualities of the cause: Thus a subject void of intrinsic beauty, appears beautiful by its utility; a dwelling-house void of all regularity, is however beautiful in the view of convenience: and the want of symmetry in a tree, will not prevent its appearing beautiful, if it be known to produce good fruit.\n\nWhen these two beauties concur in any object, it appears delightful. Every member of the human body possesses both in a high degree.\n\nThe beauty of utility, being accurately proportioned to the degree of utility, requires no illustration: But intrinsic beauty being more complex, cannot be handled distinctly without being analysed. If a tree be beautiful by means of its colour, figure, motion, size, &c., it is in reality possessed of so many different beauties. The beauty of colour is too familiar to need explanation. The beauty of figure is more; for example, viewing any body as a whole, the beauty of its figure arises from regularity and simplicity; viewing the parts with relation to each other, uniformity, proportion, and order, contribute to its beauty. The beauties of grandeur and motion must be considered separately. See Grandeur, and Motion.\n\nWe shall here make a few observations on simplicity, which may be of use in examining the beauty of single objects. A multitude of objects crowding into the mind at once, disturb the attention, and pass without making any lasting impression: In the same manner, even a single object, consisting of a multiplicity of parts, equals not, in strength of impression, a more simple object comprehended in one view. This justifies simplicity in works of art, as opposed to complicated circumstances and crowded ornaments.\n\nIt would be endless to enumerate the effects that are produced by the various combinations of the principles of beauty. A few examples will be sufficient to give the reader some idea of this subject. A circle and a square are each perfectly regular; a square, however, is less beautiful than a circle; and the reason is, that the attention is divided among the sides and angles of a square; whereas the circumference of a circle, being a single object, makes one entire impression: And thus simplicity contributes to beauty. For the same reason, a square is more beautiful than a hexagon or octagon. A square is likewise more beautiful than a parallelogram, because it is more regular and uniform. But this holds with respect to intrinsic beauty only; for in many instances, as in the doors and windows of a dwelling-house, utility turns the scales on the side of the parallelogram.\n\nAgain, a parallelogram depends, for its beauty, on the proportion of its sides: A great inequality of its sides annihilates its beauty: Approximation toward equality hath the same effect; for proportion there degenerates into imperfect uniformity, and the figure appears an unsuccessful attempt toward a square. And hence proportion contributes to beauty.\n\nAn equilateral triangle yields not to a square in regularity nor in uniformity of parts, and it is more simple. But an equilateral triangle is less beautiful than a square; which must be owing to inferiority of order in the position of its parts; the order arising from the equal inclination of the sides of such an angle, is more obscure than the parallelism of the sides of a square. And hence order contributes to beauty not less than simplicity, regularity, or proportion.\n\nUniformity is singular in one circumstance, that it is apt to disgust by excess. A number of things destined for the same use, as windows, chairs, &c., cannot be too uniform. But a scrupulous uniformity of parts in a large garden or field, is far from being agreeable.\n\nIn all the works of nature, simplicity makes a capital figure. It also makes a figure in works of art: Profuse ornament in paintings, gardening, or architecture, as well as in dress or in language, shows a mean or corrupted taste. Simplicity in behaviour and manners has an enchanting effect, and never fails to gain our affection. Very different are the artificial manners of modern times. A gradual progress from simplicity to complex forms and profuse ornament, seems to be the fate of all the fine arts; resembling behaviour, which from original candor and simplicity, has degenerated into duplicity of heart and artificial refinements. At present literary productions are crowded with words, epithets, figures: In music, sentiment is neglected for the luxury of harmony, and for difficult movement.\n\nWith regard to the final cause of beauty, one thing is evident, that our relish of regularity, uniformity, proportion,\nportion, order, and simplicity contributes greatly to enhance the beauty of the objects that surround us, and of course tends to our happiness. We may be confirmed in this thought, upon reflecting, that our taste for these particulars is not accidental, but uniform and universal, making a branch of our nature. At the same time, regularity, uniformity, order, and simplicity, contribute, each of them, to readiness of apprehension, and enable us to form more distinct ideas of objects than can be done where these particulars are wanting. In some instances, as in animals, proportion is evidently connected with utility, and is the more agreeable on that account.\n\nBeauty, in many instances, promotes industry, and as it is frequently connected with utility, it proves an additional incitement to enrich our fields and improve our manufactures. These, however, are but slight effects, compared with the connections that are formed among individuals in society by means of beauty. The qualifications of the head and heart are undoubtedly the most solid and most permanent foundations of such connections; But, as external beauty lies more in view, and is more obvious to the bulk of mankind than the qualities now mentioned, the sense of beauty has a more extensive influence in forming these connections. At any rate, it concurs in an eminent degree with mental qualifications, in producing social intercourse, mutual good-will, and consequently mutual aid and support, which are the life of society. It must not however be overlooked, that the sense of beauty does not tend to advance the interests of society, but when in a due mean with respect to strength. Love, in particular, arising from a sense of beauty, loses, when excessive, its social character; the appetite for gratification, prevailing over affection for the beloved object, is ungovernable, and tends violently to its end, regardless of the misery that must follow. Love, in this state, is no longer a sweet agreeable passion; it becomes painful, like hunger or thirst, and produces no happiness, but in the instant of fruition. This suggests an important lesson, that moderation in our desires and appetites, which fits us for doing our duty, contributes at the same time the most to happiness; even social passions, when moderate, are more pleasant than when they swell beyond proper bounds.","sp":642,"ep":644},{"h":"BEAUTY","t":"in architecture, painting, and other arts, is the harmony and justness of the whole composition taken together.","sp":644,"ep":644},{"h":"BEAUVIN","t":"a city of Burgundy, in France, about 15 miles north of Chalons, in 4\u00b0 50' E. long. and 47\u00b0 N. lat.","sp":644,"ep":644},{"h":"BEAUVOIR","t":"a port-town of France, about 25 miles south-west of Nantes, in 2\u00b0 W. long. and 47\u00b0 N. lat.","sp":644,"ep":644},{"h":"BEAUVOIS","t":"a city of the isle of France, about 43 miles north of Paris, in 2\u00b0 20' E. long. and 4\u00b0 30' N. lat.","sp":644,"ep":644},{"h":"BECAH","t":"or Bekah, in Hebrew antiquity, a Jewish coin, equal to 13\u00bd d. of our money.","sp":644,"ep":644},{"h":"BECALM","t":"in the sea language.

The first, which is brought from Persia and the East Indies, is found in the stomach of the capra bezoardica, and esteemed by physicians to be the best. It is called oriental bezoar, and is of a shining dark-green or olive-colour, and has an even smooth surface. On removing the outer coat, that which lies underneath is likewise smooth and thinning. It is generally less than a walnut.\n\nThe second kind, called occidental bezoar, is brought from the Spanish West Indies, has a rough surface, and less of a green colour than the oriental. It is likewise much heavier, more brittle, and of a looser texture; the coats are thicker, and, on breaking, exhibits a number of strice curiously interwoven.

Many of them are indeed evidently made by art. The usual mark to distinguish its being of a good quality, is its striking a deep green colour on white paper that has been rubbed with chalk. But it is of little importance to say much on this subject. The stone is nothing more than a morbid concretion, much of the same nature with the human calculus, of no smell or taste, indigestible in the stomach of the animal in which it is found, and scarce capable of being acted upon by any of the juices of the human body; and, notwithstanding its many boasted virtues, it cannot be considered in any other light than as an absorbent of the weakest kind.

The Jews called the Bible (that is, the Old Testament) mikra, which signifies Lesson, or Lectura.\n\nThis collection of the sacred writings, containing those of the Old and New Testament, is justly looked upon as the foundation of the Jewish as well as the Christian religion. The Jews, it is true, acknowledge only the scriptures of the Old Testament, the correcting and publishing of which is unanimously ascribed, both by the Jews and Christians, to Ezra. Some of the ancient fathers, on no other foundation than that fabulous and apocryphal book, the second book of Esdras, pretend, that the scriptures were entirely lost and destroyed at the Babylonish captivity, and that Ezra restored them all again by divine revelation. What is certain is, that in the reign of Josiah there was no other book of the law extant besides that found in the temple by Hilkiah; from which original, by order of that pious king, copies were immediately written out, and search made for all the other parts of the scriptures, (2 Kings xxii.) by which means copies of the whole became multiplied among the people, who carried them with them into their captivity. After the return of the Jews from the Babylonish captivity, Ezra got together as many copies as he could of the Sacred writings, and out of them all prepared a correct edition, disposing the several books in their proper order, and settling the canon of scripture for his time. These books he divided into three parts. 1. The Law. 2. The Prophets. 3. The Ketubim, or Hagiographia, i.e. The holy writings.\n\nI. The Law contains, 1. Genesis. 2. Exodus. 3. Leviticus. 4. Numbers. 5. Deuteronomy.\n\nII. The writings of the Prophets are, 1. Joshua. 2. Judges, with Ruth. 3. Samuel. 4. Kings. 5. Isaiah. 6. Jeremiah, with his Lamentations. 7. Ezekiel. 8. Daniel. 9. The twelve minor Prophets. 10. Job. 11. Ezra. 12. Nehemiah. 13. Esther.\n\nIII. And the Hagiographia consists of, 1. The Psalms. 2. The Proverbs. 3. Ecclesiastes. 4. The Song of Solomon. This division was made for the sake of reducing the number of the sacred books to the number of the letters in their alphabet, which amount to twenty-two. At present, the Jews reckon twenty-four books in their canon of scripture, in disposing of which the law stands as it did in the former division, and the prophets are distributed into the former and latter prophets.\n\nThe former prophets are, Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings.\n\nThe latter prophets are, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the twelve minor prophets.\n\nAnd the hagiographia consists of,\n\nThe Psalms, the Proverbs, Job, the Song of Solomon, Ruth, the Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther, Daniel, Ezra, the Chronicles.\n\nUnder the name of Ezra, they comprehend Nehemiah. It is true this order hath not always been observed, but the variations from it are of little or no moment.\n\nThe five books of the law are divided into fifty-four sections. This division many of the Jews hold to have been appointed by Moses himself; but others, with more probability, ascribe it to Ezra. The design of this division was, that one of these sections might be read in their synagogues every sabbath-day. The number was 54, because in their intercalated years, a month being then added, there were 54 sabbaths. In other years, they reduced them to 52, by twice joining together two short sections. Till the persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes, they read only the law; but the reading of it being then prohibited, they substituted in the room of it 54 sections out of the Prophets; and when the reading of the law was restored by the Maccabees, the section which was read every sabbath out of the law, served for their first lesson, and the section out of the prophets for their second. These sections were divided into verses, of which division, if Ezra was not the author, it was introduced not long after him, and seems to have been designed for the use of the Targumists, or Chaldee interpreters; for after the return of the Jews from the Babylonish captivity, when the Hebrew language had ceased to be their mother tongue, and the Chaldee grew into use instead of it, the custom was, that the law should be first read in the original Hebrew, and then interpreted to the people in the Chaldee language, for which purpose these shorter sections or periods were very convenient.\n\nThe division of the scriptures into chapters, as we at present have them, is of much later date. Some attribute it to Stephen Langton, archbishop of Canterbury, in the reigns of John and Henry III. But the true author of the invention was Hugo de Sancto Caro, commonly called Hugo Cardinalis, because he was the first Dominican that ever was raised to the degree of cardinal. This Hugo flourished about the year 1240. He wrote a comment on the scriptures, and projected the first concordance, which is that of the vulgar Latin Bible. The aim of this work being for the more easy finding out any word or passage in the scriptures, he found it necessary to divide the book into sections, and the sections into subdivisions; for till that time the vulgar Latin Bibles were without any division at all. These sections are the chapters into which the Bible hath ever since been divided. But the subdivision of the chapters was not then into verses, as it is now. Hugo's method of subdividing them was by the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, placed in the margin at an equal distance from each other, according to the length of the chapters. The subdivision of the chapters into verses, as they now stand in our Bibles, had its origin from a famous Jewish rabbi, named Mordecai Nathan, about the year 1445. This rabbi, in imitation of Hugo Cardinalis, drew up a concordance.\nance to the Hebrew Bible, for the use of the Jews. But though he followed Hugo in his division of the books into chapters, he refined upon his invention as to the subdivision, and contrived that by verses: this being found to be a much more convenient method, it has been ever since followed. And thus, as the Jews borrowed the division of the books of the holy scriptures into chapters from the Christians, in like manner the Christians borrowed that of the chapters into verses from the Jews.\n\nThe order and division of the books of the Bible, as well of the Old as the New Testament, according to the disposition made by the council of Trent, by decree I. session iv., are as follow; where we are to observe, that those books to which the asterisks are prefixed, are rejected by the Protestants, as apocryphal.

The authors of these annals were the prophets, who lived in the kingdoms of Judah and Israel. We have likewise but a part of Solomon's three thousand proverbs, and his thousand and five songs, (1 Kings iv. 32.); and we have entirely lost what he wrote upon plants, animals, birds, fishes, and reptiles.\n\nEsdras, in the opinion of most learned men, published the scriptures in the Chaldee character: For that language being grown wholly into use among the Jews, he thought proper to change the old Hebrew character for it, which hath since that time been retained only by the Samaritans, among whom it is preferred to this day.\n\nPrideaux\nPrideaux is of opinion that Ezra made additions in several parts of the Bible, where anything appeared necessary for illustrating, connecting, or completing the work; in which he appears to have been assisted by the same spirit in which they were first written. Among such additions are to be reckoned the last chapter of Deuteronomy, wherein Moses seems to give an account of his own death and burial, and the succession of Joshua after him. To the same cause our learned author thinks are to be attributed many other interpolations in the Bible, which created difficulties and objections to the authenticity of the sacred text, no ways to be solved without allowing them. Ezra changed the names of several places which were grown obsolete, and instead of them put their new names, by which they were then called, in the text. Thus it is that Abraham is said to have pursued the kings who carried Lot away captive, as far as Dan; whereas that place in Moses's time was called Laish; the name Dan, being unknown till the Danites, long after the death of Moses, possessed themselves of it.\n\nThe Jewish canon of scripture was then settled by Ezra, yet not so but that several variations have been made in it. Malachi, for instance, could not be put in the Bible by him, since that prophet is allowed to have lived after Ezra; nor could Nehemiah be there, since mention is made, in that book, of Jaddus, as high-priest, and of Darius Codomannus, as king of Persia, who were at least an hundred years later than Ezra. It may be added, that in the first book of Chronicles, the genealogy of the sons of Zerubbabel is carried down for so many generations as must necessarily bring it to the time of Alexander, and consequently this book could not be in the canon in Ezra's days. It is probable, the two books of Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, and Malachi, were adopted into the Bible in the time of Simon the Just, the last of the men of the great synagogue.\n\nAs the Jews were very backward in having any intercourse with strangers, it was a long time before their sacred books came to be known and read in other nations. Josephus attributes the little that is said of the Jews by pagan writers to this, that the latter had no opportunity of being acquainted with their historians, for want of a translation of their books into the Greek language. Aristeas indeed pretends, that there was an imperfect version of the scriptures before the time of Demetrius Phalereus; and that Theopompus intending to insert a part of them in his verses, was deprived of his understanding; but of this there is no proof.\n\nThe Jews, upon their return from the Babylonish captivity, having brought with them their Chaldaic or Assyrian language, which from that time became their mother-tongue, gave birth to the Chaldee translations, or rather paraphrases of the Bible, called Targum. See Targum.\n\nGreek Bible. It is a matter of dispute among authors whether there was a Greek version of the Old Testament more ancient than the Septuagint. See Septuagint.\n\nBefore our Saviour's time, there was no other Greek version of the Old Testament, besides that which went under the name of the Septuagint: But after the establishment of Christianity, some authors undertook new translations, under pretence of making them more conformable to the Hebrew text. The first who performed this design was the Jewish proflyte Aquila, of the city of Synope in Pontus, disciple to Rabbi Akiba, who put it in execution the twelfth year of the emperor Adrian, A.D. 128. St Epiphanius pretends, that being excommunicated after his conversion, for addicting himself to judicial astrology, he set about this version out of hatred to the Christians, and with a wicked design of corrupting the passages of the prophets relating to Jesus Christ. St Jerome says, his version is made word for word, and with too scrupulous a nicety.\n\nThe second Greek version after the Septuagint is that of Symmachus, a Samaritan by birth, who first turned Jew, then Christian, and at last Ebionite. He composed it, according to Epiphanius, in the reign of the emperor Severus. His version was more free than the rest; for he applied himself chiefly to the sense, without translating word for word; wherefore his version comes nearer the Septuagint than that of Aquila. The third Greek version is that of Theodotion of Ephesus. It is said he was a disciple of Marcion, and that, having had some difference with those of his sect, he turned Jew. The version of this author was the best of the three, because he kept a just medium between Aquila and Symmachus, not confining himself so servilely to the letter as the first did, nor wandering so far from it as the second did.\n\nThere were, besides these, three other Greek versions, whose authors are unknown.\n\nSyriac Bible. The Syrians have in their language a version of the Old Testament, which they pretend to be of great antiquity. A great part of it, they say, was made in Solomon's time, and the rest in the time of Abgarus king of Edessa. They relate, that Hiram king of Tyre desired Solomon to communicate the use of letters and writing to the Syrians, and to get translated for them the sacred books of the Hebrews; which Solomon complied with, and sent them the Pentateuch, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, Samuel, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Solomon's Song, and Job, which were the only books then extant; the remaining books of scripture, they add, were translated into Syriac after the death of Christ, by the care of Abgarus king of Edessa. But this account is looked upon as fabulous. It is true, the Syriac version which we have now must be very ancient, since it is often cited by the fathers. Dr Prideaux is of opinion, it was made within the first century; that the author of it was some Christian of the Jewish nation; and that it is the best translation of the Old Testament. This version is not always agreeable to the original; but in some places is more conformable to the Samaritan Pentateuch, and in some to the version of the Septuagint. In the Psalms, the translator has taken the liberty to leave out the ancient titles and inscriptions of each psalm, instead of which he gives an abstract of the contents of each psalm.\n\nLatin Bible. It is past dispute, that the Latin churches had, even in the first ages, a translation of the Bible in their language, which being the vulgar language, and consequently understood by every one, occasioned a vast number of Latin versions. Among all these, there was one which was generally received, and called by St Jerom the vulgar, or common translation. St Au-\nSt Jerome gives this version the name of the Italic, and prefers it to all the rest: But we reserve a distinct article for this version. See Vulgate.\n\nSt Jerome undertook to revise and correct the Latin version of the Bible; but, having afterwards attained to a more perfect knowledge of the Hebrew language, he set about a new translation of some books of the Old Testament from the Hebrew; and continuing, at the solicitation of his friends, to translate the rest, he at last perfected an entire new version of all the books contained in the Hebrew canon. In his translation, he followed, as nearly as he could, the version of the Septuagint, and retained the very expressions of the ancient vulgar Latin, as far as was consistent with purity of style and true Latinity. This translation was so highly applauded by the Christian church, that some authors have pretended it was brought to perfection by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. But St Augustine looked upon the author to be so well skilled in the Hebrew language, as to be able to undertake, and bring to perfection such a work by the strength of his own abilities. St Jerome's version was soon received in many churches; and in the sixth century it became as general, and in as great esteem, as the ancient Vulgate.\n\nIt was not till the sixteenth century that any new Latin translations were made of the Bible from the Hebrew text. Sanctus Pagninus, a Dominican monk, was the first who undertook a new version of the books of scripture from the modern Hebrew text. His design was encouraged by pope Leo X.; and his version made its first appearance at Lyons in the year 1527. It adheres too scrupulously to the words of the text, which makes it obscure, and favour of barbarity in many places. He is likewise often misled as to the sense, having affected too much to follow the explications of the Jewish Rabbins. It is however a very useful work, and very proper to explain the literal sense of the Hebrew text. Arias Montanus, when he compiled the edition of the Biblia Polyglotta, revised this translation of Pagninus.\n\nCardinal Cajetan, though not versed in the Hebrew, undertook a translation of some parts of the Bible by the assistance of two persons well skilled in that language, the one a Jew, the other a Christian. After him Isidore Clarius, a monk of Mount Cassin, set himself to reform the vulgar version of the Bible after the Hebrew text; in the doing of which he pretends to have corrected above eight thousand passages of the Bible. Besides these translations, made by catholic authors, there are some likewise performed by protestant translators; the first of whom was Sebastian M\u00fcnster. His version is more intelligible, and in much better Latin, than that of Pagninus. Huetius bestows on him the character of a translator well versed in the Hebrew, and whose style is very exact and conformable to the original. The translation of Leo Juda, a Zuingleian, printed at Zurich in 1543, and afterwards by Robert Stephens in 1545, is written in a more elegant style than that of M\u00fcnster; but he often departs from the literal meaning of the Hebrew text for the sake of an elegant Latin expression. However, in this he has not taken so great a liberty as Sebastian Castalio, who undertook to give the world an elegant Latin version of the Bible: But there are critics who censure him for departing from the noble simplicity and natural grandeur of the original, and deviating into an affected effeminate style, overcharged with false rhetoric, and not always true Latinity. The version of Junius and Tremellius, has much more of the true natural simplicity: The chief Hebraisms are preserved in it, and the whole is strictly conformable to the Hebrew text. We must not forget the version of Theodore Beza, a protestant divine of Geneva, in the sixteenth century. Sebastian Castalio found fault with this version, and Beza wrote an apology for it about the year 1564.\n\nArabic Bible. The Arabic versions of the Bible are of two sorts; the one done by Christians, the other by Jews. There is one of the Old Testament, whose author is supposed to be Saadia Gaon, a Jew of Babylon, who wrote the same about the year of Christ 900. Of this whole work the Pentateuch alone is printed. The Jews have another Arabic version in Hebrew characters, which Erpenius published in Arabic characters at Leyden in the year 1622. Among the Arabic translations done by Christians, there is one printed in the polyglots of Paris and London; but both the author, and the time when it was written, are unknown. It must have been made since the publication of the Koran, because the author, in many places, has evidently followed it. In this version the Pentateuch is translated from the Hebrew text; Job, from the Syriac; and the rest from the Septuagint, and two other versions of the Pentateuch, the manuscripts of which are in the Bodleian library. There are also some Arabic translations of the Psalms; one printed at Genoa in 1516, the other at Rome in 1619: And there is a manuscript version of the prophets in this language preserved in the Bodleian library.\n\nThe gospel being preached in all nations, there is no doubt, but that the Bible, which is the foundation of the Christian religion, was translated into the respective languages of each nation. St Chrysostom and Theodoret both testify, that the books of the Old and New Testament had been translated into the Syrian, Egyptian, Indian, Persian, Armenian, Ethiopic, Scythian, and Samaritan languages. Socrates and Sozomen tell us, that Ulphilas bishop of the Goths, who lived about the middle of the fourth century, had translated the holy scriptures into the Gothic language; and pope John VIII. gave his approbation to the version of the holy scriptures made into the Slavonian.\n\nEthiopic Bible. The Ethiopic version of the Old Testament is made immediately from the Greek text of the Septuagint; and there is a very plain agreement between this translation and the Alexandrian manuscript: The order of the chapters, the inscriptions of the Psalms, and every thing else being exactly alike. The Ethiopians attribute this version to Frumentius, the apostle of Ethiopia, sent thither by Athanasius bishop of Alexandria.\n\nCoptic or Egyptian Bible. The Coptic or Egyptian translation is likewise made from the Greek of the Septuagint, in which the Egyptian translator so punctually followed the Greek text, that he refused to make use of the labours of Origen and others, who had been at the pains\npains to compare the Greek version with the Hebrew text. We are quite in the dark as to the author and the time of this version, but probably it is very ancient, since we cannot suppose the Egyptian church was long without a translation of the scriptures in their mother tongue.\n\nPersian and Turkish Bible. There are several versions of the Bible in the Persian language, most of which are in manuscript. There is a translation of the Psalms by one father John, a Carmelite; and another of the same book done from the Latin by the Jesuits. Walton, in the London Polyglott, has published the Gospels, translated by one Simon the son of Joseph, a Christian of Persia, who lived in the year 1341. We have likewise some manuscript translations of the Bible in the Turkish language, particularly a version of the New Testament printed at London in the year 1666.\n\nArmenian and Georgian Bible. The Armenians have an old translation of the scriptures in their language, taken from the Greek of the Septuagint. Three learned Armenians were employed about it, in the time of the emperor Arcadius, viz. Moses named the Grammarian, David the Philosopher, and Mampruzus. The Armenians, in 1666, procured an edition of the Bible in their language to be made at Amsterdam, under the direction of an Armenian bishop. Another was printed at Antwerp in 1670, by the procurement of Theodorus Patraeus, and the New Testament separately in 1668.\n\nThe Georgians have likewise a translation of the Bible in the old Georgian language: But as this language is known only to a very few persons, and the people of the country are extremely ignorant, there is scarce any one who either reads or understands this version.\n\nWhilst the Roman empire subsisted in Europe, the reading of the scriptures in the Latin tongue, which was the universal language of that empire, prevailed everywhere. But since the face of affairs in Europe has been changed, and so many different monarchies erected upon the ruins of the Roman empire, the Latin tongue has by degrees grown into disuse; whence has arisen a necessity of translating the Bible into the respective languages of each people; and this has produced as many different versions of the scriptures in the modern languages, as there are different nations professing the Christian religion. Hence we meet with French, Italian, Spanish, German, Flemish, Danish, Slavonian, Polish, Bohemian, and Russian or Mulcovite Bibles; besides the Anglo-Saxon and modern English and Irish Bibles.\n\nFrench Bible. The oldest French Bible we hear of is the version of Peter de Vaux, chief of the Waldenses, who lived about the year 1160. Raoul de Presle translated the Bible into French in the reign of Charles V., king of France, about the year 1380. Besides these, there are several old French translations of particular parts of the scripture. The doctors of Louvain published the Bible in French at Louvain, by order of the emperor Charles V. in 1550. There is a version by Isaac le Ma\u00eetre de Sacy, published in 1672, with explanations of the literal and spiritual meaning of the text, which was received with wonderful applause, and has been often reprinted. As to the New Testaments in French, which have been printed separately, one of the most remarkable is that of P. Amelotte of the oratory, composed by the direction of some French prelates, and printed with annotations in the year 1666, 1667, and 1670. The author pretends he had been at the pains to search all the libraries in Europe, and collate the oldest manuscripts. But, in examining his work, it appears that he has produced no considerable various readings, which had not before been taken notice of either in the London Polyglott or elsewhere. The New Testament of Mons printed in 1665, with the archbishop of Cambrai's permission, and the king of Spain's licence, made a great noise in the world. It was condemned by pope Clement IX. in 1668, and by pope Innocent XI. in 1679, and in several bishoprics of France at several times. The New Testament published at Trevoux in 1702, by M. Simon, with literal and critical annotations upon difficult passages, was condemned by the bishops of Paris and Meaux in 1702. F. Bohours, a Jesuit, with the assistance of F. Michael Tellier, and Peter Bernier, Jesuits likewise, published a translation of the New Testament in 1697; but this translation is, for the most part, harsh and obscure, which was owing to the author's keeping too strictly to the Latin text from which he translated.\n\nThere are likewise French translations published by Protestant authors; one by Robert Peter Olivetan, printed at Geneva in 1535, and since often reprinted with the corrections of John Calvin and others; another by Sebastian Castalio, remarkable for particular ways of expression never used by good judges of the language. John Diodati likewise published a French Bible at Geneva in 1644; but some find fault with his method, in that he rather paraphrases the text than translates it. Faber Stapulensis translated the New Testament into French, which was revised and accommodated to the use of the reformed churches in Piedmont, and printed in 1534. Lastly, M. John Le Clerc published a New Testament in French at Amsterdam in 1703, with annotations taken chiefly from Grotius and Hammond; but the use of this version was prohibited in Holland by order of the States-General, as tending to revive the errors of Sabellius and Socinus.\n\nItalian Bible. The first Italian Bible published by the Romanists, is that of Nicolas Malerme, a Benedictine monk, printed at Venice in 1471. It was translated from the Vulgate. The version of Anthony Brucioli, published at Venice in 1532, was prohibited by the council of Trent. The Calvinists likewise have their Italian Bibles. There is one of John Diodati in 1607 and 1641, and another of Maximus Theophilus in 1551, dedicated to Francis de Medici duke of Tuscany. The Jews of Italy have no entire version of the Bible in Italian; the inquisition constantly refusing to allow them the liberty of printing one.\n\nSpanish Bible. The first Spanish Bible that we hear of, is that mentioned by Cyprian de Valera, which he says was published about the year 1500. The Epistles and Gospels were published in that language by Ambroise de Montefin in 1512; the whole Bible by Ca\u00f1iodore de Reyna, a Calvinist, in 1569; and the New Testament,\ndedicated to the emperor Charles V. by Francis Enzinus, otherwise called Driander, in 1543. The first Bible which was printed in Spanish for the use of the Jews, was that printed at Ferrara in 1553, in Gothic characters, and dedicated to Hercules d'Este duke of Ferrara. This version is very ancient, and was probably in use among the Jews of Spain before Ferdinand and Isabella expelled them out of their dominions in 1492.\n\n**German Bible.** The first and most ancient translation of the Bible in the German language, is that of Ulphilas bishop of the Goths, about the year 360. This bishop left out the books of Kings, which treat chiefly of war, lest it should too much encourage the martial humour of the Goths. An imperfect manuscript of this version was found in the abbey of Verden near Cologne, written in letters of silver, for which reason it is called Codex Argenteus; and it was published by Francis Junius in 1665. The oldest German printed Bible extant, is that of Nuremberg, printed in 1447; but who the author of it was, is uncertain. John Emzer, chaplain to George duke of Saxony, published a version of the New Testament in opposition to Luther. There is a German Bible of John Eckius in 1537, with Emzer's New Testament added to it; and one by Ulembergius of Westphalia, procured by Ferdinand duke of Bavaria, and printed in 1630. Martin Luther, having employed eleven years in translating the Old and New Testament, published the Pentateuch in 1522, the historical books and the Psalms in 1524, the books of Solomon in 1527, Isaiah in 1529, the Prophets in 1531, and the other books in 1530: He published the New Testament in 1522. The learned agree, that his language is pure, and the version clear, and free from intricacies: It was revised by several persons of quality, who were masters of all the delicacies of the German language. The German Bibles which have been printed in Saxony, Switzerland, and elsewhere, are for the most part the same as that of Luther, with very little variation. In 1604, John Piscator published a version of the Bible in German, taken from that of Junius and Tremellius: But his turn of expression is purely Latin, and not at all agreeable to the genius of the German language: The Anabaptists have a German Bible printed at Worms in 1529. John Crellius published his version of the New Testament at Racovia in 1630; and Felbinger his, at Amsterdam, in 1660.\n\n**Flemish Bible.** The Flemish Bibles of the Romanists are very numerous, and for the most part have no author's name prefixed to them, till that of Nicolas Vinck, printed at Lovain in 1548. The Flemish versions made use of by the Calvinists till the year 1637, were copied principally from that of Luther. But the synod of Dort having in 1618 appointed a new translation of the Bible into Flemish, deputies were named for the work, which was not finished till the year 1627.\n\n**Danish Bible.** The first Danish Bible was published by Peter Palladius, Olaus Chrysostom, John Synningius, and John Maccabaeus, in 1550, in which they followed Luther's first German version. There are two other versions, the one by John Paul Refenius bishop of Zealand, in 1605; the other, being the New Testament only, by John Michel, in 1524.\n\n**Swedish Bible.** In 1534 Olaus and Laurence published a Swedish Bible from the German version of Martin Luther. It was revised in 1617, by order of king Gustavus Adolphus, and was afterwards almost universally followed.\n\n**Bohemian, Polish, Russian or Muscovite, and Slavonian Bibles.** The Bohemians have a Bible translated by eight of their doctors, whom they had sent to the schools of Wittemberg and Basil, on purpose to study the original languages. It was printed in Moravia in the year 1539. The first Polish version of the Bible, it is said, was that composed by Hadewich wife of Jagellon, duke of Lithuania, who embraced Christianity in the year 1390. In 1599, there was a Polish translation of the Bible published at Cracow, which was the work of several Divines of that nation, and in which James Wieck, a Jesuit, had a principal share. The Protestants, in 1596, published a Polish Bible from Luther's German version, and dedicated it to Vladislav IV., king of Poland. The Russians or Muscovites published the Bible in their language in 1581. It was translated from the Greek by St Cyril, the apostle of the Slavonians; but this old version being too obscure, Ernest Gliik, who had been carried prisoner to Moscow after the taking of Narva, undertook a new translation of the Bible in the Slavonian; who dying in 1709, the Czar Peter appointed some particular divines to finish the translation: But whether it was ever printed, we cannot say.\n\n**English-Saxon, and modern English Bibles.** If we inquire into the versions of the Bible of our own country, we shall find that Adelm bishop of Sherburn, who lived in 709, made an English-Saxon version of the Psalms; and that Eadfrid, or Ecbert, bishop of Lindisfarne, who lived about the year 730, translated several of the books of scripture into the same language. It is said likewise, that venerable Bede, who died in 785, translated the whole Bible into Saxon. But Cuthbert, Bede's disciple, in the enumeration of his master's works, speaks only of his translation of the Gospel; and says nothing of the rest of the Bible. Some pretend, that king Alfred, who lived in 890, translated a great part of the scriptures. We find an old version in the Anglo-Saxon of several books of the Bible, made by Elfric abbot of Malmesbury: It was published at Oxford, in 1699. There is an old Anglo-Saxon version of the four Gospels, published by Matthew Parker, archbishop of Canterbury, in 1571, the author whereof is unknown. Dr Mill observes, that this version was made from a Latin copy of the old Vulgate.\n\nAs to the English versions of the Bible, the most ancient is that of John de Trevisa, a secular priest, who translated the Old and New Testament into English, at the request of Thomas lord Berkley: He lived in the reign of Richard II. and finished his translation in the year 1357. The second author, who undertook this work, was the famous Wickliff, who lived in the reigns of Edward III. and Richard II. The manuscript of his version is in several libraries in England. In the year 1534, an English version of the Bible, done partly by William Tindal, and partly by Miles Coverdale, was brought...\nbrought into England from Antwerp. The bishops found great fault with this translation; upon which a motion was made in convocation for an English translation of the Bible to be set up in all churches. This motion, though opposed by bishop Gardiner and his party, succeeded at last. The king gave orders for setting about it with all possible haste, and within three years the impression of it was finished. Cromwell procured a general warrant from the king, allowing all his subjects to read it; for which Cranmer wrote his thanks to Cromwell, \"rejoicing to see the work of reformation now risen in England, since the word of God did now shine over it all without a cloud.\" Cromwell likewise gave out injunctions, requiring the clergy to set up Bibles in all their churches, and to encourage the people to read them. In 1542, an act passed for restraining the use of the Bible. The preamble sets forth, that \"many feditious and ignorant people had abused the liberty granted them for reading the Bible; and that great diversity of opinions, animosities, tumults, and schisms had been occasioned by perverting the sense of the scripture. To retrieve the mischief arising from hence, it is enacted, that a certain form of orthodox doctrine be set forth, as a standard of belief; and that Tindal's false translation of the Old and New Testament be suppressed, and forbidden to be read in any of the king's dominions.\" In the reign of Edward VI, Fuller mentions another translation of the Bible, printed in two editions; the first in 1549, the other in 1551, but neither of them divided into verses.\n\nIn the reign of queen Elizabeth came out the Bishops Bible, so called, because several of that order were concerned in that version. The work was divided into several parcels, and assigned to men of learning and character. Most of the divisions are marked with great initial letters, signifying either the name or the titles of the persons employed. Archbishop Parker had the principal direction of this affair; he revised the performance, and perhaps put the finishing hand to it. He likewise employed several critics in the Hebrew and Greek languages, to review the old translation, and compare it with the original.\n\nThe last English Bible is that called King James's Bible, which proceeded from the Hampton-court conference in 1603, where many exceptions being made to the Bishops Bible, king James gave orders for a new one, not, as the preface expresses it, for a translation altogether new, nor yet to make of a bad one a good one, but to make a good one better; or of many good ones, one best. Fifty-four learned persons were appointed for this office by the king, as appears by his letter to the archbishop, dated in 1604, which being three years before the translation was entered upon, it is probable seven of them were either dead, or had declined the talk, since Fuller's list of the translators makes but forty-seven, who, being ranged under six divisions, entered on their province in 1607. It was published in 1610, with a dedication to king James, and a learned preface, and is commonly called king James's Bible. After this all other versions dropped, and fell into disuse, except the Epistles and Gospels in the Common-prayer book, which were still continued, according to the bishops translation, till the alteration of the Liturgy in 1661, and the Psalms and hymns, which are to this day continued as in the old version.\n\nThe judicious Selden, in his Table-Talk, speaking of the Bible, says, \"The English translation of the Bible is the best translation in the world, and renders the sense of the original best, taking in for the English translation the bishops Bible, as well as king James's. The translators in king James's time took an excellent way. That part of the Bible was given to him who was most excellent in such a tongue, (as the Apocrypha to Andrew Downs) and then they met together, and one read the translation, the rest holding in their hands some Bible either of the learned tongues, or French, Spanish, Italian, &c. If they found any fault, they spoke; if not, he read on.\" King James's Bible is that now read by authority in all the churches in England.\n\nIrish Bible. Towards the middle of the sixteenth century, Bedell, bishop of Kilmore, set on foot a translation of the Old Testament into the Irish language; the New Testament and the Liturgy having been before translated into that language. The bishop appointed one King to execute this work, who, not understanding the oriental languages, was obliged to translate it from the English. This work was received by Bedell, who, after having compared the Irish translation with the English, compared the latter with the Hebrew, the LXX, and the Italian version of Diodati. When this work was finished, the bishop would have been himself at the charge of the impre- sion, but his design was stopped upon advice given to the lord-lieutenant and the archbishop of Canterbury, that it would prove a shameful thing for a nation to publish a Bible translated by such a despicable hand as King. However, the manuscript was not lost, for it went to press in the year 1685.","sp":655,"ep":661},{"h":"BIBLIOTHECA","t":"in its original and proper sense, denotes a library, or place for repotting books.","sp":661,"ep":661},{"h":"BIBLIOTHECA","t":"in matters of literature, denotes a treatise, giving an account of all the writers on a certain subject: Thus, we have bibliothecas of theology, law, philosophy, &c.\n\nThere are likewise universal bibliothecas, which treat indifferently of all kinds of books; also select bibliothecas, which give an account of none but authors of reputation.","sp":661,"ep":661},{"h":"BIBLISTS","t":"so the Roman-catholics call those Christians that make scripture the sole rule of faith; in which sense, all protestants either are, or ought to be, bibli-lifts.","sp":661,"ep":661},{"h":"BIBRACH","t":"an imperial city of Swabia in Germany, about twenty miles south-west of Ulm; E. long. 9\u00b0 30', N. lat. 48\u00b0 12'.","sp":661,"ep":661},{"h":"BICANER","t":"a city of Asia, in the country of the Mogul, upon the Ganges.

But the word more commonly denotes a short obligation or mandate, by which one person obliges himself to pay a sum of money to another, or his order, against a certain time; or by which one person draws upon another for a sum payable to a third person: By this last kind of bill, money-matters are commonly transacted betwixt the inhabitants of different countries, and is called a bill of exchange: When the parties concerned live in Scotland, it is termed an inland bill.

Each bill of lading must be treble, one for the merchant who loads the goods, another to be sent to the person to whom they are consigned, and the third to remain in the hands of the master of the ship. It must be observed, however, that a bill of lading is used only when the goods, sent on board a ship, are but part of the cargo: For when a merchant loads a whole vessel for his own personal account, the deed passed between him and the master of the ship is called charter-party.

It contains the thing or fact complained of, the damage sustained, and a petition or process against the defendant for redress; and is used both in criminal and civil cases.

It comes\nfrom Frankfort, Mentz, and Strasbourg, either in\nlumps or powder, and must be chosen moist, without\nhaving been wetted, of a fine shining black, soft, fri-\nable, light, and with as few shining grains as possible.\n\nIvory Black, otherwise called velvet black, is burnt\nivory, which becoming quite black, and being reduced\nto thin plates, is ground in water, and made into tro-\nches, to be used by painters, and by jewellers, who\nset precious stones, to blacken the ground of the col-\nlets, and give the diamonds a teint or foil. In order\nto be good, it ought to be tender, friable, and tho-\nroughly ground.\n\nBone-Black is made with the bones of oxen, cows, &c.\nand is used in painting; but is not so much esteemed as\nivory black.\n\nHart's-Black, that which remains in the retort after\nthe spirits, volatile salt, and oil, have been extracted\nfrom hart's-horn.

Steeping is the first operation which the cloth undergoes, and is performed in this manner. The linens are folded up, each piece distinct, and laid in a large wooden vessel; into which is thrown, blood-warm, a sufficient quantity of water, or equal parts of water and lye, which has been used to white cloth only, or water with rye-meal or bran mixed with it, till the whole is thoroughly wet, and the liquor rises over all. Then a cover of wood is laid over the cloth, and that cover is secured with a polt betwixt the boards and the joistling, to prevent the cloth from rising during the fermentation which ensues. About six hours after the cloth has been steeped in warm water, and about twelve in cold, bubbles of air arise, a pellicle is formed on the surface of the liquor, and the cloth swells when it is not pressed down. This intestine motion continues from thirty-six to forty-eight hours, according to the warmth of the weather; about which time the pellicle or foam begins to fall to the bottom. Before this precipitation happens, the cloth must be taken out; and the proper time for taking it out, is when no more air-bubbles arise. This is allowed to be the justest guide by the most experienced bleachers.\n\nThe cloth is then taken out, well rinsed, disposed regularly by the selvage, and washed in the put-mill to carry off the loose dust. After this it is spread on the field to dry. When thoroughly dried, it is ready for bucking; which is the second operation.\n\nBucking, or the application of salts, is performed in this manner. The first, or mother lye, is made in a copper, which we shall suppose, for example, when full, holds 170 Scots gallons of water. The copper is filled three fourths full of water, which is brought to boil: just when it begins, the following proportion of ashes is put into it, viz. 30 lb. of blue, and as much white pearl-ashes; 200 lb. of Malcoit ashes, (or, if they have not these, about 300 lb. of Calshub); 300 lb. of Mufcovy, or blanch ashes; the three last ought to be well pounded.\n\nThis liquor is allowed to boil for a quarter of an hour, stirring the ashes from the bottom very often; after which the fire is taken away. The liquor must stand till it has settled, which takes at least six hours, and then it is fit for use.\n\nOut of their first, or mother-lye, the second, or that used in bucking, is made in this manner. Into another copper, holding, for example, 40 Scots gallons, are put 38 gallons of water, 2 lb. soft soap, and 2 gallons of mother-lye; or, for cheapness, in place of the soap, when they have lye which has been used to white linen, called white-linen lye, they take 14 gallons of it, leaving out an equal quantity of water. This is called bucking-lye.\n\nAfter the linens are taken up from the field dry, they are set in the vat or cave, as their large vessel is called, in rows, endwife, that they may be equally wet by the lye; which, made blood-warm, is now thrown on them, and the cloth is afterwards squeezed down by a man with wooden shoes. Each row undergoes the same operation, until the vessel is full, or all the cloth in it. At first the lye is put on milk-warm, and, after standing a little time on the cloth, it is again let off by a cock into the bucking-copper, heated to a greater degree, and then put on the cloth again. This course is repeated for six or seven hours, and the degree of heat gradually increased, till it is, at the last turn or two, thrown on boiling hot. The cloth remains after this for three or four hours in the lye; after which the lye is let off, thrown away, or used in the first buckings, and the cloth goes on to another operation.\n\nIt is then carried out, generally early in the morning, spread on the grass, pinned, corded down, exposed to the sun and air, and watered for the first six hours, so often, that it never is allowed to dry. Afterwards it is allowed to lie till dry spots appear before it is watered. After seven at night it gets no more water, unless it be a very dry night. Next day, in the morning and forenoon, it is watered twice or thrice if the day be very dry; but if the weather be not drying, it gets no water: After which it is taken up dry if the green be clean; if not, it is rinsed, mill-washed, and laid out to dry again, to become fit for bucking.\nThis alternate course of bucking and watering, is performed for the most part, from ten to sixteen times, or more, before the linen is fit for souring; gradually increasing the strength of the lye from the first to the middle bucking, and from that gradually decreasing it till the souring begins. The lyes in the middle buckings are generally about a third stronger than the first and last.\n\nSouring, or the application of acids to cloth, is the fourth operation. It is difficult to say when this operation should commence, and depends mostly on the skill and experience of the bleacher. When the cloth has an equal colour, and is mostly freed from the sprat, or outer bark of the lint, it is then thought fit for souring; which is performed in the following manner. Into a large vat or vessel is powered such a quantity of buttermilk, or sour milk, as will sufficiently wet the first row of cloth; which is tied up in loose folds, and pressed down by two or three men bare-footed. If the milk is thick, about an eighth of water is added to it; if thin, no water. Sours made with bran, or rye-meal and water, are often used instead of milk, and used milk-warm. Over the first row of cloth a quantity of milk and water is thrown, to be imbibed by the second; and so it is continued till the linen to be soured is sufficiently wet, and the liquor rises over the whole. The cloth is then kept down by covers filled with holes, and secured with a post fixed to the joist, that it may not rise. Some hours after the cloth has been in the four, air-bubbles arise, a white scum is found on the surface, and an intestine motion goes on in the liquor. In warm weather it appears sooner, is stronger, and ends sooner, than in cold weather. Just before this fermentation, which lasts five or six days, is finished, at which time the scum falls down, the cloth should be taken out, rinsed, mill-washed, and delivered to the women to be washed with soap and water.\n\nWashing with soap and water, is the fifth operation; and is performed thus. Two women are placed opposite at each tub, which is made of very thick staves, so that the edges, which slope inwards, are about four inches in thickness. A small vessel full of warm water is placed in each tub. The cloth is folded so that the selvage may be first rubbed with soap and warm water lengthways, till it is sufficiently impregnated with it. In this manner all the parcel is rubbed with soap, and afterwards carried to be bucked.\n\nThe lye now used has no soap in it, except what it gets from the cloth; and is equal in strength to the strongest formerly used, or rather stronger, because the cloth is now put in wet. From the former operation these lyes are gradually made stronger, till the cloth seems of an uniform white, nor any darkness or brown colour appears in its ground. After this the lye is more speedily weakened than it was increased; so that the last which the cloth gets, is weaker than any it got before.\n\nBut the management of fours is different; for they are used strongest at first, and decreased so in strength, that the last four, considering the cloth is then always taken up wet, may be reckoned to contain three fourths of water.\n\nFrom the bucking it goes to the watering, as formerly, observing only to overlap the selvages, and tie it down with cords, that it may not tear; then it returns to the four, milling, washing, bucking, and watering again. These operations succeed one another alternately till the cloth is whitened; at which time it is blued, starched, and dried.\n\nThis is the method used in the whitening fine cloths. The following is the method used in the whitening of coarse cloths.\n\nHaving sorted the cloths, according to their quality, they are steeped in the same manner as the fine, rinsed, washed in the mill, and dried before boiling.\n\nIn this process, boiling supplies the place of bucking, as it takes less time, and consequently is thought cheaper. It is done in the following manner: 200 lb. caustic ashes, 100 lb. white Mucovia, and 30 lb. pearl-ashes, boiled in 105 Scots gallons of water for a quarter of an hour, as in the process for the fine cloth, makes the mother or first lye. The cloth-boiler is then to be filled two thirds full with water and mother-lye, about nine parts of the former to one of the latter; so that the lye used for boiling the coarse cloth, is about a third weaker than that used in bucking the fine. Such a quantity of cloth is put into the foregoing quantity of lye, when cold, as can be well covered by it. The lye is brought gradually to the boil, and kept boiling for two hours; the cloth being fixed down all the time, that it does not rise above the liquor. The cloth is then taken out, spread on the field, and watered, as mentioned before in the fine cloth.\n\nAs the salts of the lye are not exhausted by this boiling, the same is continued to be used all that day, adding, at each boiling, so much of the mother-lye as will bring it to the same strength as at first. The lye by boiling loses in quantity somewhat betwixt a third and a fourth; and they reckon that in strength it loses about a half, because they find in practice, that adding to it half its former strength in fresh lye, has the same effect on cloth. Therefore some fresh lye, containing a fourth part of the water, and the half of the strength of the first lye, makes the second boiler equal in strength to the first. To the third boiler they add somewhat more than the former proportion, and go on still increasing gradually to the fourth and fifth, which is as much as can be done in a day. The boiler is then cleaned, and next day they begin with fresh lye. These additions of fresh lye ought always to be made by the master-bleacher, as it requires judgment to bring succeeding lyes to the same strength as the first.\n\nWhen the cloth comes to get the second boiling, the lye should be a little stronger, about a thirtieth part, and the deficiencies made up in the same proportion. For six or seven boilings, or fewer, if the cloth be thin, the lye is increased in this way, and then gradually diminished till the cloth is fit for souring. The whitest cloth ought always to be boiled first, that it may not be hurt by what goes before.\n\nIn this process, if the cloth cannot be got dry for boiling, business does not stop as in the fine; for after the\ncoarse has crept on racks made for the purpose, it is boiled, making the lye strong in proportion to the water in the cloth.\n\nThe common method of souring coarse linen is, to mix some warm water and bran in the vat, then put a layer of cloth, then more bran, water, and cloth; and so on, till the cave is full. The whole is tramped with men's feet, and fixed as in the former process. A thousand yards of cloth, yard-broad, require between four and six pecks of bran. The cloth generally lies about three nights and two days in the sour. Others prepare their four twenty-four hours before, by mixing the bran with warm water in a separate vessel; and before pouring it on the cloth, they dilute it with a sufficient quantity of water. After the cloth is taken from the sour, it ought to be well washed and rinsed again. It is then given to men to be well soaked on a table, and afterwards rubbed between the rubbing-boards. When it comes from them, it should be well milled, and warm water poured on it all the time, if convenience will allow of it. Two or three of these rubbings are sufficient, and the cloth very seldom requires more.\n\nThe lye, after the souring begins, is decreased in strength by degrees; and three boilings after that are commonly sufficient to finish the cloth. Afterwards it is starched, blued, dried, and bitted in a machine made for that purpose, which supplies the place of a calendar, and is preferred by many to it.\n\nThis method used in the bleaching of our coarse cloths, is very like that practised in Ireland for both fine and coarse. The only material difference is, that there the bleachers use no other ashes but the kelp or cahub. A lye is drawn from the former by cold water, which dissolves the salts, and not the sulphureous particles of the kelp ashes. This lye is used till the cloth is half whitened, and then they lay aside the kelp-lye for one made of cahub ashes.\n\nIn the preceding history of bleaching we may observe, that it naturally divides itself into several different branches or parts, all tending to give linen the degree of whiteness required. How they effectuate that comes next to be considered.\n\nThe general process of bleaching divides itself into these different parts. 1. Steeping and milling. 2. Bucking and boiling. 3. Alternate watering and drying. 4. Souring. 5. Rubbing with soap and warm water, starching, and bluing. We shall treat of these different parts in their order.\n\n**Steeping.**\n\nGreen linen, in the different changes which it has undergone before it arrives at that state, contracts a great foulness. This is chiefly communicated to it by the dressing composed of tallow and fowen, which is a kind of flummery made of bran, flour, or oat-meal feeds. The first thing to be done in the bleachfield is to take off all that filth which is foreign to the flax, would blunt the future action of the salts, and might, in unskilful hands, be fixed in the cloth. This is the design of steeping.\n\nTo accomplish this end, the cloth is laid to steep in blood-warm water. A smaller degree of heat would not dissolve the dressing so soon; and the greater might coagulate and fix, in the body of the linen, those particles which we design to carry off. In a few hours the dressing made use in weaving is dissolved, mixed with the water; and, as it had acquired some degree of acidity, before application, it becomes a species of ferment. Each ferment promotes its own particular species of fermentation, or intestine motion; the putrid ferment sets in motion the putrefactive fermentation; the vinous ferment gives rise to the vinous fermentation; and the acid ferment to the acetous fermentation. That there is a real fermentation going on in steeping, one must be soon convinced, who attends to the air-bubbles which immediately begin to arise, to the scum which gathers on the surface; and to the intestine motion and swelling of the whole liquor. That it must be the acetous fermentation, appears from this, that the vegetable particles, already in part fouled, must first undergo this process.\n\nThe effect of all fermentations is to set the liquor in motion; to raise in it a degree of heat; and to emit air-bubbles, which, by carrying up some of the light oleaginous particles along with them, produce a scum. But as the dressing is in small quantity in proportion to the water, these effects are gentle and slow. The acid salts are no sooner separated, by the acetous fermentation, from the absorbent earth, which made them not perceptible to the tongue in their former state, than they are united to the oily particles of the tallow, which likewise adhere superficially, dissolve them, and render them, in some degree, miscible with water. In this state they are soon washed off by the intestine motion of the liquor. The consequence of this operation is, that the cloth comes out freed in a great measure from its superficial dirt; and more pliant and soft than what it was.\n\nWhenever this intestine motion is pretty much abated, and before the scum subsides, bleachers take out their cloth. The scum, when no more air-bubbles rise to support it, separates, and falls down; and would again communicate to the cloth great part of the filth. But a longer stay would be attended with a much greater disadvantage. The putrid follows close upon the acetous fermentation: When the latter ends, the former begins. Were this to take place, in any considerable degree, it would render the cloth black and tender. Bleachers cannot be too careful in this article.\n\nThe first question that arises to be determined on these principles is, What is the properest liquor for steeping cloth? Those used by bleachers are plain water; white-linen lye and water, equal parts; and rye-meal or bran mixed with water. They always make use of lye when they have it.\n\nAfter steeping, the cloth is carried to the puddle-mill, to be freed of all its loose foulness. There can be nothing contrived so effectual to answer the purpose as this mill. Its motion is easy, regular, and safe. While it presses gently, it turns the cloth; which is continually washed with a stream of water. Care must be taken that no water be detained in the folds of the linen, otherwise that part may be damaged.\n\n**BUCKING**","sp":669,"ep":671},{"h":"BLEAK","t":"the English name of the fish called cyprinus.

The species are ten, viz. 1. The contortrix, has 150 scuta on the belly, and 40 on the tail; the head is broad, very convex, and has poison-bags in the mouth, but no fang, for which reason its bite is not reckoned poisonous: The body is ash-coloured, interspersed with large dusky spots; and the tail is about a third of the length of the body. This serpent is found in Carolina. 2. The canina, has 203 scuta on the belly, and 77 on the tail; it is greenish, and variegated with white belts. It is a native of America, and lodges in the hollow-trunks of trees, and is about two feet long. The bite of the canina is not poisonous. 3. The hipnale, is of a dull yellow colour, and is found in Asia. It has 179 scuta on the belly, and 120 on the tail.\u20144. The constrictor, has 240 scuta on the belly, and 60 on the tail. This is an immense animal; it often exceeds 36 feet in length; the body is very thick, of a dusky white colour, and its back is interspersed with 24 large pale irregular spots; the tail is of a darker colour; and the sides are beautifully variegated with pale spots. Besides, the whole body is interspersed with small brown spots. The head is covered with small scales, and has no broad lamina betwixt the eyes, but has a black belt behind the eyes. It wants the large dog-fangs, and of course its bite is not poisonous. The tongue is fleshy, and very little forked. Above the eyes, on each side, the head rises high. The scales of this serpent are all very small, roundish, and smooth. The tail does not exceed one eighth of the whole length of the animal. The Indians, who adore this monstrous animal, use the skin for cloaths, on account of its smoothness and beauty. There are several of these skins of the above dimensions preserved, and to be seen in the different museums.\nseums of Europe, particularly in the library and botanic garden of Upsal in Sweden, which has of late been greatly enriched by count Grillinborg. The flesh of this serpent is eaten by the Indians, and the negroes of Africa. Pifo, Margraave, and Kempfer give the following account of its method of living and catching its prey. It frequents caves and thick forests, where it conceals itself, and suddenly darts out upon travellers, wild beasts, &c. When it chuses a tree for its watching-place, it supports itself by twisting its tail around the trunk or a branch, and darts down upon sheep, goats, tigers, or any animal that comes within its reach. When it lays hold of animals, especially any of the larger kinds, it twists itself several times round their body, and, by the vast force of its circular muscles, bruises and breaks all their bones. After the bones are broke, it licks the skin of the animal all over, besmearing it with a glutinous kind of saliva. This operation is intended to facilitate deglutition, and is a preparation for swallowing the whole animal. If it be a stag, or any horned animal, it begins to swallow the feet first, and gradually sucks in the body, and last of all the head. When the horns happen to be large, this serpent has been observed to go about for a long time with the horns of a stag sticking out from its mouth. As the animal digests, the horns putrify and fall off. After this serpent has swallowed a stag or a tyger, it is unable for some days to move; the hunters, who are well acquainted with this circumstance, always take this opportunity of destroying it. When irritated, it makes a loud hissing noise. This serpent is said to cover itself over with leaves in such places as stags or other animals frequent, in order to conceal itself from their sight, and that it may the more easily lay hold of them. See Plate LII. fig. 1.\u20145. The murina, has 254 scuta on the belly, and 65 on the tail. The colour of it is a light blue, with round spots on the back. It is a native of America, and its bite is not poisonous. 6. The scytale, has 250 scuta on the belly, and 70 on the tail. The body is ash-coloured and bluish, with round black spots on the back, and black lateral rings edged with white. This serpent is a native of America; and, like the constrictor, though not so long, twists itself about sheep, goats, &c., and swallows them whole. 7. The cenchrus, has 265 scuta on the belly, and 57 on the tail. It is of a yellow colour, with white eye-like spots. It is a native of Surinam, and its bite is not poisonous. 8. The ophrias, has 281 scuta on the belly, and 64 on the tail; the colour is nearly the same with that of the constrictor, but browner. The place where this serpent is to be found is not known; but its bite is not venomous. 9. The enydris, has 270 scuta on the belly, and 105 on the tail. The colour is a dusky white, and the teeth of the lower jaw are very long; but its bite is not poisonous. It is a native of America. 10. The hortulana, has 290 scuta on the belly, and 128 on the tail. It is of a pale colour, interspersed with livid wedge-like spots.

See Character.\n\nOf profane books, the oldest extant are Homer's poems, which were so even in the time of Sextus Empiricus; though we find mention in Greek writers of seventy others prior to Homer; as Hermes, Orpheus, Daphne, Horus, Linus, Mufcus, Palamedes, Zoroaster, &c.; but of the greater part of these there is not the least fragment remaining; and of others, the pieces which go under their names are generally held, by the learned, to be supposititious.\n\nSeveral sorts of materials were used formerly in making\nmaking books: Plates of lead and copper, the barks of trees, bricks, stone, and wood, were the first materials employed to engrave such things upon as men were willing to have transmitted to posterity. Josephus speaks of two columns, the one of stone, the other of brick, on which the children of Seth wrote their inventions and astronomical discoveries: Porphyry makes mention of some pillars, preserved in Crete, on which the ceremonies practised by the Corybantes in their sacrifices were recorded. Hesiod's works were originally written upon tables of lead, and deposited in the temple of the Muses, in Boeotia: The ten commandments, delivered to Moses, were written upon stone; and Solon's laws upon wooden planks. Tables of wood, box, and ivory, were common among the ancients: When of wood, they were frequently covered with wax, that people might write on them with more ease, or blot out what they had written. The leaves of the palm-tree were afterwards used instead of wooden planks, and the finest and thinnest part of the bark of such trees, as the lime, the ash, the mapple, and the elm; from hence comes the word liber, which signifies the inner bark of the trees: and these barks were rolled up, in order to be removed with greater ease, these rolls were called volumen, a volume; a name afterwards given to the like rolls of paper or parchment.\n\nThus we find books were first written on stones, witness the Decalogue given to Moses: Then on the parts of plants, as leaves chiefly of the palm-tree; the rind and barks, especially of the tilia, or phillyrea, and the Egyptian papyrus. By degrees wax, then leather, were introduced, especially the skins of goats and sheep, of which at length parchment was prepared: Then lead came into use; also linen, silk, horn, and lastly paper itself.\n\nThe first books were in the form of blocks and tables; but as flexible matter came to be wrote on, they found it more convenient to make their books in the form of rolls: These were composed of several sheets, fastened to each other, and rolled upon a stick, or umbilicus; the whole making a kind of column, or cylinder, which was to be managed by the umbilicus as a handle, it being reputed a crime to take hold of the roll itself: The outside of the volume was called frons; the ends of the umbilicus, cornua, which were usually carved, and adorned with silver, ivory, or even gold and precious stones: The title \u03c3\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03ae\u03c2, was struck on the outside; the whole volume, when extended, might make a yard and a half wide, and fifty long. The form which obtains among us is the square, composed of separate leaves; which was also known, though little used, by the ancients.\n\nTo the form of books belongs also the internal economy, as the order and arrangements of points and letters into lines and pages, with margins and other appurtenants: This has undergone many varieties; at first the letters were only divided into lines, then into separate words, which, by degrees, were noted with accents, and distributed, by points and stops, into periods, paragraphs, chapters, and other divisions. In some countries, as among the orientals, the lines began from the right and ran leftward; in others, as the northern and western nations, from left to right; others, as the Greeks, followed both directions, alternately going in the one, and returning in the other, called boukropbedon: In most countries, the lines run from one side to the other; in some, particularly the Chinese, from top to bottom. See Composition.\n\nBOOK-KEEPING\n\nBOOK-KEEPING is an art, teaching how to record and dispose the accounts of business, so as the true state of every part, and of the whole, may be easily and distinctly known.\n\nThough the number and kinds of books used in this art be in some measure arbitrary, there are three which can never be dispensed with by those whose trade is complex or extensive, viz. the Waste-book, Journal, and Ledger.\n\nI. Of the Waste-book.\n\nThe Waste-book is a register, containing an inventory of a merchant's effects and debts, with a record of all his transactions, narrated in a plain, simple style, and in the exact order of time as they succeed one another.\n\nThe Waste-book opens with the inventory; which consists of two parts: First, the effects, that is, the money a merchant has by him, the goods he has on hand, his share in ships, houses, farms, &c., with the debts due to him; the second part of the inventory is the debts due by him to others: The difference betwixt which and the effects, is what merchants call neat stock. When a man begins trade, the inventory must be gathered from a survey of the particulars that make up his real estate; but must afterwards be collected from the balance of his old books, and carried to the new. This inventory is the first thing narrated in the Waste-book, as being the source and spring whence all subsequent transactions flow.\n\nAfter the inventory is fairly narrated in the Waste-book, the transactions of trade come next to be jotted down;\ndown; which is a daily task, to be performed as they occur; and should be done distinctly, that is, every thing should be clearly and exactly expressed.\n\nIf no subsidiary books are kept, the Waste-book should contain a record of all the merchant's transactions and dealings in a way of trade; and that not only of such as are properly and purely mercantile, but of every occurrence that affects his stock, so as to impair or increase it; such as, private expenses, servants fees, house-rents, money gained or lost on wagers; legacies, and the like. By such occurrences as these, a merchant as effectually becomes so much poorer or richer, as by the result of any branch of his trade. And the ends proposed in book-keeping can never be gained, if such things pass unrecorded.\n\nII. Of the Journal.\n\nThe Journal is the book wherein the transactions recorded in the Waste-book are prepared to be carried to the Ledger, by having their proper debtors and creditors ascertained and pointed out.\n\nOne great design of the Journal is, to prevent errors in the Ledger; a thing of the worst consequence in book-keeping; which yet, without the help of this book, would be almost inevitable. For, suppose a person should attempt to form the Debtors and Creditors from the Waste-book in his mind, and at the same time post them to the Ledger, he shall find his thoughts so much embarrassed and over-charged, by attending at once to so many different things as occur here, that, were he an accountant of very great experience, he could not well miss of falling into frequent blunders. This makes it necessary to divide the task, and do at twice what cannot be performed at once, without such hazard of mistakes; that is, first to write out the Debtors and Creditors in a separate book by themselves, and afterward transfer them to the Ledger. The work by this means being divided into parts, becomes more simple, and consequently more easy, and so may be performed with greater certainty of its being right. Again, after the Ledger is filled up, the Journal facilitates the work required in revising and correcting it; for, first the Waste-book and Journal are compared, and then the Journal and Ledger. Whereas, to revise and correct the Ledger immediately from the Waste-book, would be a matter of no less difficulty than to form it without the help of a Journal. Lastly, The Journal is designed as a fair record of a merchant's business: For neither of the other two books can serve this purpose; nor the Ledger, by reason both of the order that obtains in it, and also on account of its brevity, being little more than a large Index. Nor can the Waste-book answer this design; for being written up in the time of business, and commonly too by different hands, it can neither be fair and uniform, nor very accurate.\n\nThe Journal is a kind of middle book between the other two; it looks back to the one, and forward to the other. With the Waste-book it agrees in form, being ruled after the same manner. The order also and succession of things is the same in both. The thing then that distinguishes the two books is the style; that of the one being natural, and that of the other artificial. In the Journal, persons and things are charged Debtors to other persons or things as Creditors; and in this it agrees with the Ledger, where the same style is used, but differs from it as to form and order: So that it agrees with the Waste-book in those very things wherein it differs from the Ledger; and on the other hand, it agrees with the latter in that very point wherein it differs from the former.\n\nBut an example of the Waste-book turned into the Journal form, will give a clearer idea than can be conveyed by words.\n\n### WASTE-BOOK\n\n| Date | Description | Amount |\n|------|-------------|--------|\n| July 1st | Bought 40 yards black cloth, at 14s. | 280000 |\n|       | Bought of James Sloan, 100 yards shalloon at 10d. |        |\n|       | Whereof paid | 20000 |\n|       | Rest due at two months | 20304 |\n\n| Date | Description | Amount |\n|------|-------------|--------|\n|      | Sold William Pope 4 pipes Port-wine, at 27l. 10s. |        |\n|      | Whereof received | 55000 |\n|      | Rest due on demand | 55000 |\n\n### JOURNAL\n\n| Date | Description | Amount |\n|------|-------------|--------|\n| July 1st | Black Cloth Dr to Cash 28l. |        |\n|       | Paid for 40 yards, at 14s. | 280000 |\n|       | Shalloon Dr to Sundries 434l. |        |\n|       | To Cash, in part for 100 yards, at 10d. | 20000 |\n|       | To J.

Pope, for the rest on demand | 55000 |\n\nBefore proceeding to give rules for writing in the Journal, it will be necessary to take notice, that every case or example of the Waste-book, when entered in the Journal, is called a Journal post or entry: Thus the examples above make up three distinct posts. Again, a post is either simple or complex. A simple post is that which has...\nhas but one Debtor and one Creditor, as the first of these above. A complex post is either when one Debtor is balanced by two or more Creditors, as in the second post; or when two or more Debtors are balanced by one Creditor, as in the third post; or when several Debtors are balanced by several Creditors, and then the post is said to be complex in both its terms. This being premised, the rules to be observed are these following.\n\nI. In a simple post, the debtor is to be expressly mentioned, then the creditor, and, lastly, the sum, all in one line: After which follows the narrative, or reason of the entry, in one or more lines, as in the first of these three posts above.\n\nII. In a complex post, the several Debtors or Creditors are expressed in the first line, by Sundries, or Sundry Accoupts, and the rest of the line filled up as in the former rule. After which, the several Debtors or Creditors must be particularly mentioned, each in a line by themselves, with their respective sums subjoined to them; which are to be added up, and their total carried to the money-columns, as in the second and third posts.\n\nThe Journal, as described and exemplified above, is the form that was first in use among merchants; and is still the most common: but some make their Journal just a fair copy of the Waste-book, with the Debtors and Creditors written out on the margin, which is ruled large for that purpose. We shall here subjoin the three preceding posts done after this way; which, to one who understands the common method, will be sufficient instruction.\n\n| Dr Black Cloth, | l. s. d. |\n|-----------------|---------|\n| Cr Cash,        | 28 00 00 |\n\n| Crs Cash,       | 2 00 00 |\n| J.

Accoupts in the Ledger consist of two parts, which in their own nature are directly opposed to, and the reverse of one another; which therefore are set facing one another, on opposite sides of the same folio. Thus, all the articles of money received go to the left side of the Cash-account, and all the articles or sums laid out are carried to the right. In like manner, the purchase of goods is posted to the left side of the account of the said goods, and the sale, or disposal of them, to the right, &c.\n\nII. Transactions of trade, or cases of the Waste-book, are also made up of two parts, which belong to different accounts, and to opposite sides of the Ledger: e.g. If goods are bought for ready money, the two parts are, the goods received, and the money delivered; the former of which goes to the left side of the account of said goods, and the latter to the right side of the Cash-account.\n\nIII. These two different parts, in cases of the Waste-book, are not opposed to one another, as the two sides of the Ledger-accounts are; but, on the contrary, have a mutual connection and dependence, the one being the ground, condition, or cause of the other. Thus, in the preceding example, when goods are bought for ready money, the receipt of the goods is the cause of parting with the money; and, on the other hand, the delivering of the money is the condition on which the goods are received.\n\nFrom these three observations, it is plain, that, in order to post a case of the Waste-book to the Ledger, the first thing the accountant must do, is, to divide the case into its parts, and then to think with himself, to which account, and to what side, each of these parts is to be carried; and when the entry is actually made, the connection of the parts with one another must be expressed in each of the accounts to which they are transported. Now, since in speaking and writing things must have names whereby they may be expressed and written, it is necessary that two words or terms be contrived, and appropriated to these two different parts, that have the same relation to one another as the parts themselves have, which may at once characterize and distinguish the parts from one another, point out and ascertain to what side of the Ledger each of them is to be carried, and withal express their relation to, and dependence upon one another.\n\nThe Italians at first for this purpose pitched upon the terms\nterms Debtor and Creditor, because their common acception comes nearer to the thing here meant than any other they could think on. By means of these terms, the two parts, in any case of the Waste-book, when posted to the Journal, are denominated, the one the Debtor, and the other the Creditor, of that post. And when carried from thence to the Ledger, the Debtor, or Debtor part, is entered upon the left side (hence called the Debtor side) of its own account, where it is charged Debtor to the Creditor part. Again, the Creditor, or Creditor part, is posted to the right side, or Creditor-side of its account, and made Creditor by the Debtor part. Hence Italian book-keeping is said to be a method of keeping accounts by double entry, because every single case of the Waste-book requires at least two entries in the Ledger, viz., one for the Debtor, and another for the Creditor.\n\nWe shall illustrate what has been said by two examples. First, suppose a merchant buys a pipe of wine for ready money, the two parts in this case are, the wine received, and the money delivered for it, which are characterized by the terms Debtor and Creditor in the Journal; put thus: Wine Dr to Cash, where the meaning is, (though to express it so is needless), that as Wine is Dr to Cash, so Cash is Cr by Wine. And accordingly when carried to the Ledger, the Wine-account is charged Dr to Cash, and the Cash-account is made Cr by Wine. Again, 2dly, Admit the merchant sells this pipe of wine for present money, in this case the two parts are the same as before; but when clothed with Debtor and Creditor, will stand inverted thus: Cash Dr to Wine. And accordingly, in the Ledger, the Cash-account is charged Dr to Wine, and the Wine-account gets credit by Cash. From all which it is evident, the terms Debtor and Creditor are nothing else but marks or characteristics stamped upon the different parts of transactions in the Journal, expressing the relation of these parts to one another, and shewing to which side of their respective accounts in the Ledger they are to be carried.\n\nRules relating to Debtor and Creditor.\n\nI. A thing received upon trust, is Dr to the person of whom it is received.\n\nII. The person to whom a thing is delivered upon trust, is Dr to the thing delivered.\n\nIII. A thing received, is Dr to the thing given for it.\n\nIV. In antecedent and subsequent cases, parts that are the reverse of one another in the nature of the thing, are also opposed in respect of terms.\n\nV. In cases where personal and real Drs or Crs are wanting, the defect must be supplied by fictitious ones.\n\nVI. In complex cases, the sundry Drs or Crs are to be made out from the preceding rules jointly taken.\n\nWe now proceed to the particular application of Debtor and Creditor in the several branches of trade, viz:\n\n1. Proper trade, which a merchant carries on for himself.\n\nII. Factorage, which he manages for another, called his Employer.\n\nIII. Partnership, which is carried on by a trustee, in name of all the partners.\n\nI. IN PROPER TRADE.\n\nProper trade is either domestic or foreign. Proper domestic trade, is that which a merchant carries on by himself, without the help of a factor. Proper foreign trade, is the business that occurs to a merchant by employing a factor.\n\n1/3, Debtor and Creditor applied in proper domestic trade.\n\nProper domestic trade comprehends the inventory, buying, selling, bartering, receiving money, and paying money. To each of these we shall assign a distinct problem; and, to prevent burdening the learner's memory, we shall deliver the several cases as comprehensively as possible, subjoining to each problem such notes as seem necessary for clearing any thing that requires further illustration.\n\nN.B. As we refer from the cases and notes of each problem, to the example of Domestic trade, by the cases, so we have made the letters and numbers, as references from them to the cases and notes of the problems which the reader will easily observe.\n\nProb. 1. A. Debtor and Creditor applied to the inventory.\n\nThe inventory consists of two parts, and accordingly is journalized at twice, viz. 1. Sundries Drs to Stock. The several Drs are, Cash, for the merchant's ready money; Goods on hand, for their respective values; Persons, for their debts due to him. 2. Stock Dr to Sundries. The several Crs are, the persons to whom the merchant owes. Compare the Waste-book and Journal.\n\nJan. 1\n\nNote: Stock is a fictitious term used instead of the merchant's name.\n\nProb. 2. B. Debtor and Creditor applied in buying.\n\nIn buying one single commodity there are seven distinct cases, (viz. three simple, and four complex): in all which the goods bought and received are Dr; but the Cr varies according to the terms of purchase.\n\nCase 1. When goods are bought for ready money, the entry is, Goods bought Dr to Cash. Jan. 6.\n\n2. When goods are bought, and paid for by giving the seller a bill or note upon a third person, Goods bought Dr to the Acceptor, viz. the said third person.\n\n3. When goods are bought on time, Goods bought Dr to the Seller. Jan. 10. Oct. 21.\n\n4. When goods are bought for part money, part bill. Goods bought Dr to Sundries, viz.\n\nTo Cash, for the sum paid,\n\nTo Acceptor, for value of the bill.\n\n5. When goods are bought for part money, part on time. Goods bought Dr to Sundries, viz.\n\nTo Cash, paid in part,\n\nTo Seller, for the rest. Jan. 15.\n\n6. When goods are bought for part bill, part time. Goods bought Dr to Sundries, viz.\n\nTo Acceptor, for value of the bill,\n\nTo Seller, for the rest.\n\n7. When goods are bought for part money, part bill, part time. Goods bought Dr to Sundries, viz.\n\nTo Cash, for the sum paid,\nTo Acceptor, for value of the bill,\nTo Seller, for the rest. Feb. 2.\n\nNote 1. When two or more kinds of goods are bought from one person at the same time, there will be two or more Drs, viz., the several kinds of goods bought, each for their respective values; but the various rates will occur here as when one single commodity is bought; so that if the former goods be bought for ready money, or on bill, or on note, the entry will be\u2014\n\nSundries Drs, To Cash, if bought for ready money. Feb. 16.\n\nBut if the sundry goods are bought for part money, part bill, or for part money, part time, or for part bill, part time, &c., it is best to resolve the case into two entries, viz., first charge the Goods Dr to the Seller, for their full value, as if they had been bought at once; and then make the Seller Dr to Cash, or to Accepter, or to Seller, as a matter of course, for the balance due. Thus, suppose the goods are bought for part money, part bill, part time, the two entries will be\u2014\n\n1. Sundries Dr to Sundries, viz.\n2. Seller Dr to Sundries, viz.\n\nProb. 3. C. Debtor and Creditor applied in selling.\n\nSelling is just the reverse of buying, and has the same variety of cases, viz., seven; whereof three are simple, and four complex: in all which, the goods sold and delivered are Cr; but the Dr varies according to the conditions of sale.\n\nCase 1. When goods are sold for ready money, the entry is, Cash Dr to Goods sold. Feb. 25.\n\n2. When goods are sold on bill or note, Accepter Dr to Goods sold. March 17. See Note 7.\n\n3. When goods are sold on time, Buyer Dr to Goods sold. March 1.\n\n4. When goods are sold for part money, part bill, Sundries Drs to Goods sold, viz.\n\nCash, for the sum received,\nAccepter, for value of the bill. March 22.\n\n5. When goods are sold for part money, part on time, Sundries Drs to Goods sold, viz.\n\nCash, received in part,\nBuyer, for the rest. March 4.\n\n6. When goods are sold for part bill, part time, Sundries Drs to Goods sold, viz.\n\nAccepter, for value of the bill,\nBuyer, for the rest.\n\n7. When goods are sold for part money, part bill, part time, Sundries Drs to Goods sold, viz.\n\nCash, for the sum received,\nAccepter, for value of the bill,\nBuyer, for the rest.\n\nNote 1. Thus the entries in buying and selling one single commodity are just the reverse of one another; and this also holds in buying and selling two or more kinds of goods, which shall therefore pass, referring the learner to \"the rules for buying\" and preceding.\n\nNote 2. If the goods are to be delivered, not presently, but some time afterward, and receive money for advance, charge Cash Dr to the Buyer, for the sum received; and when you deliver the goods, make the Buyer Dr to Goods, for the full amount due. But if, upon delivery of them, you immediately receive the part of their price, enter Sundries (viz., the Buyer, for the sum received for advance, and Cash, for the sum now received) Drs to the Goods delivered. If you find you cannot perform the bargain, and be obli-\n\nged to return the money advanced, and pay the penalty, make Sundries (viz., the Buyer, for the full advanced, and Profit and Loss, or Refusal of bargain, for the penalty) Drs to Cash now paid.\n\nNote 3. If you sell a ship, house, &c., enter Cash, or the Buyer, Dr to said Ship or House, for the full amount sold.\n\nNote 4. If you send goods to A.B., and leave it to his choice, whether to keep or return them, erect an account under the title of Sundries accounts, and charge it Dr to the goods sent off. If the goods be returned, reverse the former credit, and charge A.B. Dr to Sundries accounts, for the value of the goods sent him. If he sends up the price, charge Cash Dr to Sundries ac-\n\nounts. May 7. June 16.\n\nProb. 4. D. Debtor and Creditor applied in bartering.\n\nBarter, or the exchanging of goods for goods, is nothing else but buying and selling blended together; the cases of which, if the goods received and delivered be of equal value, are these four.\n\nCase 1. When one commodity is received for another delivered, enter Wares received Dr to Wares delivered. April 10.\n\n2. When one commodity is received for two or more delivered, enter Wares received Dr to Sundries, viz. to the several wares delivered, for their respective values.\n\n3. When two or more sorts of wares are received for one delivered, enter Sundries (viz., the several wares received, each for their value) Drs to Wares delivered. April 16.\n\n4. When several wares are bartered with A.B. for several, make two entries, and that whether the wares received and delivered be of equal value or not.\n\n1. A.B. Dr to Sundries, viz. to each sort delivered, for their respective values.\n\n2. Sundries (viz. each sort received, for their respective values) Drs to A.B. April 30.\n\nNote 1. Supposing the goods received and delivered are not in themselves of equal value, but that the deficiency is made up by money or bill, or the owner's right in any other case; for the difference upon the supposition there will be two or other cases, thus as\u2014Wares received for part wares, part money. 2. For part wares, part bill. 3. Part wares, part time. 4. Part wares, part money, part time, &c. In all which cases, Sundries are Drs to the Wares delivered. The particular Drs in each case are the same with the Crs in the cases immediately preceding, as follows.\n\nCase 1.\n\n1. To Wares delivered, for their value,\n2. To Cash, for the sum paid,\n3. To Wares delivered, for their value,\n4. To Accepter, for the bill,\n5. To Wares delivered, for their value,\n6. To Dealer, for the rest.\n\nNote 2. On the other hand, if the barter may go off, or be delivered, 1. For part wares, part money. 2. For part wares, part bill. 3. Part wares, part time. 4. Part wares, part money, part time, &c. In all which cases, Sundries are Drs to the Wares delivered. The particular Drs in each case are the same with the Crs in the cases immediately preceding, as follows.\n\nCase 1.\n\n1. To Wares received, for their value,\n2. To Cash, for the sum received, April 22.\n3. To Wares received, for their value,\n4. To Accepter, for the bill,\n5. To Wares received, for their value,\n6. To Dealer, for the rest.\n\nProb. 5. E. Debtor and Creditor applied in receiving money.\n\nIn all cases of this nature, Cash is Dr; but the Cr varies, according to the terms on which the money is received.\nCafe 1. When you receive money for goods presently sold, the entry, as already mentioned in the first case of selling, is, Cash Dr to Goods sold, for their value. Feb. 25.\n\n2. When you borrow, or take up money at interest, enter Cash Dr to the Lender, for the sum received, mentioning the rate of interest, and time of payment.\n\n3. When you get money, whether as payment of a debt, or taken up at interest, and receive it, not from the debtor or lender, but upon his assignation from a third person, enter Cash Dr to the Assignee, not to him that pays it.\n\n4. When you receive money, as payment of goods formerly sold, or in payment of an accepted bill or note, or any other debt, where neither discount nor interest is allowed, enter Cash Dr to the Payer, for the sum received, mentioning whether in full or in part. Feb. 5. March 23. April 6. July 30. Aug. 3. Nov. 12.\n\n5. When you receive money, as payment of an accepted bill or note, or any other debt, (except for goods formerly sold), per advance, and upon that account allow discount, or abatement on any other consideration, enter Sundries Drs to the Payer, viz.\n\nCash, for the sum received,\nProfit and Loss, for the sum discounted or abated. Nov. 12\n\n6. When, in receiving payment for goods formerly sold, you allow discount or abatement; if the account of said goods be closed in the Ledger, enter as in the last case; but if the said account be yet open, enter thus,\n\nSundries Drs to the Buyer, viz.\n\nCash, for the sum received,\nGoods, for the sum discounted or abated. April 1.\n\n7. When you receive money, as interest of a sum formerly lent, the principal being continued, enter Cash Dr to Profit and Loss, or to Interest account, for the sum received.

An assignment differs as to its nature and form from a bill or note; but it does not embrace the same with respect to all of them. In an assignment there are three persons concerned: 1. He who gives the assignment, called the Assignor. 2. He in whom the assignment is made, or to whom it is assigned, called the Assignee. 3. He to whom it is payable, called the Assignee. Here we shall proceed two or three cases not yet taken notice of. Suppose you pay a debt to Samuel Smith, by an assignment to Peter Evans, the creditor, and you do so after the time. 1. If you pay the assignment, enter Dr to Cash Or to Peter Evans, and Dr to Samuel Smith, for the amount or bill on you to Mr. Smith, and you do so pay presentment, enter Dr to Cash Or to Peter Evans, and Dr to Samuel Smith, for the amount or bill on Mr. Smith, which he does not pay presentment charge. 2. If you do not pay presentment, enter Dr to Cash Or to Peter Evans, and Dr to Samuel Smith, for the amount or bill on Mr. Smith, which he does not pay presentment charge. 3. If you do not pay presentment, enter Dr to Cash Or to Peter Evans, and Dr to Samuel Smith, for the amount or bill on Mr. Smith, which he does not pay presentment charge.\n\nNote 2.

B. in goods, for goods formerly bought, or for a bill you have formerly accepted, and that whether in full or part, enter Dr to Cash Or to the Goods, for the value. 2. If you pay A. B. in goods, partly for goods formerly bought, partly for a bill, enter Dr to Cash Or to the Goods, for the value, and to Cash Or to the bill, for the rest. 3. If you give him goods above the debt, and he prefers you back the balance in money, enter Dr to Cash Or to the Goods, for the turn or debt, and Dr to Cash Or to the balance due, for the balance due. 4. If you pay A. B. in goods, partly for goods formerly bought, partly for a bill, enter Dr to Cash Or to the Goods, for the value, and to Cash Or to the bill, for the rest. 5. If you pay interest on a bill, or sum borrowed, with goods, charge Dr to Cash Or to the Goods delivered, &c.\n\nNote 3. If you make a general account under the title of Debtors General, and charge in Dr to all your debts, mentioning in each entry the name of the debtor, and the date of the transaction, and get your debts paid in full payments, enter Dr to the account, by which you will know how much you own, and how much you are owed. To this creditable Dr to every bill or debt due you, enter Dr to the account, by which you will know how much you own, and how much you are owed. To this creditable Dr to every bill or debt due you, enter Dr to the account, by which you will know how much you own, and how much you are owed.\n\nNote 4. If you have an account already opened in your books, or if you have the privilege of dealing with him in other things for the future, you are not to use these general accounts.\n\nNote 5. The cases mentioned in this and the preceding problems, with regard to foreign trade comprehends, 1. The shipping of goods to a factor. 2. Advices concerning them from the factor. 3. Returns made by the factor to you.\n\nProb. 1. G. Debtor and Creditor applied in shipping off goods to a factor.\n\nIn all cases, Voyage to \u2014\u2014 is Dr; but the Cr. varies, according as the goods shipped off are already entered in your books, or presently bought; and that again, either for ready money, or on time, &c.\n\nCase 1. If you ship off goods which are already entered in your books, enter\n\nVoyage Dr to Sundries, viz.\n\nTo the respective Goods, for their value,\n\nTo Cash, for custom, insurance, and all other charges.\n\n2. If you buy a cargo for ready money, and ship it off immediately, without entering the purchase in your books, enter Voyage Dr to Cash, for prime cost, and all charges.\n\n3. If you buy goods on time, and ship them off, without entering them in your books, enter\n\nVoyage Dr to Sundries, viz.\n\nTo Seller, or Sellers, for value of the goods,\n\nTo Cash, for charges at shipping.\n\n4. If you ship off a cargo, made up partly of goods taken from your own warehouse, partly of goods bought, on time, enter\n\nVoyage Dr to Sundries, viz.\n\nTo Goods your own, for their value,\n\nTo Seller or Sellers, for value of the goods bought,\n\nTo Cash, for all charges. Jan. 21.\n\nNote 1. Several other cases may be supposed; such as, when the cargo consists of goods, your own, partly bought, or partly ready money. Or, 2. Part your goods, partly bought, partly ready money, partly on time. Or, 3. Part your own, partly bought, partly immediately received in barter, or as payment of a debt. Or, 4. As to the way or journeying thereon, and the like cases, may be easily guessed from what is already said, and therefore we shall leave them for the learner's exercise.\n\nNote 2. If you do not pay charges at shipping immediately, you must credit the factor with the charges, and enter Dr to Cash Or to the account, and charge Voyage Dr to Cash, and also you may enter Dr to Cash Or to the account.\n\nNote 3. If you do not pay charges at shipping immediately, you must credit the factor with the charges, and enter Dr to Cash Or to the account, and charge Voyage Dr to Cash, and also you may enter Dr to Cash Or to the account.\n\nNote 4. Instead of the title, Voyage to \u2014\u2014, some use Adventure to \u2014\u2014, or Adventure to \u2014\u2014 perich a boat; as, Adventure to Barbadoes for the purpose.\n\nProb. 2. H. I. Debtor and Creditor applied, upon advice from your factor, A. B.\n\nH \u00a7 1. The cases of the first advice.\n\nIn all cases of the first advice, Voyage to \u2014\u2014 is Dr; but the Cr. varies, according to the nature of the advice.\n\nCase 1. If the first advice be, That A. B. has received your goods, but sold none of them, enter A. B. my accont current Dr to Voyage, for the sum the laid voyage was formerly charged with.\n\n2. If the first advice be, That A. B. has received your goods, and sold them for ready money enter A. B. my accont current Dr to Voyage, for the neat proceeds; that is, the sum due to you, after the factor's commission and all charges are deducted. Sep. 22.\n3. If the first advice be, That the goods are received, and all sold on time, enter A.B. my accoont on time Dr to Voyage, for the neat proceeds.\n\n4. If the first advice be, That they are received, and all sold, part for ready money, part on time, enter Sundries Drs to Voyage, viz.\n\nA.B. my accoont current, for the money in his hands,\nA.B. my accoont on time, for the debts outstanding.\n\n5. If the first advice be, That the goods are not only received and sold, but a cargo shipped in return, and now at sea; here there are three varieties:\n\n1. If the value of the cargo inward, with charges paid by the factor, be equal to the neat proceeds, enter Voyage inward Dr to Voyage outward, for the neat proceeds.\n\n2. If the factor overpaid the neat proceeds, enter Voyage inward Dr to Sundries, viz., to Voyage outward for the neat proceeds, and to Factor my accoont-current, for the rent.\n\n3. If he underpaid the neat proceeds, enter Sundries (viz. Voyage inward, for its value, and A.B. my accoont current, for the rent) Drs to Voyage outward. June 18\n\n6. If the first advice be, whether from the factor or any body else, That the ship and cargo is lost at sea, there will be also three varieties:\n\n1. If the goods lost were not insured, enter Profit and Loss Dr to Voyage, for the whole value.\n\n2. If the goods lost were all insured, charge the Insurer, or Cash, if you get present payment, Dr to Voyage.\n\n3. If part of the goods only were insured, make Sundries (viz. the Insurer, or Cash, for the value insured, and Profit and Loss, for the rent) Drs to Voyage, for the whole loss.\n\nI. \u00a7 2. The cases of the second advice.\n\nIn journalizing a second or third advice, respect must be had to the entry that was made upon the advice immediately preceding; for whatever was then Dr, must be now made Cr. And therefore, supposing the first or former advice was, That the factor had received the goods, but sold none of them, the entry to be made upon a second advice will be as in the cases following.\n\nCase 1. If the second advice be, That the goods formerly received are now sold, in whole or in part, for ready money, enter A.B. my accoont-current Dr to ditto my accoont of goods, for neat proceeds.\n\n2. If the second advice be, That goods received formerly are now sold, in whole or in part, on time, enter A.B. my accoont on time Dr to ditto my accoont of goods, for neat proceeds.\n\n3. If the second advice be, That goods formerly received are now sold, part for ready money, part on time, enter Sundries Drs to A.B. my accoont of goods, viz.\n\nA.B. my accoont current, for the money in his hands.\n\nA.B. my accoont on time, for the outstanding debts.\n\nBut if the former advice had been, That the factor had sold your goods on time, then, upon this supposition, the advice that comes next, whether second or third, is journalized as follows.\n\nCase 1. If the next advice be, That the factor has now received payment of the debts outstanding, enter A.B. my accoont current Dr to ditto my accoont on time, for the sum received by him.\n\n2. If the next advice be, That he has indeed received payment of the debts, but was obliged to allow abatement, for lack of goods, or for other reasons, enter Sundries Drs to A.B. my accoont on time, viz.\n\nA.B. my accoont-current, for the sum received by him,\n\nProfit and Loss, for the sum abated.\n\nProb. 3. K.L. Debtor and Creditor applied, when returns are made by the factor.\n\nReturns are made in goods or bills.\n\nK. \u00a7 1. The cases of returns in goods.\n\nCase 1. If the factor ship off, and consign goods to yourself, advising you thereof by post, before the arrival of the ship, enter Voyage from\u2014Dr to A.B. my accoont-current, for cost and charges of the cargo, as per factor's invoice.\n\n2. If the factor ship off goods for yourself, of which you have no advice, or of which you book no advice, prior to the arrival of the ship, enter Goods received Dr to Sundries, viz.\n\nTo A.B. my accoont-current, for cost and charges, as per invoice,\n\nTo Cash, for new charges paid here.\n\n3. If your factor A.B. at Leghorn ship off goods not to yourself, but, by your order, to C.D. your factor at Lisbon, and advise you thereof, by sending you a copy of the invoice, enter Voyage from Leghorn to Lisbon Dr to A.B. my accoont-current, for cost and charges, as per invoice.\n\nNote.\u2014The entries in this problem suppose that you have received the amount of freight and debited it to your Books; as sometimes it will naturally happen to give the accoont without recollection, and then show the Dr part of a prior entry is reversed, or becomes Cr in a subsequent one.\n\nThere are two or three cases relative to theforesaid, which we shall have occasion to state. If, after the voyage has been completed, you enter Goods received Dr to Sundries, viz., to expose further, for what it was charged with, and to Cash, for charges paid here. Or, if you please, first charge Voyage Dr to Cash, for charges, see July 9.; and then discharge the same, and enter Goods received Dr to Sundries, viz., to expose further, for what it was charged with, and to Cash, for charges paid here.\n\nIf the cargo be insured, charge the Insurer, or Cash, if you get the present payment, Dr to Voyage, &c. If a cargo consigned to you happens to be lost at sea, and you do not make any entry in your Books; in this case, enter Profit and Loss, the insurer, or Cash, Dr to A.B. my accoont current, for the value lost.\n\nL. \u00a7 2. The cases of returns in bills.\n\nCase 1. If you draw upon your factor, and receive present money for the bill, enter Cash Dr to A.B. my accoont-current, for value of the bill.\n\n2. If you draw upon your factor, and give the remitter a day for payment; or if you owe the remitter, and give him the bill as payment; enter the Remitter Dr to A.B. my accoont-current, for the value of the bill July 15.\n\n3. If you draw upon your factor A.B. payable to your factor C.D. charge C.D. my accoont-current Dr to A.B. my accoont-current, for value of the bill.\n\n4. If your factor remit you a bill, for which you receive present payment, enter Cash Dr to A.B. my accoont-current, for the value of the bill.\n\n5. If your factor remit you a bill, payable at single or double usance, or any other time after date or sight; upon getting the bill accepted, enter Bills receivable Dr to A.B. my accoont-current, for value of the bill. Sept. 30.\n6. If your factor A.B. by your order, remit a bill to your factor C.D., charge C.D. my account current Dr to A.B. my account-current, for value of the bill.\n\n2. In FACTORAGE.\n\nFactorage comprehends three things: 1. The receipt of the employer's goods. 2. The disposal of them. 3. Returns made for them.\n\nProb. 1. M. Debtor and Creditor applied upon the receipt of goods.\n\nWhen you turn factor, and have goods consigned to you by your employer; upon receiving the goods, enter A.B. his account of goods Dr to Cash, for freight, custom, or other charges you pay. Aug. 10.\n\nNote 1. If there be but one kind of goods, name it, as A.B. his account of sugar, &c.; if there be more than one kind, enter each separately, as A.B. his account of sugar, &c.\n\nNote 2. Instead of the title A.B. his account of goods, sometimes A.B.'s sale, or A.B.'s sale per each article, as A.B.'s sale per the following.\n\nNote 3. If the goods be not bought in book, but regularly noted in the writer-book, it is supposed to be kept, the consignor's name being entered in the writer-book; but in such cases, where an invoice-book is kept, the common practice is, to copy them directly into it; and in the writer-book, to mention only the name, price, weight, &c., of each charge, without taking any notice of the names or quantity of the goods. Thus, the entry in the writer-book, Aug. 10, would be as follows:\n\n| Goods | Description | Quantity | Price |\n|-------|-------------|----------|------|\n| Sugar |             |          |      |\n\nProb. 2. N. Debtor and Creditor applied in disposing of your employer's goods.\n\nCase 1. When you sell all, or any part of your employer's goods, for ready money, enter Cash Dr to A.B. his account of goods, for the sum received. Aug. 17.\n\n2. When you sell all, or any part of his goods, on time, charge the Buyer Dr to A.B. his account of goods, for the sum due. Aug. 23.\n\n3. When you take all, or any part of his goods, to yourself at the current price; or when you put off his goods in barter, for others which you take to yourself; enter Goods received Dr to A.B. his account of goods, for their value.\n\n4. When all your employer's goods are disposed of, balance his account of goods; that is, charge A.B. his account of goods Dr to Sundries, viz. to Cash, for any charges paid by you, not yet booked; or to the person or persons to whom they are due, if not yet paid; and to Profit and Loss, for your commission; and to A.B. his account on time, for the outstanding debts, if any; and to A.B. his account-current, for the employer's ready money in your hands. Aug. 23.\n\n5. When you receive payment of the outstanding debts, enter as in proper trade, viz. Cash Dr to the Buyers; but if you be obliged to make abatement, for defect in weight or measure, or bad market, &c. enter Sundries Dr to the Buyer, viz.\n\nCash, for the sum received,\n\nA.B. his account-current, for the sum abated.\n\n6. When you receive payment of a debt on your employer's account, you must not only give the buyer or payer credit as directed above, but at the same time charge A.B. his account on time Dr to ditto his account-current, for the whole sum of the debt, whether any abatement be allowed or not.\n\nNote 1. If you allow abatement to the buyer, while the account of goods is yet open, you may charge A.B. his account of goods Dr to the Buyers, for the sum abated.\n\nNote 2. When you pay the persons mentioned in case 1, who get credit at balance, the account of goods, such as bankers, brokers, pawnbrokers, &c., divers, &c., enter Cash Dr to Sundries, viz. to Cash, Dr to Cash; but if they allow abatement, this being your employer's profit, not your own, charge the Receiver Dr to Sundries, viz. to Cash, for the sum paid, and to A.B. his account-current, for the sum abated. Aug. 31.\n\nProb. 3. O.P. Debtor and Creditor applied when you make returns to your employer.\n\nReturns are made either in goods or bills.\n\nO. \u00a7 1. The cases of returns in goods.\n\nCase 1. When you buy up goods for ready money, and ship them off for your employer, enter\n\nA.B. his account-current Dr to Sundries, viz.\n\nTo Cash, for prime cost of the goods,\n\nTo Cash, for charges, as custom, insurance, &c.\n\nTo Profit and Loss, for your commission.\n\n2. When you buy goods on time, and ship them off for your employer, enter\n\nA.B. his account-current Dr to Sundries, viz.\n\nTo Sellers, for prime cost of the goods,\n\nTo Cash, for charges, as custom, insurance, &c.\n\nTo Profit and Loss, for your commission.\n\n3. When you take goods of your own, and valuing them at the current price, ship them off for your employer, enter\n\nA.B. his account-current Dr to Sundries, viz.\n\nTo Goods sent off, for their value,\n\nTo Cash, for charges at shipping,\n\nTo Profit and Loss, for your commission.\n\nNote 1. There may be several other cases; as, 1. When the goods shipped off are bought, part for ready money, and part on time, May 18. 2. When part of them are bought for ready money, part of them your own. Aug. 30.\n\nNote 2. If the goods be not bought in book, but regularly noted in the writer-book, it is supposed to be kept, the consignor's name being entered in the writer-book; but in such cases, where an invoice-book is kept, the common practice is, to copy them directly into it; and in the writer-book, to mention only the name, price, weight, &c., of each charge, without taking any notice of the names or quantity of the goods. Thus, the entry in the writer-book, Aug. 10, would be as follows:\n\n| Goods | Description | Quantity | Price |\n|-------|-------------|----------|------|\n| Sugar |             |          |      |\n\nProb. 4. P. Debtor and Creditor applied when you make returns in bills.\n\nCase 1. When your employer draws a bill on you, which you accept and pay on sight, enter A.B. his account-current Dr to Cash, for value of the bill.\n\n2. When your employer draws a bill on you, payable at 1 or 2 days' notice, enter A.B. his account-current Dr to Bills Payable, for value of the bill. Sept. 3.\n\n3. When you draw upon your employer, enter Cash, if you receive present money for the bill; or, if not, the Remitter Dr to A.B. his account-current, for value of the bill. May 31.\n\n4. When you remit a bill to your employer, for which you pay ready money, enter A.B. his account-current Dr to Cash, for value of the bill. Sept. 8.\n\n5. When you remit a bill to your employer, which you either procure on time, or receive in payment of a debt due to you by the drawer, enter A.B. his account-current Dr to the Drawer, for value of the bill.\nWhen your employer remits a bill to you, enter Cash, if you receive present payment; or, if not, Bills receivable, Dr to A. B., his accoant-current, for value of the bill.\n\nNote 1. When you pay the bill mentioned in case 2, enter Bills payable Dr to Cash. Sept. 10.\n\nNote 2. Charge A. B., his accoant current Dr to Cash, for all charges you pay in making returns, such as postage.\n\nNote 3. Having now shown how to keep factory accounts in your own books, along with your other business, it will not be improper to observe, that these accounts may also be kept, by help of the Sales book, without bringing anything to your Ledger, or other books, except the accoant current, thus: Turn the Sales-book into a folio-form; and when you receive the consigned goods, enter them on the Dr side, mentioning their quantity, mark, and number, with the charges you pay; to which side also carry all after charges, abatements made to buyers, and your own commission. On the Cr side, enter the sales, mentioning the names of the buyers on time; and, as they pay, mark the article as paid on the margin; or, which will do just as well, never draw out the sums to the money columns, till you receive payment. In your Ledger, give A. B., his accoant current credit for all the money you receive for his goods, and make the same accoant Dr for all the charges paid by you, abatements made to buyers, your own commission, and returns made to your employer. But though this method may now and then be used with respect to small consignments; yet the conducting of large concerns in factory requires the use of all the five books mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.\n\nNote 4. When you cannot dispose of your employer's goods to advantage, and thereupon by his order ship them off to a factor of your own, in expectation of a better market, the regular method in this case is, 1. When you ship off the goods, enter Voyage to\u2014 for account of your Employer, Dr to Cash, for charges paid at shipping. 2. When you have advice from your factor, that he has received them, enter your Employer his accoant of goods in the hands of factor, or rather your Employer his accoant of goods at such a place, Dr to Voyage thither, for charges of the said voyage. 3. When you have advice that he has sold them, e.g. for ready money, enter your Employer his accoant current at\u2014Dr to ditto his accoant of goods at\u2014, for neat proceeds. The entry in any other case will be obvious to one who understands proper trade and factorage, as explained above. But though this be the regular method, yet in real practice, the best way, in our opinion, is, when you ship the goods, to charge the employer's accoant of goods (as they stand in your Ledger) Dr to Cash, for charges at shipping, making no more entries, till you receive the Accoant of sales, and then charge A. B., his accoant of goods, for the neat proceeds; and discharge A. B., his accoant current at\u2014, as returns are made to you by your factor.\n\n3. In PARTNERSHIP.\n\nPartnership is that branch of trade which is managed and carried on by a trustee, in the name, and for the account of the partners; that is, when a joint stock, made up by two or more merchants, is deposited in the hands of one person, to be employed by him in a way of commerce, according to instructions.\n\nMerchants, upon entering into a partnership, generally choose one of their own number, to whom they commit the management of their company-concerns; who, on account of his being partner, as well as manager or doer for the company, is called partner-trustee; and shares of gains and losses that happen, according to his share of the stock; and must allow his proportion of all charges, even of his own commission, since, in quality of trustee, he serves himself as partner equally with the rest.\n\nThe accoants of the company's affairs may be kept by the trustee in his own books, along with the accoants of his own private business; or they may be kept in separate books allotted for that purpose. The former is common practice, in matters of small concern, or short adventures; the latter is used by fixed companies, whose trade is considerable, or who have the prospect of dealing long that way.\n\nHence it is obvious, that each partner will have occasion to keep an accoant in his own books, of every thing he gives in and receives from the company, and also of what he owes to the company, or they to him; and, on the other hand, it will be the business of the trustees, not only to keep clear accoants with the persons he deals with, in buying up and disposing of goods for the company; but he must also keep distinct accoants, with respect to the partners, shewing what share each of them gives in, and what part of neat proceeds is due to them, and likewise what every one of them owes to the company, or the company to them. These things premised,\n\n1. We shall show how a partner keeps the accoants which he has occasion for.\n2. The way how a trustee keeps the accoants of the company's affairs in his own books.\n3. The manner of keeping company-accoants in books, apart, that contain nothing else.\n\n1. How a partner keeps the accoants he has occasion for.\n\nThe Ledger-accoants described.\n\nA merchant concerned as partner in a company, must keep the two Ledger-accoants following; in which observe, that A. B. represents the trustee's name.\n\n1. A. B., my accoant in company. This accoant is Dr for your inputs, and proportion of all charges, and Cr for your share of neat proceeds.\n\n2. A. B., my accoant proper. This is a personal accoant, being charged and discharged exactly as such, for the mutual debts and payments betwixt you and the trustee.\n\nNote 1. A. B., my accoant in company, is a general title, that may represent one or more kinds of goods; and that whether in the trustee's custody, or by him sent to sea. But different authors title this accoant differently. Some choose to express it thus: Goods in the hands of A. B.; or particularly, Bread cloth in the hands of A. B. If it be a sea-adventure, you may use the title, A. B., my accoant of Voyage to\u2014. If the company be\nbe fixed, the title may be taken from the commodity they deal in, as Accomp in Wine company, Accomp in Tobacco company, &c.; or from the place they trade to, as Accomp in East-India company, &c.\n\nNote 1. Instead of A.B. my accomp proper, some write A.B. my accomp current; some too write A.B. his accomp current; and others title this accomp simply by the trustee's name. But though the titles of accomps are in some sort arbitrary, or as the merchant pleases, yet it is suitable or convenient, that they carry in them some badge of distinction, shewing to what class of accomps they belong.\n\nWe now proceed to a particular application of Dr and Cr in the cases that most commonly occur on this head, which shall be confined to the two problems following.\n\nProb. 1. Q. Debtor and Creditor applied, when you give in your share of stock to the trustee.\n\nCase 1. If you give in just your own part; and that either, 1. In money, or in goods presently bought for ready money; or, 2. In goods presently bought on time; or, 3. In goods already entered in your books, enter A.B. my accomp in company Dr\n\nTo Cash, if you give in money, or pay for goods, Off. 4.\n\nTo Seller, if you buy goods on time,\n\nTo Goods proper, if the goods were formerly your own.\n\n2. If you find both your own part and the trustee's, enter Sundries (viz. A.B. my accomp in company, for your own part, and A.B. my accomp proper, for his part) Drs,\n\nTo Cash, if you give in money, or pay for goods,\n\nTo Seller, if you buy the goods on time,\n\nTo Goods proper, if you give in goods formerly your own, Off. 9.\n\n3. If the trustee provide both your part and his own, enter A.B. my accomp in company Dr to ditto my accomp proper. And when you pay him, charge A.B. my accomp proper Dr to Cash. But if he demand interest, make Sundries (viz. A.B. my accomp proper, for the debt, and Profit and Loss, for the interest) Drs to Cash.\n\nNote 1. This case is very rare; and other varieties in off. 1. hold a three mention; viz., 1. When you give in part money, part goods presently bought on time. 2. When you give in part money, part goods of your own. 3. When you give in goods, part bought on time, part your own. 4. When you give in part money, part goods bought on time, part goods of your own. In all which cases enter A.B. my accomp in company Dr to Sundries, as follows:\n\nVariety 1. To Cash, for the sum given in.\n\nTo Seller, for value of the goods bought.\n\nTo Goods proper, for their value.\n\nTo Seller, for value of the goods bought.\n\nTo Goods proper, for their value.\n\nTo Seller, for value of the goods bought.\n\nTo Goods proper, for their value.\n\nNote 2. The like varieties are mentioned in case 2. In journalising of which, the best method is first to enter A.B. my accomp in company Dr to Sundries, as in the former note, for the whole value of the money, and goods given in; and then, in another entry, charge A.B. my accomp proper Dr to sundries, as in the former note, for the part money, part goods bought for you by his part, enter A.B. Dr to A.B. my accomp proper, for the debt, and to Profit and Loss, for the interest.\n\nProb. 2 R. Debtor and Creditor applied, when goods in company are disposed of, and you receive all or part of your share of neat proceeds.\n\nCase 1. If you have advice of sales, and at the same time receive your share of neat proceeds; which may be either in money, bills, or goods; enter Cash, Bills receivable, or Goods received, Dr to A.B. my accomp in company, for value received, Off. 9. and 20.\n\n2. If you have only advice of sales on time, without receiving any thing, enter A.B. my accomp proper Dr to ditto my accomp in company, for your share of neat proceeds due to you; and when you receive payment, charge Cash, Bills receivable, or Goods, Dr to A.B. my accomp proper, for value received. But if the trustees had been obliged to allow abatement to the buyers, or had any of the debts outstanding proved bad, then, in this case if the accomp in company be yet open, enter Sundries (viz. Cash, Bills receivable, &c. for the sum received, and, A.B. my accomp in company, for your share of the sum abated or lost) Drs to A.B. my accomp proper. If the accomp in company be balanced, charge Profit and Loss Dr for your share of the abatement, or of the loss.\n\n3. If the goods are sold, part for ready money, part on time, and thereupon you receive your share of money received, enter Sundries (viz. Cash, for the sum you receive, and A.B. my accomp proper, for your share of sales on time) Drs to A.B. my accomp in company.\n\n4. If part of the goods only are sold, you may put off the booking of it till further advice; unless it be for ready money, of which you immediately receive your share; in which case, enter Cash Dr to A.B. my accomp in company, for the sum you receive.\n\n5. If you withdraw your share of stock, or any part of it, enter Cash, or Goods withdrawn, Dr to A.B. my accomp in company, for the sum or value withdrawn.\n\n6. If after the goods are disposed of, you take up only your share of neat gain, continuing your share of stock as a fund for a new adventure, charge Cash Dr to Profit and Loss, for the sum received, and let the accomp in company stand as it is.\n\nN.B. This is the ordinary case in fixed companies.\n\nNote 1. There may be other varieties in Cash, 1. & 2. besides those mentioned, viz. 1. You may receive, as your share of neat proceeds, part money, part bills, and then Sundries are Drs, viz. Cash, and Bills receivable, Off. 9. 2. You may receive part money, part goods bought, enter Drs to Cash, and Goods received, Off. 20. 3. You may receive part bills, part goods, and then the Drs are, Bills receivable, and Goods received. 4. You may receive part money, part bills, part goods, and then there will be three Drs, viz. Cash, Bills receivable, and Goods received.\n\nN.B. If the person on whom you get the bill have an accomp in your Ledger, make him Dr, and not Bills receivable.\n\n2. How a trustee keeps the company's accomps in his own books.\n\nThe Ledger accomps described.\n\nA Trustee who keeps the company's accomps in his own books, has occasion for the three Ledger accomps following, in which A.B. represent your partner's name.\n\n1. Goods in company with A.B. or Sales in company with A.B. This accomp is debited for the value of the goods brought into company, for all charges, and your commission; it is credited as you dispose of the goods, in the same manner as if the goods were your own.\n\n2. A.B. his accomp in company. This is credited for your partner's inputs, his share of charges, and proportion of neat gain at close; it is debited for his share of near\nheat proceeds, and his proportion of loss, if any, when the company accounts are finished.\n\n3. A.B his account proper. This is a personal account, which is debited and credited for the mutual debts contracted and payments made betwixt you and partners.\n\nNote 1. If the company deal in foreign trade, you who manage as trustee will have occasion for other accounts, viz., Voyage in company, Factor our account current, &c., all which are used the same way as their parallels in proper foreign trade.\n\nNote 2. As you must keep an account in company, and an account proper, for each partner; so, if these be compared with the accounts of the like name kept by the partners, they will be found exactly the reverse of one another; that is, the Dr side of the accounts kept by you will be the same with the Cr side of those kept by partners; and on the other hand, the Cr side of the former will be exactly the Dr side of the latter.\n\nNote 3. Instead of the title A.B his account proper, a great many use A.B. his account current. And it must be owned the merchant is at liberty to do in this as he inclines; it comes to the same thing in the issue, only the one title is more distinctive than the other.\n\nProb. 1. S. Dr and Cr applied, when goods are brought into company.\n\nCase 1. If the goods are bought, (which is either from you the trustee, or from a partner, or from a neutral person,) enter twice; viz. 1/3, Goods in company Dr To Goods proper, if bought of yourself, for value of To Partner's account proper, if of a partner, the goods To Cash, or Seller, if of a neutral person bought.\n\n2dly, Charge each partner his account proper Dr to ditto his account in company, for his part of the purchase Oct. 26. Nov. 22\n\nNote. When you pay a neutral person for goods bought on time, charge the said person Dr to Cash; and there is no second entry. Oct. 27. Nov. 23. But if the goods are bought on account, enter twice, namely, Dr to Cash, or Seller, for the full price, and to Goods in company, for the sum discounted or abated.\n\nCase 2. If each partner bring in just his own part of goods to company, enter once; viz.\n\nGoods in company Dr to Sundries, viz.\n\nTo Goods proper, for value of your share,\n\nTo each Partner his account in company, for value of their shares.\n\nNote 1. This is shorter than the former as if the goods were bought, though that way would be better. Enter twice the first in effect.\n\nNote 2. Enter also twice, if the partner receive in cash his own part in money, with which you buy goods; or, which is the same thing, upon buying of the goods each partner must pay down his part of the price, only Cash, and not Goods in company. Oct. 25. Nov. 1.\n\nNote 3. But if you merely book the money received from the partners, enter twice; viz. to each partner's account in company. And when you pay the money, charge Goods in company Dr to Cash, for their value; and there is no second entry.\n\nCase 3. If you or partner pay charges on goods brought into company, as carriage, insurance, &c. this augments the cost, and must be entered as the cost, namely, 1/3, Goods in company Dr To Cash, if paid by you, Oct. 25. Nov. 1.\n\nTo Partner, his account proper, if paid by him.\n\n2dly, Each partner his account proper Dr to ditto his account in company, for his share of the said charges.\n\nProb. 2. T. Debtor and Creditor applied, when goods in company are disposed of.\n\nCase 1. If goods in company are sold, (which is either to you the trustee, or to a partner, or to a neutral person,) a double entry is necessary; viz. 1/3,\n\nGoods proper, if sold to yourself,\n\nPartner's account proper, if to him on time,\n\nDr Cash, or Buyer, if to a neutral person,\n\nTo Goods in company, for their value in sale.\n\n2dly, Each partner his account in company Dr to ditto his account proper, for his share of the sale. Oct. 29. Nov. 1. and 30. Dec. 2. 18. and 28.\n\nNote 1. The entries are the same when you receive freight for a ship in company. Oct. 35. Dec. 37.\n\nNote 2. When you pay payment for goods in company formerly sold to a neutral person, charge Dr to the Buyer; and there is no second entry. Nov. 1. Dec. 13.\n\nBut if you allow discount or abatement to the buyer, a double entry is necessary; namely, (if the goods are sold Dr to Cash received, and Goods in company Dr to the sum discounted or abated) Dr to the Buyer; 2dly, Each partner his account proper Dr to ditto his account in company, for his part of the discount or abatement. Dec. 10.\n\nNote 3. If goods are lost, damaged, destroyed, or lost, enter Sundries costs. Each partner his account proper, for their respective shares of the damage or loss, and Profit and Loss, for your own share Dr to Goods in company.\n\nCase 2. If goods in company are disposed of in barter, for other goods of the same value brought into it, charge Goods in company received Dr to Goods in company delivered; and there is no second entry. Dec. 7.\n\nNote 1. If the goods to be received and delivered be of different values, a double entry will be necessary: As, suppose a trustee engaged in company with A.B each 1/3 should deliver 80 l. worth of broad cloth, in company, for tobacco to the value of 100 l.; in this case he enters twice: 1/3, Tobacco in company Dr to Sundries, viz. to Broad cloth in company, 80 l. and to Cash, or Dealer, 20 l.; 2dly, A.B. his account proper Dr to ditto his account in company, 10 l. for his share of the money now laid out or due to Dealer. Again, invert the supposition, and admit, that he delivers broad cloth in company to the value of 100 l. and receives 80 l. worth of tobacco, the rent in money, or due by his dealer; in this case he enters also twice: 1/3, Sundries (viz. Tobacco in company, 80 l. and Cash, or Dealer, 20 l.) Dr to Broad cloth in company; 2dly, A.B. his account in company Dr to ditto his account proper, 10 l. his part of money received, or due by Dealer.\n\nNote 2. If you barter goods in company, for others which you take to yourself, enter also twice: 1/3, Goods proper received Dr to Goods in company delivered; 2dly, Each partner's account in company Dr to ditto his account proper, for his part of sale. In like manner, if you barter goods of your own, for others which you bring into company, enter twice: viz. 1/3, Goods in company received Dr to Goods proper delivered; 2dly, Each partner his account proper Dr to ditto his account in company, for his part of purchase.\n\nCase 3. If you or partner withdraw just your or his exact part of goods in company remaining unsold, enter once, viz.\n\nGoods proper, if withdrawn by you,\n\nPartner's account in company, if by him,\n\nDr To Goods in company, for their value in company. Dec. 24.\n\nNote\nProb. 3. U. Debtor and Creditor applied in payments between trustee and partners.\n\nCase 1. If you the trustee receive payment of partner in money, charge Cash Dr to partner his accompt-proper, for the sum received. Oct. 27. Nov. 25.\n\n2. If partner give you his bill on E. F., charge Cash, or Bills receivable, or E. F. Dr to partner his accompt proper, for value of the bill.\n\n3. If you draw on partner, charge Cash, or E. F. viz. the man you deliver the bill to, Dr to partner his accompt proper, for value of the bill.\n\n4. If you pay partner in money, charge partner his accompt-proper Dr to Cash, for the sum paid. Nov. 4. and 17.\n\n5. If you give partner your bill on E. F. charge partner his accompt proper Dr to E. F. for value of the bill.\n\n6. If partner draw on you, charge partner his accompt proper Dr to Cash, if you pay at sight; if not, to Bills payable.\n\n7. If, in adjusting shares in company, one partner pay into another, charge partner receiver his accompt proper Dr to partner payer his accompt proper, for the sum. Nov. 27. and 25.\n\nN. B. The entry is the same, if you draw a bill upon one partner payable to another.\n\n8. If partner make payment to E. F. of a debt due by the company, charge E. F. Dr to partner his accompt proper. Nov. 25.\n\nProb. 4. V. Debtor and Creditor applied, when the company send goods to sea.\n\nCase 1. If the goods sent to sea have been formerly brought into company, and stand already entered in the books, upon shipping them off make a double entry; viz., Voyage in company to \u2014\u2014\u2014 Dr to Sundries, viz.\n\nTo Goods in company, for their value,\n\nTo Cash, for charges, as custom, insurance, &c.\n\n2dly, Each partner his accompt-proper Dr to ditto his accompt in company, for his share of charges only.\n\nNote. If partner pay the charges, the Voyage is charged Dr, not to Cash, but to partner's own account.\n\nCase 2. If the goods sent to sea are presently bought, (which is either from you, from a partner, or from a neutral person), enter also twice; namely, 1/3,\n\nVoyage in company to \u2014\u2014\u2014 Dr to Sundries, viz.\n\nGoods proper, if bought of you.\n\nTo Partner his accompt-proper, if of a partner,\n\nCash, or Seller, if of a neutral person;\n\nAnd\n\nTo Cash, for charges, if paid by you,\n\nPartner his accompt-proper, if by him.\n\n2dly, Each partner his accompt-proper Dr to ditto his accompt in company, for his part of the whole.\n\nNote. If each partner find just 1/3 own part of goods sent to sea, you may enter thus: 1/3, Voyage in company to \u2014\u2014\u2014 Dr to Sundries, viz. To Goods proper, for your share; to each partner his accompt in company, for their respective shares; and to Cash, for charges, if paid by you, or to partner his accompt-proper, if paid by him. 2dly, Each partner his accompt-proper Dr to ditto his accompt in company, for his part of the whole.\n\nProb. 5. X. Debtor and Creditor applied, upon advice from company's factor.\n\nCase 1. If you receive per advice from factor the accompt of sales, enter twice; viz. 1/3, Factor our accompt-current Dr to Voyage in company, for the amount of neat proceeds. 2dly, Each partner his accompt in company Dr to ditto his accompt-proper, for his share of the whole.\n\nCase 2. If factor in Jamaica advise you, that because he could not dispose of the goods to advantage, he has, according to orders, shipped them off to your factor at Carolina, enter twice; namely, 1/3, Voyage in company to Carolina Dr to Sundries, viz. to Voyage in company to Jamaica, for value of the cargo outward, and to Factor at Jamaica our accompt-current, for new charges paid by him. 2dly, Each partner his accompt-proper, Dr to ditto his accompt in company, for his share of new charges.\n\nCase 3. If the cargo outward be lost at sea, there are three varieties. 1. If none of the goods be insured, enter Sundries (viz. each partner his accompt in company, for his part of the loss, and Profit and Loss, for your own part) Drs to Voyage in company; and no second entry.\n\n2. If the goods be all insured, enter twice; viz. 1/3, Charge the Insurers, or Cash if you get present payment, Dr to Voyage in company. 2dly, Charge each partner his accompt in company Dr to ditto his accompt-proper, for his share of the sum received from, or due by the Insurers.\n\n3. If only part of the goods be insured, enter also twice; 1/3, Sundries (viz. Insurers, or Cash, for the value insured; each partner his accompt in company, for his share of the loss; and Profit and Loss, for your own share) Drs to Voyage in company. 2dly, Each partner his accompt in company Dr to ditto his accompt-proper, for his share of the sum received from, or due by the insurers.\n\nProb. 6. Y. Debtor and Creditor applied, when returns are made by factor.\n\nCase 1. If you receive returns in goods, enter twice; namely, 1/3, goods in company received Dr to Sundries, viz. to Factor our accompt-current, or to Voyage in company.\npany, if not yet discharged, for value of goods; and to Cash, for charges here, if paid by you, or to partner his accompt-proper, if by him). 2dly, Each partner his accompt-proper Dr to ditto his accompt in company, for his share of said charges.\n\nCase 2. If you have return in bills, enter once; namely, Cash, if remitted to you, and paid at sight, Bills receivable, if remitted to you at advance, Dr Partner his accompt proper, if remitted to him,\n\nTo Factor our accompt current, for value of the bill.\n\nCase 3. If you or partner remit a bill to the factor, enter once, viz. Factor our accompt current Dr To Cash, or the Drawer, if remitted by you, for value To Partner his accompt proper, if by him, of the bill.\n\nProb. 7. Z. Debtor and Creditor applied in admitting a new partner.\n\nThe entries to be made in admitting a new partner not being reducible to distinct cases, we shall explain the matter by a particular example. Suppose then yourself, as trustee, already in company with one partner A. each one half, for 300 l., and that you agree with B. to admit him as a third partner, upon his paying in 100 l. as his \u00bc share of stock; upon this supposition, the entries to be made are as follows.\n\n1st, You may either let the accompt of Goods in company stand as it is, till the goods are sold, or balance it, by charging Goods in company with A. and B. Dr to Goods in company with A.\n\n2dly, Charge A. his accompt in company Dr to ditto his accompt proper, 50 l. for his one half of the sale to B.\n\n2dly, If B. presently pay in his share of stock, there are three varieties. 1st, If he pay the whole to you, charge Cash Dr to B. his accompt in company, 100 l.\n\n2dly, If he pay the whole to A. charge A. his accompt proper Dr to B. his accompt in company, 100 l.\n\n3dly, If he pay one half to you, and the other to A. charge Sundries (viz. Cash, 50 l. paid in to you, and A. his accompt proper, 50 l. paid to him) Drs to B. his accompt in company.\n\n4thly, If B. do not pay in his share of stock presently, then charge B. his accompt proper Dr to ditto his accompt in company, 100 l.; and when he pays, discharge his accompt proper, as above.\n\nIII. Of the Ledger.\n\nThe Ledger is the principal book, wherein all the several articles of each particular accompt, that lie scattered in the other books according to their dates, are collected and placed together, in spaces allotted for them, in such manner, that the opposite parts of every accompt are set directly facing one another, on opposite sides of the same folio.\n\nThe Ledger is the chief or principal book of accompts, as being that which immediately answers the end of bookkeeping. For, as has been already observed, the Journal is only preparatory or introductory to the Ledger; and the Waste-book contains only the matter of accompts, without either the form or order; whereas the Ledger has all the perfection of form and order aimed at in bookkeeping, affording a ready answer to all the demands of the inquisitive merchant; and is therefore justly esteemed the principal book of the three. It is called the Ledger, (an Italian word that signifies art or dexterity), because in it the artificial part of bookkeeping chiefly appears.\n\nThe Ledger, in opposition to the scattered order of things in the Waste-book, has all the particular articles of each accompt collected and placed together; and that in such a manner, as to have the opposite articles separated, and set facing one another on opposite sides of the same folio. Thus, the opposite articles of the Cash-accompt are, the sums of money received, and the sums laid out; which accordingly stand, the former on the Dr side, and the latter on the Cr side of the same folio. Again, in an accompt of goods, the prime cost and charges go to the Dr side, and the sales to the Cr side; by comparing of which, appears the gain or loss: and so in other accompts.\n\nThe Ledger folios are divided into spaces, for containing the accompts; on the head of which are written the titles of the accompts, marked Dr on the left-hand page, and Cr on the right: Below which stand the articles, with the word To prefixed to the Dr side, and the word By on the Cr side. Upon the margin are recorded the dates of the articles, in columns allotted for that purpose. The money-columns are the same as in the other books. Before them stands the folio-column, which contains figures directing to the folio where the correspondent Ledger-entry of each article is made; for everything is twice entered in the Ledger, viz. on the Dr side of one accompt, and again upon the Cr side of some other accompt; so that these figures mutually refer from the one to the other, and are of use in examining the Ledger.\n\nFor the ready finding any accompt in the Ledger, it has an alphabet, or index, wherein are written the titles of all accompts, with the number of the folios where they stand.\n\nNote. If the Ledger-accompts be numbered, 1, 2, 3, &c. according to their order; these numbers may be inserted in the Folio-column and Index, and used instead of the folio figures. We have numbered the accompts of the following Ledger, but have not made this use of them; our design being only to refer, by means of them, to the Ledger-accompts as occasion requires.\n\nHow the Ledger is filled up from the Journal.\n\nTo transport immediately from the Waste-book to the Ledger, would, as has been formerly observed, be a complex task, and require too great a measure of thought and attention; but the former being first reduced to a Journal, the transferring from it to the Ledger becomes easy, and may be performed by the following","sp":690,"ep":705},{"h":"BOOK-KEEPING","t":"| Days | January, to pay. |\n|------|------------------|\n| 3    | To Simon Smith, 3000 crowns, at 56 d. bill of G. F. |\n|      | 7000.00          |\n| 12   | To James Jeffery, for sundry goods, |\n|      | 6813.04          |\n| 25   | To James Martin and company, |\n|      | 12500.00         |\n| 30   | To James Halley, for oil, |\n|      | 7609.10          |\n\nN. B. Upon the payment of any sum, merchants either cancel the line, or, which is better, they write the word Received or Paid upon the margin, or use some mark of their own, to signify that the sum to which it is affixed is paid.\n\n7. The Receipt-book.\n\nIn this book a merchant takes receipts of the payments he makes. The receipt should contain the date; the sum received, expressed in words at large, and also in figures in the money-columns; the reason why; and whether in full or in part; and must be signed by the person receiving. But there is no occasion to mention the merchant's name; for the book being his own, sufficiently implies that. This book is paced, and the form of it is as follows:\n\nReceived, July 1, 1769, in part for sugar, the sum of one hundred thirty six pounds, per John Stewart. 136.00\n\nReceived, this 4th of July, 1769, in full for iaid:go, the sum of forty eight pounds ten shillings, per Tho. Green. 48.10\n\nReceived, July 6, 1769, in part for lead, twenty pounds, for my master David Douglas, per Sam. Sprat. 20.00\n\nReceived, July 10, 1769, in full for copers, thirty five pounds twelve shillings, for self and company, Per David Duff. 36.12\n\nReceived, July 11, 1769, forty-five pounds twelve shillings and nine pence, in full for tobacco sold the 10th of January last, for self and partner, Per Simon Trusty. 45.12\n\nReceived, July 12, 1769, the sum of fifty pounds, by order, and for the account of George Grant, Per Nath. Smith. 50.00\n\n8. The Copy-Book of Letters.\n\nIt is very imprudent in any person to send away a letter of business, without keeping a double of it to himself; and therefore, to prevent the bad consequences of such a careless practice, merchants are provided with a large book, in folio, into which is copied verbatim every letter of business before it be sent off. So that this book, together with the letters received (which must also be carefully kept in files or boxes,) makes a complete history of all the dealings that pass betwixt a merchant and his correspondents; which may be very useful and necessary on many occasions.\n\n9. The Pocket-book.\n\nThis is a small book, of a portable size, which a merchant carries in his pocket when business calls him abroad to a tavern, a fair, the country, or other places. In this he sets down the bargains he makes, the expenses he is at, the debts he pays, or sums he receives, with every other part of business he transacts while abroad; as also any occurrence or piece of news he thinks worth while to record. And when he comes home to his compting-house or shop, he transfers the things contained in this book, each to their proper places in the Wafte-book, or Books Subsidiary.\n\nFactors of great business sometimes keep another small book, called the Memorandum book. Into this book is copied, from letters as they come to hand, short notes of the several commissions for buying goods contained in them; and as the commissions are effected, the notes are crossed, or have some mark affixed to them. This is more convenient in doing business, than to be continually running to the letters themselves. Suppose a merchant of Lisbon, by his letter, give a commission for buying goods, a note of it in the Memorandum book will stand thus.\n\nLisbon, 15th June 1769.\n\nOut of Carlos Pophain's letter an order for 4000 yards of serges, at 8 d. or 8\u00bd d. per yard, 20 dozen stockings, not above 36 s. per dozen, &c.\n\nAll which to be packed and shipped for Lisbon, consigned to himself, and marked C. P.\n\nIn like manner factors may, and those much employed generally do, take a note, from the letters of advice, of all the goods consigned to them, either in a separate place of this book, or in another book of the same nature. By this means a factor has daily under his eye, both the time when such a ship may be expected, and the goods she brings: And so is in a readier way of minding to look out for a merchant for them before-hand, than if he had only the letter as his remembrance. An example follows.\n\nNaples, 18th June 1769.\n\nIn the Prosperity, Robert Wilson master, silks for account of Anthony Carew, marked A. C.

As to unbound books, they are commonly entered by the hundred weight, and pay, if French, 13s. 6\u00bdd., but if from any other country, only 7s. 7\u00bdd.

It is performed thus: The leaves are first folded with a folding-thick, and laid over each other in the order of the signature; then beaten on a stone with a hammer, to make them smooth and open well, and afterwards pressed. They are sewed upon bands, which are pieces of cord or packthread; fix bands to a folio book, five to a quarto; octavo, &c. which is done by drawing a thread through the middle of each sheet, and giving it a turn round each band, beginning with the first, and proceeding to the last. After this the books are glued, and the bands opened and scraped, for the better fixing the pasteboards; the back is turned with a hammer, and the book fixed in a press between two boards, in order to make a groove for fixing the pasteboards; these being applied, holes are made for fixing them to the book, which is pressed a third time. Then the book is at last put to the cutting press, betwixt two boards, the one lying even with the press, for the knife to run upon, the other above it, for the knife to run against: After which the paste-boards are squared.\n\nThe next operation is the sprinkling the leaves of the book, which is done by dipping a brush into vermilion and sap-green, holding the brush in one hand, and spreading the hair with the other; by which motion the edges of the leaves are sprinkled in a regular manner, without any spots being bigger than the others.\n\nThen remains the covers, which are either of calf-skin, or of sheep-skin; these being moistened in water, are cut out to the size of the book, then smeared over with paste made of wheat flour, and afterwards stretched over the pasteboard on the outside, and doubled over the edges withinside; after having first taken off the four angles, and indented and platted the cover at the head-band: which done, the book is covered, and bound firmly between two bands, and then set to dry. Afterwards it is washed over with a little paste and water, and then sprinkled fine with a brush, unless it should be marbled; when the spots are to be made larger, by mixing the ink with vitriol. After this the book is glazed twice with the white of an egg beaten, and at last polished with a polishing-iron polished hot over the glazed cover.\n\nBookseller, one who trades in books, whether he prints them himself, or gives them to be printed by others.\n\nBooKSELLER, one who trades in books, whether he prints them himself, or gives them to be printed by others.\n\nBookellers are in many places ranked among the members of universities, and entitled to the privilege of students, as at Tubingen, Salzburg, and Paris, where they have always been distinguished from the vulgar and mechanical traders, and exempted from divers taxes and impositions laid upon other companies.\n\nThe traffic of books was anciently very inconsiderable, in so much, that the book-mERCHANTS of England, France, and Spain, and other countries, were distinguished by the appellation of Stationers, as having no shops, but only stalls and stands in the streets. During this state, the civil magistrates took little notice of the bookellers, leaving the government of them to the universities, to whom they were supposed more immediate retainers; who accordingly gave them laws and regulations, fixed prices on their books, examined their correctness, and punished them at discretion.\n\nBut when, by the invention of printing, books and booksellers began to multiply, it became a matter of more consequence, and the sovereigns took the direction of them into their own hands; giving them new statutes, appointing officers to fix prices, and granting licences, privileges, &c.","sp":739,"ep":741},{"h":"BOOK-KEEPING\n\nWASTE-BOOK","t":"August 30th.\n\nN\u00b01.

The Cash-book.\n\nThis book is kept in a folio form, like the Ledger, and serves to abridge the Cash-account there. On the left-hand page, or Dr side, Cash is charged Dr for all the sums received; and on the right-hand page, Cash is made Cr for all the sums paid. Once a week, or, which is more ordinary, once a month, this book is posted to the Ledger; or, if you please, first to the Journal, by two entries, viz. Cash Dr to Sundries, for all the receipts, and Sundries Drs to Cash, for all the payments. By this means the Cash-account in the Ledger will be so far contracted as to consist of 12 lines, viz. one for each month in the year. A specimen of this book follows.\n\n| 1769. |\n| --- |\n| **Cash, Dr.** |\n| July |\n| 1 To George Hill, received in full for lead, 90 00 00 |\n| 5 To John Scot, in part for sugar, 100 00 00 |\n| 12 To Robert Hunter, for A.

Blair's bill, 10 00 00 |\n| 25 By Holland, for 2 pieces, at 18l. 30 00 00 |\n| 31 By Charges of merchandize, 56 00 02 |\n| By House-expences, 36 00 00 |\n| **Total** | 298 02 02 |\n\nNote, Merchants that have cash-keepers must beware to write any thing in the Cash-book themselves; for if they do, the cash-keeper is no more accountable for what is stated in the book; and therefore the master, in case of money delivered to him, in the cash-keeper's absence, must keep it till he come home; and then deliver it to him, and see him enter it in the book himself.\n\n2. The Book of Charges of Merchandize.\n\nThis book is only paged, and designed to abbreviate the Cash-book. It contains particular charges on goods and voyages; such as, carriage, custom, freight, craneage, wharfage, &c.: As also other expenses that affect trade in general; such as, warehouse-rent, shop-rent, accountant's wages, postage of letters, and the like. At the end of each month the money-columns of this book are added up, and the sum carried to the credit-side of the Cash-book.\n\nN. B. At the same time you post the monthly sums of this book to the Cash book, you must debit the several accounts of goods and voyages for their particular shares of charges; which is done by posting the following entry in the Journal, namely, Sundries (viz. the several accounts of goods and voyages for their respective shares) Drs to Charges of merchandize. The remaining part of these charges will be such as relate to trade in general, being chargeable to no particular account, and will of course fall into the general account of Profit and Loss, when the account of Charges of merchandize in the Ledger is closed, at balancing the books. The form of this book follows,\n\n| 1769. |\n| --- |\n| **Charges of Merchandize, Dr.** |\n| July |\n| 1 To Cash, paid for freight of 10 tons of iron, 180 00 00 |\n| 8 To ditto, paid custom of ditto, 20 15 02 |\n| 12 To ditto, paid porterage of goods bought of A.B., 0 02 06 |\n| 18 To ditto, paid the stationers for paper, 2 14 00 |\n| 27 To ditto, paid rent of 2 cellars, 3 18 00 |\n| 31 To ditto, paid charges on 12 bales of skins, 0 01 00 |\n| **Total** | 560 02 02 |\n\nThe Book of House-expences.\n\nThis book is also paged, and designed likewise to ease the Cash-book. It contains all disbursements for family-provisions, servants wages, house-rent, apparel, utensils, &c. The money-columns of this book are also added up at the end of each month, and the sum transferred to the credit side of the Cash-book.\n\nN. B. If goods are brought from the shop for the use of the family, this more properly belongs to the Waste book, and is not to be inserted here. A specimen of this book follows.\n\n| 1769. |\n| --- |\n| **House-expences, Dr.** |\n| July |\n| 1 To Cash, paid for new cloaths, hat, and shoes, 10 00 06 |\n| 10 To ditto, paid for six drinking-glasses, 0 00 09 |\n| 17 To ditto, paid for earthen-ware, 0 03 00 |\n| 25 To ditto, paid for 12 dozen bottles, 1 00 00 |\n| 31 To ditto, paid pocket-expences, 0 09 00 |\n| To ditto, paid the housekeeper, 15 06 09 |\n| **Total** | 36 00 00 |\n\n4. The Invoice-book.\n\nThis book, which is used chiefly by factors, is paged, and contains doubles or copies of the invoices of goods sent to sea, or of goods received from abroad. The form of an invoice is as follows.\n\nLondon.\nLondon, 1st July 1769.\n\nInvoice of 8 boxes indigo, and 4 boxes spiceries, shipped per the Bonadventure, Robert Hay master, for Leith, by order, and for account of A.

S.\n\nN. B. When a merchant in Britain ships off imported goods, such as tobacco, to Holland, or other places, for sale, the invoice sent to the factor usually contains only the marks, numbers, and quantity shipped, but nothing of the prime cost or charges; which in this case could not be easily ascertained; and the want thereof is pretty well supplied by instructing the factor not to sell under such a price. But invoices of all kinds of manufactures and goods consigned from Britain to North America or the West Indies, generally exhibit prime cost and all charges; which is necessary, not only as it serves for a sort of directory to the factor, but still more so, in regard to British goods are frequently sold in those places at so much advance on the invoice prices.\n\n5. The Sales-book.\n\nThis book too is chiefly used by factors; and into it is posted, from the Waste-book, the particular sales of every consigned cargo; by which means the several articles of a sale, that lie scattered in the Waste-book, are brought together, and represented under one view, and that in a manner more full and minute than they are collected in the Ledger account. This book exhibits the sales of every consignment separately and by themselves; to which are subjoined the respective charges, such as freight, custom, the factor's commission, as also abatements allowed to buyers, &c., whose sum subtracted from the gross amount of sales, gives the neat proceeds. From this book, when a cargo is sold off, an account of sales is drawn out, in order to be transmitted to the employer. If the consignment consist but of one kind of goods, the Sales-book may be ruled and written up as in the following example.\n\nRotterdam, 1st June 1765.\n\nSales of 6 packs sugar, containing 4380 yards, received per the Friendship, Samuel Sharp master, for account of A.

The characters of this genus are taken from the horns and teeth. The horns are hollow within, and turned forward, in the form of crests: There are eight fore-teeth in the under jaw, and none in the upper, their place being supplied by a hard membrane; and there are no dog-teeth in either jaw. Linnaeus enumerates six species, viz. 1. The taurus, including the bull and cow, has cylindrical horns, bent outwards, and loose dewlaps. The bull or male is naturally a fierce and terrible animal. When the cows are in season, he is perfectly ungovernable, and often altogether furious. When chaffed, he has an air of sullen majesty, and oft tears up the ground with his feet and horns. The principal use of the bull is to propagate the species; although he might be trained to labour, his obedience cannot be depended on. A bull, like a stallion, should be the most handsome of his species. He should be large, well made, and in good heart; he should have a black eye, a fierce aspect, but an open front; a short head; thick, short, and blackish horns, and long shaggy ears; a short and straight nose, large and full breast and shoulders, thick and fleshy neck, firm reins, a straight back, thick fleshy legs, and a long tail well covered with hair. Castration remarkably softens the nature of this animal; it destroys all his fire and impetuosity, and renders him mild and tractable, without diminishing his strength; on the contrary, after this operation, his weight is increased, and he becomes fitter for the purposes of plowing, &c.\n\nThe best time for castrating bulls is at the age of puberty, or when they are eighteen months or two years old; when performed sooner, they often die. However, it is not uncommon to castrate calves a few days after birth. But such as survive an operation so dangerous to their tender age, generally grow larger and fatter, and have more courage and activity than those who are castrated at the age of puberty. When the operation is delayed till the age of six, seven, or eight years, they lose but few of the qualities of bulls, are much more furious and untractable than other oxes, and when the cows are in season, they go in quest of them with their usual ardor. See Plate LII, fig. 2.\n\nThe females of all those species of animals which we keep in flocks, and whose increase is the principal object, are much more useful than the males. The cow produces milk, butter, cheese, &c., which are principal articles in our food, and besides answer many useful purposes in various arts.\n\nCows are generally in season, and receive the bull, from the beginning of May to the middle of July. Their time of gestation is nine months, which naturally brings the veal or calves to our markets from the beginning of January to the end of April. However, luxury has fallen upon methods of interrupting this natural course, and veal may be had almost every month in the year.\n\nCows, when improperly managed, are very subject to abortion. In the time of gestation, therefore, they ought to be observed with more than ordinary care, lest they should leap ditches, &c. Neither should they be suffered to draw in the plough or other carriage, which is a practice in some countries. They should be put into the best pasture, and should not be milked for six weeks or two months before they bring forth their young. The calf should be allowed to suck and follow its mother during the first six or eight days. After this it begins to eat pretty well, and two or three sucks in a day will be sufficient. But if the object be to have it quickly fattened for the market, a few raw eggs every day, with boiled milk, and a little bread, will make it excellent veal in four or five weeks. This management of calves applies only to such as are designed for the butcher. When they are intended to be nourished and brought up, they ought to have at least two months suck; because the longer they suck, they grow the stronger and larger. Those that are brought forth in April, May, or June, are the most proper for this purpose; when calved later in the season, they do not acquire sufficient strength to support them during the winter.\n\nThe cow comes to the age of puberty in 18 months, but the bull requires two years: But although they are capable of propagating at these ages, it is better to refrain them till they be full three years. From three to nine years those animals are in full vigour; but when older, they are fit for nothing but to be fed for the butcher. A milk cow ought to be chosen young, fleshy, and with a brisk eye.\n\nThe heaviest and most bulky animals neither sleep so profoundly, nor so long as the smaller ones. The sleep of the ox is fluent and flight; he wakes at the least noise. He lies generally on the left side, and the kidney of that side is always larger than the other. There is great variety in the colour of oxen. A reddish or black colour is most esteemed. The hair should be glossy, thick, and soft; for, when otherwise, the animal is either not in health, or has a weakly constitution. The best time for inuring\ninuring them to labour is at the age of two and a half or three years.\n\nThe ox eats very quick, and soon fills his first stomach; after which he lies down to ruminate, or chew the cud. The first and second stomachs are continuations of the same bag, and very capacious. After the grass has been chewed over again, it is reduced to a kind of mash, not unlike boiled spinach, and under this form it is sent down to the third stomach, where it remains and digests for some time; but the digestion is not fully completed till it comes to the fourth stomach, from which it is thrown down to the guts. The contents of the first and second stomachs are a collection of grass and other vegetables roughly macerated; a fermentation however soon commences, which makes the grass swell. The communication between the second and third stomach is by an opening much smaller than the gullet, and not sufficient for the passage of the food in this state. Whenever then the two first stomachs are distended with food, they begin to contract, or rather perform a kind of reaction. This reaction compresses the food, and makes it endeavour to get out: Now the gullet being larger than the passage between the second and third stomachs, the pressure of the stomach necessarily forces it up the gullet. The action of rumination, however, appears to be in a great measure voluntary; as animals of this kind have a power of increasing the reaction of their stomachs. After the food undergoes a second maceration, it is then reduced into a thin pulp, which easily passes from the second to the third stomach, where it is still further macerated; from thence it passes to the fourth, where it is reduced to a perfect mucilage, every way prepared for being taken up by the lacteals, and converted into nourishment. What confirms this account of chewing the cud is, that as long as these animals suck or feed upon liquid aliment, they never ruminate; and in the winter, when they are obliged to feed upon hay and other dry victuals, they ruminate more than when they feed upon fresh grass.\n\nBulls, cows, and oxen, are fond of licking themselves, especially when lying at rest. But this practice should be prevented as much as possible; for as the hair is an undigestible substance, it lies in the stomach or guts, and is gradually coated by a glutinous substance, which in time hardens into round stones of a considerable bulk, which sometimes kills them, but always prevents their fattening, as the stomach is rendered incapable of digesting the food so well as it ought.\n\nThe age of these animals may be distinguished by the teeth and horns. The first fore-teeth fall out at the age of six months, and are succeeded by others of a darker colour, and broader. At the end of fifteen months, the next milk-teeth likewise fall out; and at the beginning of the fourth year all the fore-teeth are renewed, and then they are long, pretty white, and equal: However, as the animal advances in years, they become unequal and blackish. At the end of three years, the horns of oxen fall off, and new ones arise, which continue as long as they live. The horns of oxen four years of age are small pointed, neat, and smooth, but thicker near the head: This thick part next season is pushed further from the head by a horny cylinder, which is also terminated by another swelling part, and so on (for as long as the ox lives, the horns continue to grow); and these swellings become so many annular knots by which the age may easily be reckoned: But, from the point to the first knot must be counted three years, and every succeeding knot only one year.\n\nOx-beef is very nourishing, and yields a strong aliment; the flesh of a cow, when well fatted and young, is not much inferior. Bull-beef is hard, tough, and dry; for which reason it is not much used for food. Veal is well tasted, easy of digestion, and rather keeps the body open as otherwise.\n\nThe northern countries of Europe produce the best cattle of this kind. In general, they bear cold better than heat; for this reason, they are not so plenty in the southern countries. There are but few in Asia to the south of Armenia, or in Africa beyond Egypt and Barbary. America produced none till they were carried there by the Europeans. But the largest are to be met with in Denmark, Podolia, the Ukraine, and among the Calmuck Tartars; likewise those of Ireland, England, Holland, and Hungary, are much larger than those of Persia, Turkey, Greece, Italy, and Spain; but those of Barbary are least of all. In all mountainous countries, as Wales, the Highlands of Scotland, the black cattle are exceedingly small, but hardy, and when fattened make excellent beef. In Lapland, they are mostly white, and many of them want horns. The bull, cow, and ox, generally live about 14 or 15 years.\n\n2. The bonafus, has a long main; its horns are bent round towards the cheek, and not above a span in length. It is about the size of a large bull, and is a native of Africa and Asia. When enraged, he throws out his dung upon dogs or other animals that annoy him; the dung has a kind of caustic quality which burns the hair off any animal it falls upon.\n\n3. The bison, has likewise a long thick mane, which covers the whole neck and breast on each side. The horns are turned upwards, and exceedingly large; there is a large protuberance or bunch on the back; his eyes are red and fiery, which gives him a furious aspect. He is fierce, cruel, and so bold that he fears nothing. It is unsafe to hunt him but where the trees are large enough to hide the hunters. He is a native of Mexico and Florida.\n\n4. The grunniens, or hog-cow, has cylindrical horns, bent backwards. The body is so hairy, that the hair hangs down upon its knees like a goat. The tail has a kind of mane on each side. The colour of the body is black; but the front is white. It has bristles on its back, tail, and hind-legs. It is an inhabitant of the North of Asia.\n\n5. The bubalis, or buffalo, has large black horns bent backward and inward, and plain before. The hair on the back is very hard, but thinly scattered over the body. It is a native of Asia. But they are tamed in Italy, and used for the same purposes as black cattle in other countries. They draw carriages, and are guided\nby a rope tied to a ring thrust through their noses. The buffalo is larger than an ox, has a thicker body, and a very hard hide. His pace is slow; but he will carry a great burden. They feed in herds like cows, and yield plenty of milk, of which very good butter and cheese is made. Their flesh is pretty good, but not to be compared to beef. The wild buffalo is a very fierce and dangerous animal; he often attacks travellers, and tears them to pieces. However, they are not so much to be feared in woods as in the plains; because their horns, which are sometimes ten feet long, are apt to be entangled in the branches of trees, which gives those who are surprised by them time to escape. They are excellent swimmers, and will cross the largest river without any difficulty. They run wild in great troops on the coast of Malabar, for which reason strangers are allowed to hunt and kill them at pleasure.\n\n6. The indicus, or little Indian buffalo, has horns shorter than its ears, a bunch on its back, and no mane. It is about the size of a calf six months old, and used in the East Indies for drawing coaches, &c.","sp":744,"ep":746},{"h":"BOSCAGE","t":"the same with a grove, or thicket.\n\nBoscage, in a law sence, is that food which trees yield to cattle, as mast, &c.

J. Uses of Botany.\n\nWhen this science is carried no further than to distinguish one plant from another, its uses are few and uninteresting. However, even this exercise is attended with some advantages. It is the first, and a necessary step towards discovering those of a more noble kind. It is the rudiments of the science; and must therefore be acquired before we can expect to arrive at any improvement that may be useful to mankind. This part of botany is likewise more complete and systematic than many other branches of natural history. By means of the classical and generic marks, we are enabled in a few minutes to discover the name of any plant, from whatever quarter of the globe it may be brought. This is exceedingly curious, and altogether incredible to people unacquainted with the nature of the science. When we have learnt the name, we are then in a capacity of consulting authors with regard to the peculiar properties of the plant, so far as they are known.\n\nBesides, there is an elegance and symmetry in plants, which give rise to many agreeable emotions. Their parts, like those of animals, are possessed of all the beauties of utility, regularity, uniformity, order, and proportion. Neither is there any class of natural bodies in which the beauty of variety makes such a capital figure. This variety is chiefly exhibited in the magnitude, figure, colour, odour, and taste of vegetables. It is therefore natural to expect, that the study of botany should have some influence in improving our taste.\n\nBut as botany is confessedly a branch of natural history, the botanist ought not to confine his researches to the mere names and characters of plants. He ought to inquire into their qualities. These qualities, indeed, when we talk of vegetables in general, are exceedingly numerous, and the investigation of many of them attended with such difficulty, that no person, however industrious, can ever expect to unfold the whole. But this circumstance does not afford any argument for losing sight of utility altogether. On the contrary, it is the only thing that can give dignity to the science, or entitle it to be ranked as a branch of natural history. There is but little pleasure in studying a science which is already carried to its highest pitch of improvement. The prospect of discovering anything that may be useful to mankind stimulates our industry, and makes us prosecute our researches with vigour and alacrity.\n\nA botanist, or an inquirer into the nature and properties of vegetables, ought to direct his views principally towards the investigation of useful qualities. For this purpose, in examining plants, he should consider whether they be possessed of any qualities which may render them of use in food, in medicine, or in any of the arts. These are objects worthy the attention of philosophers. Let us examine the assistance that may be expected from the study of botany with regard to these important articles.\n\n1. Food.\u2014Many animals are endowed with an instinctive faculty of readily distinguishing whether the food that is presented to them be noxious or salutary. Mankind have no such instinct. They must have recourse to experience and observation. But these are not sufficient to guide us in every case. The traveller is often allured by the agreeableness of smell and taste to eat poisonous fruits. Neither will a general caution not to eat any thing but what we know from experience to be salutary, answer in every emergency. A ship's company, in want of provisions, may be thrown upon an uninhabited coast, or a desert island. Totally ignorant of the nature of the plants which they meet with;\u2014diseases, or scarcity of animals, may render it absolutely necessary to make use of vegetable food;\u2014the consequence is dreadful: They must\nmust first eat, before any certain conclusion can be formed. This is not the description of danger arising from an imaginary situation. Before the vegetables that grow in America, the East and West Indies, &c., became familiar to our sailors, many lives were lost by trials of this kind: Neither has all the information received from experience been sufficient to prevent individuals from still falling a prey to ignorance or rashness.\n\nIf the whole science of botany were as complete as some of its branches, very little skill in it would be sufficient to guard us infallibly from committing such fatal mistakes. There are certain orders and classes which are called natural, because every genus and species comprehended under them are not only distinguished by the same characteristic marks, but likewise possess the same qualities, though not all in an equal degree. For example: Shew a botanist the flower of a plant whose calyx is a double-valved glume, with three stamens, two pistils, and one naked seed, he can pronounce with absolute certainty, that the plant from which the flower was taken bears seeds of a farinaceous quality, and that they may be safely used as food. In like manner, shew him a flower with twelve or more stamens, all inserted into the internal side of the calyx; though it belonged to a plant growing in Japan, he can pronounce, without hesitation, that the fruit of it may be eaten with safety. On the other hand, show him a plant whose flower has five stamens, one pistil, one petal or flower-leaf, and whose fruit is of the berry kind, he will tell you to abstain from eating it, because it is poisonous. Many other examples might be given: but we shall reserve them till we come to the medical qualities.\n\nFacts of this kind make botany not only a respectable, but a most interesting science. The French and some other nations use a greater variety of vegetable food than the British. This practice is attended with many advantages. The greater number of vegetables that are made use of in any country, the poorer have the greater number of resources when there happens to be a scarcity of any particular kind. It likewise affords an opportunity of a more universal cultivation. When agriculture or gardening is confined to few plants, there is great hazard from bad seasons and other unavoidable accidents, besides the certain loss arising from allowing such soils as are improper for raising the usual plants to lie unemployed. Though we are principally influenced by example in introducing the culture of new plants; yet the advice and direction of the botanist may be useful. From his knowledge of the qualities of plants that grow in other countries, he is enabled to guess, with tolerable exactness, whether they will agree with the soil or climate in which they are proposed to be cultivated. He can do more: he can point out what particular species of the plant will be most easily naturalized. Besides, without having recourse to the example of foreign countries, the botanist can point out a number of plants that grow wild in his own country, which might be cultivated with advantage, as food either for men or cattle. For example, in the whole class called *diadelphia* by Linnaeus, which includes the *polygala*, or milkwort; the *anthyllis*, or kidney-vetch; the *orobus*, or heath-pea; the *lathyrus* and *vicia*, which comprehend a number of plants of the vetch-kind; the *ornithopus*, or bird's-foot; the *hedyarum*, or St-foin; the *alfagalus*, or wild liquorice; the *medicago*, or lucern; the *lotus*, or bird's-foot trifolium, &c.; the leaves are excellent food for cattle, and the seeds may be used either by men or cattle. In like manner, all the seeds of the grasses, which belong to the triandra clasps of Linnaeus, and are very numerous, make excellent food for men, and the leaves afford the best pasture for cattle. Many of the plants belonging to this class are not cultivated in this country, though we have a great variety of them growing wild.\n\nIt has been frequently observed, that poor people, during a scarcity of corn, have been induced to fill their bellies with substances that were both pernicious and loathsome, while they were trampling under their feet plants that would at once have afforded good nourishment and been highly grateful. This conduct could proceed from nothing but their ignorance of the nature and effects of these plants, and from their not being able to distinguish the noxious ones from the salutary. It is the duty of every man to point out the remedy for calamities of this kind, especially when it is not impossible that the causes which produced them may exist in some future period. For this purpose, we shall subjoin a short list of native plants that may be eaten with safety and advantage.\n\n*Salicornia Europaea*, or marsh-samphire, jointed glasswort, or saltwort. This plant grows plentifully near the sea-coasts, and eats very well with salt and vinegar.\n\n*Veronica becumbens*, or common brooklime. This plant, which grows in marshes, is commonly gathered in the spring, and eaten as a salad.\n\n*Valeriana locuta*, lamb's-lettuce, or corn-falter, grows in corn-fields and pasture-grounds. The leaves are reckoned more wholesome than the common lettuce cultivated in our gardens.\n\n*Scirpus maritimus*, or round-rooted cyperus, grows near the sea-shores. The root consists of a number of knots, which, after being dried and ground, have been frequently used as bread when provisions were scarce.\n\n*Bromus secalinus*, or field brome-grass, grows in vast quantities in rye-fields, especially after the rye is cut down. The seeds of this plant, mixed with grain of a better quality, make very good bread: But if the quantity of brome-grass seeds be great, the people who use the bread are apt at first to be affected with a slight degree of intoxication; but this effect ceases, after being a little accustomed to the food.\n\n*Festuca fluitans*, or flote-fescue-grass, grows in ditches and marshy places. In Sweden and Germany, the seeds are used in broths and gruels, on account both of their nutritive quality and agreeable flavour. When ground, and made into bread, they are esteemed little inferior to wheat or oats.\n\n*Triticum repens*, common wheat-grass, dog's-grass, quick-grass, or couch-grass, grows so plentifully in our fields, that it is a great object with farmers to root it out. The roots of this plant, after being washed, dried, and ground, have often been used as bread in a dearth of corn.\nWith regard to the other kinds of grasses, the seeds of them may be safely used as food; but some of them are so small, that a sufficient quantity cannot easily be collected.\n\nCampanula, or bell-flower. Nine or ten species of bell-flower grow in Britain. Both the roots and leaves, when boiled, especially before the stalk grows up, may be used.\n\nChenopodium bonus henricus, common English mercury, or all-good, grows almost everywhere. This plant is used in broth by the country-people, in place of cabbage or other pot-herbs. When the young leaves and stalks are dressed with butter, they are not inferior, in their flavour and nutritive power, to asparagus or spinach.\n\nEryngium maritimum, sea-holly, or eryngo, generally grows near the sea-shore. The young twigs, prepared as asparagus, are grateful to the taste, very nourishing, and give vigour to the body.\n\nDaucus carota, wild carrot, or bird's-neck, grows in every field. It is the same species with the carrot cultivated in gardens, and is equally nourishing.\n\nHeracleum sphondylium, or cow-parsnip. The inhabitants of Poland and Lithuania make a fermented liquor of the seeds and leaves, which the poorer sort use as ale. The inhabitants of Cambridgeshire eat the stalks, after peeling off the bark.\n\nCarum carvi, or caraways, grows in meadows and pasture-grounds. The young roots of this plant are more agreeable to the taste than the parsnip, and therefore might be of great service to the poor in a dearth of provisions.\n\nConvallaria polygonatum, or sweet-smelling Solomon's-seal, grows in the cliffs of rocks. The roots are made into bread, and eaten by the inhabitants of Lapland, when corn is scarce. The Turks use the young stalks as asparagus.\n\nBunium bulbocastanum, earth-nut, kipper-nut, pig-nut, or hawk-nut, grows plentifully on lea-grounds, the banks of rivers, sides of hills, etc. The roots are very sweet, afford excellent nourishment, and may be eaten either raw, boiled, or roasted.\n\nVaccinium uliginosum, the great bilberry-bush, grows upon high grounds. The berries are much eaten by children; but when taken in too great quantity, are apt to occasion a giddiness and headache.\n\nVaccinium myrtillus, black whorts, whortleberries, or bilberries, grows in woods. The berries have a fine flavour, and may be eaten with safety.\n\nVaccinium vitis idea, red whorts, or whortleberries, grows on hills. The berries are eaten in the autumn, and many people make an excellent jelly of them.\n\nPolygonum viviparum, small bitter, or snake-weed, grows upon high grounds. The roots may be prepared into bread. In Lapland and the northern parts of Europe, it is principally eaten along with the flesh of flags and other wild animals.\n\nSpergula arvensis, or corn-spearwort, grows in corn-fields, especially in sandy soils. In Norway, they collect the seeds of this plant, and make them into bread.\n\nSedum rupestre, or St Vincent's rock stone-crop, grows on high grounds. The Swiss cultivate this plant, and use it as a pot-herb.\n\nPrunus padus, wild cluster-cherry, or bird's-cherry, grows in woods and hedges. Some people eat the berries with salt.\n\nPrunus spinosa, the black-thorn, or sloe-tree, grows in hedges and woods. The berries are very astringent; but the leaves are tender, and, when gently toasted, may be used in place of tea.\n\nPrunus cerasus, or black-cherry, grows likewise in woods and hedges. The berries are eaten both in a crude and dried state. When this plant is wounded, a gum exudes from it nearly of the same quality with gum-arabic. Dr Hasselquist informs us, that above 100 men, when besieged in an Egyptian town, were preserved alive for more than two months, without any other sustenance than they derived from the use of this gum.\n\nCrataegus aria, or the white bean-tree, grows in woods. The berries are eaten by the peasants; and in Sweden they are prepared and used as bread when there is a scarcity of corn.\n\nCrataegus oxyacantha, the white thorn, or hawthorn, grows everywhere in woods and hedges. The berries, when dried and ground, are sometimes made into bread; but it is apt to bind the belly too much.\n\nSorbus aucuparia, the quicken-tree, or mountain-ash, grows in woods. Very good cider is made of the berries; and, when dried, they make very wholesome bread.\n\nRosa canina, red-flowered dog's-rose, or hip-tree, grows in hedges. The berries afford excellent nourishment, and may either be eaten in a crude state, or dried and made into bread.\n\nSpiraea filipendula, or drop-wort, grows in pasture-grounds and the sides of hills. The roots of this plant, which are composed of small tubercles like peas, when dried and ground, make tolerably good bread.\n\nRanunculus ficaria, pilewort, or lesser celandine, grows in pasture-grounds, etc. The Norwegians collect the leaves in the spring, and use them in broths.\n\nOriganum vulgare, or wild marjoram, grows in hedges and among brushwood. The leaves of this plant, when toasted, and infused in boiling water, have such a resemblance to tea, that it is difficult to make a distinction. As tea is so universally used in diet, it is much to be regretted that the ladies cannot be prevailed upon to prefer this or some other of our own plants, and thereby save some millions sterling annually to their country.\n\nStachys palustris, or clown's all-heal, grows in marshes and the banks of rivers. The roots are succulent, and may be used either boiled, or dried and made into bread.\n\nMelampyrum arvense, or purple cow-wheat, grows in corn-fields. Bread is sometimes made of the seeds; but it is a little bitter.\n\nSinapis arvensis, wild mustard, or charlock, grows plentifully in corn-fields, etc. The leaves of this plant are often used in broths.\n\nCrambe maritima, or sea-colewort, grows in sandy ground near the sea-shore. The leaves, when young and tender, may be used in place of cabbage; but when too old, are apt to make the head puffy.\n\nMalva rotundifolia, or dwarf-mallow, and malva sylvestris, or common mallow, are everywhere to be met with. The leaves of both these plants may be used in broths.\nOrobus tuberosus, wood-pease, or heath-pease, grows in pasture-ground, woods, hedges, &c. The roots, when boiled, or made into bread, afford excellent nourishment.\n\nPisum maritimum, or sea-pease. In the year 1655, when a great famine prevailed in England, the poor people in Oxfordshire lived principally upon the seeds of this plant.\n\nTrifolium repens, or white clover, grows in meadows and pasture-grounds. The flowers of this plant, when dried, make tolerably good bread.\n\nTrifolium pratense, purple or honeysuckle clover. The Scotch, when oppressed with a famine, used bread made of the flowers of this plant. And indeed bread may be made of the flowers of every plant belonging to the class called diadelphia, which comprehends near 600 species.\n\nHippocha\u00ebs maculata, or spotted hawkweed, grows on high pasture-grounds. The peasants of Norway use the leaves as cabbage.\n\nSonchus oleraceus, or common sow-thistle. The young leaves eat exceedingly well when boiled.\n\nTragopodon pratense, or yellow goat's-beard, grows in meadows and pasture-grounds. The roots, when dug up before the plant flowers, have a fine flavour, and are very nourishing.\n\nArctium lappa, or burdock. The young stalks, when the bark is taken off, eat, when boiled, like asparagus. Some people use them in a crude state, with oil and vinegar.\n\nCarduus palustris, or marsh-thistle. Almost all the species of thistle may be used in the same manner as the burdock.\n\nUrtica dioica, or common nettle. The use of this plant as a pot-herb is well known.\n\nQuercus robur, or common oak. Acorns, during a famine, have often been made into bread.\n\nFagus sylvatica, or beech tree. Bread has sometimes been made of the nuts; but unless they be well dried, the bread made of them will produce a slight degree of intoxication.\n\nCorylus avellana, or the hazel-nut tree. Every body knows the agreeable flavour and nutritive quality of hazel nuts.\n\nPinus sylvestris, or Scots fir. The Norwegians and others make bread of this tree in the following manner: They select such trunks as are most smooth and have least resin; they take off the bark, then dry it in the shade, and afterwards toast it over a fire, and grind it into meal. They generally mix with it a little oat-meal or barley. This bread, made of fir-bark, is not only used in a scarcity of provisions, but is eaten at all times by the poorer sort.\n\nLichen islandicus, or eryngo-leaved liver-wort, grows among heath and upon high grounds. The inhabitants of Iceland have long used this plant, both boiled, and in the form of bread.\n\nLichen vellens, or fleecy liver-wort, grows upon hills. In time of famine, the inhabitants used this plant for food.\n\nFungus, or mushroom. The species of this plant are very numerous. Some of them are used by the rich; rather as a seasoning, than as food. When taken in too great quantity, they are absolutely indigestible; and, unless thrown up from the stomach, will prove as fatal as the most deadly poison. The poor, therefore, who would be very apt to fall into this error, had better refrain from the use of mushrooms altogether.\n\nFrom this short list of esculent plants that grow wild in our own country, we see how liberally we are provided with resources in case of a scarcity of the vegetables usually cultivated for food, and at the same time the advantages that might be derived from a very slight degree of knowledge in botany. Many of these plants grow best in soils which cannot be employed for raising corn of any kind. Besides, they are exceedingly hardy, and suffer but little from seasons, which in a great measure destroy the more delicate plants which we cultivate with so much labour and expense. It may be further remarked, that many improvements in agriculture and the useful part of gardening might be expected from propagating a taste for researches into the nature and properties of vegetables.\n\n2. Medicine.\u2014It is an unhappy circumstance, that the bulk of physicians in all ages have been more remarkable for their attachment to the arbitrary and useless parts of the science, than to the nature and cure of diseases, the proper objects of their profession. Instead of disputing in folio how such a plant cures such a disease, had they exerted their industry and genius in ascertaining the fact, and then proceeded to make further inquiries into the qualities of other simples, the practice of physic would not have been a thing of such a fluctuating nature as it ever has been, and still continues to be.\n\nMany practitioners, some of them men of considerable abilities, affect to despise the science of botany, alleging that it affords no assistance to their art; and that it is very useless to load their memories with a long catalogue of hard names, without being a whit the wiser with regard to the medical properties. Besides, they imagine every single genus and species of the whole vegetable tribes to be possessed of peculiar and distinct properties; and that it would require the labour of a whole life-time to ascertain the virtues of a few plants.\n\nIt must indeed be confessed, that the writers and teachers of botany have not been sufficiently careful to prevent reflections of this kind. The technical part of the science engrosses their chief attention: If the virtues are talked of, it is only in a cursory manner: The only thing that can render the science respectable, is either totally omitted in their systems, or dispatched in a line or two. But we are happy to find, that the science begins now to get some footing in this country. By the industry and spirit of a worthy Professor *, the taste has been propagated\n\n* Dr John Hope professor of medicine and botany in the university of Edinburgh. Immediately after the Doctor's admission to the botanical chair, he offered gold and silver medals to his students for the best collections of indigenous plants\ngated in a few years far beyond what could have been expected, especially when the state of the country before that period is taken into consideration.\n\nWe have no doubt of being able to show, that botany, even in its present state, is so far from lying open to the objections brought against it by those who are either unacquainted with it, or affect to despise it as useless and trifling, that we have little reason to hope for any extensive insight into the medical virtues of plants by any other means.\n\nIn order to bring the numerous tribes of vegetables under certain classes or denominations, various methods have been adopted by different authors. Some have classified them by the figure of their roots; some by the caulis or stems; some by the leaves. Linnaeus has preferred the parts of fructification, because these are not only the most essential, but likewise the most universal.\n\nThis method of classing is preferable to any that has been proposed, on many accounts. It is found by experience, that plants which are distinguished by the same characters in the flower and fruit, have precisely the same qualities, though not always in an equal degree as to strength or weakness; so that, upon inspection of the flower and fruit, a botanist can determine a priori the effects that will result from the plant when taken into the stomach. Here then is a foundation for natural classes. In order, therefore, to determine the medical virtues of all the plants belonging to a natural class, the physician has nothing further to do than to ascertain, by a set of clear and unquestionable experiments, the virtues of any one of them. This greatly shortens the labour of investigation. Supposing the number of known species to be 25,000, by ascertaining the virtues of one genus, at a medium, you determine the virtues of 12 species. But, by ascertaining the virtues of one genus belonging to a natural order, the virtues of perhaps 300 or 400 species are ascertained. Again, by ascertaining the virtues of one genus belonging to a natural class, you discover the virtues of perhaps 800 or 1000 species.\n\nAs this branch of the materia medica has been hitherto greatly neglected, we shall subjoin a few examples of natural orders and classes, with the virtues they are supposed to possess.\n\nThe Stellatae of Mr Ray, which make the 44th natural order of Linnaeus, are said to be all diuretics. Of these, the rubia and asperula are remarkable for their diuretic and detergent qualities, and as such are admitted into both the Edinburgh and London dispensaries. The aparine, gallium, &c., possess the same qualities, though not perhaps in an equal degree.\n\nThe Asperifoliaceae of Ray, belong to the pentandra monogynia class, with one petal and four seeds, of Linnaeus, and form his 43rd natural order. The plants of this order are said to be astringent and vulnerary. Under it the following genera are comprehended: Tournefortia, cerinthe, symphytum, pulmonaria, lorrigo, cygnoglossum, anchusa, lithospermum, myosotis, heliotropium, alpeugo, lycopus, echium.\n\nThe plants included under the Pentandria, with one stylus, one flower-leaf, and which bear berries, form the 33d natural order, and are generally poisonous. To this order belong all the folana, or night-shades; the mandragora and atropa, which are well known to be poisonous; the hyoscyamus and datura occasion madness and death; the verbascum intoxicates and kills fishes.\n\nThe Umbellatae, which make the 22d natural order, are said to be aromatic, resolvent, and carminative, especially those that grow in a dry soil; but such of them as grow in a wet soil are said to be poisonous. The virtues reside in the roots and seeds. To this order belong the daucus crinitus, gentiana alba, filer montanum, ammi verum, petroselinum macedonicum, &c.\n\nThe roots of the plants belonging to the Alexandria clas, are either efficacious or poisonous. These qualities may be distinguished by the taste and smell. In the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th natural orders, the following poisonous plants of the hexandra clas are enumerated, viz.: the leucoium, galanthus, pancratium, amaryllis, fritillaria, corona imperialis, gloriae, convallaria, hyacinthus, aloes, &c. The album, cupa, and pyram, are acid; and, when taken in too great a quantity, are highly corrosive; but, as this hurtful quality is owing to a volatile alkaline substance in the roots, when they are roasted or boiled it flies off, and they may be eaten with safety.\n\nThe fruit of all the plants belonging to the Icosandra clas, which are enumerated in the 36th, 37th, 38th, and 39th natural orders, are effusent, and not one of them poisonous. To this clas belong the eugenia, punica, cerasus, crategus, pyrus, rosa, fragaria, &c.\n\nThe plants belonging to the Polyandra clas, or the 23d natural order, are mostly poisonous, e.g. the nymphea, argemone, papaver, azara, bocconia, euphorbia, delphinium, staphylinia, aconitum, nigella, errhina, aquilegia, helleborus, &c.\n\nThe leaves of the plants belonging to the Didynamia Gymnosperma, or 55th natural order, are said to be cephalic and resolvent. This order contains the ajuga, teucrium, hyssopus, lavendula, mentha, lamium, betonica, ballota, Leonurus, origanum, thymus, melissa, dracocephalum, &c.\n\nThe plants belonging to the Tetrodynamia clas, or the 57th natural order, are antiscorbutic, and a little acid; e.g. the lepidium, cochlaria, raphanus, cardamine, sinapis, erythrum barbarea, fifymbrium, &c.\n\nAll the plants of the Monodelphia clas, which form the 35th natural order, are emollient and mucilaginous. Whoever knows the qualities of the althea and malva, knows the qualities of the whole clas, which comprehends about 180 species. The emollient and mucilaginous virtues are not confined to the leaves or any par-\n\nplants prepared in the manner of a hortus siccus. The consequence of this plan fully answered his expectations. In a few years, he was in possession of many more plants than were ever formerly supposed to grow in Scotland. After this acquisition, the Dr. judiciously changed the object of his medals, and offered them for the best accounts of the sensible qualities and medical virtues of any number of native plants. But we are sorry to find, that no gentlemen have hitherto become candidates for these medals since they were offered upon this sensible and useful plan.\nparticular part, but are diffused through the whole plant.\n\nThe Diadelphia class forms the 5th natural order. This class comprehends above 500 species; and, as was observed above, the seeds of every one of them are excellent, the leaves afford excellent pasture for cattle, and not one of them have any poisonous quality.\n\nThe Syngenesia class, or 21st natural order, contains a very great number of species. The virtues of some plants belonging to this class are said to differ considerably. The bardana, carlinea, tussilago, arnica, chicorium, scorzonera, taraxacum, &c., are supposed to be deobstruent, and are kept as such in the shops. But the greatest number of them are bitter and stomachic; e.g. the absinthium abrotanum, artemisia, santolina, ballamia, tanacetum eupatorium, matricaria, chamomilla, acemila, verbesina, &c.\n\nThe Gynandria Diandra, or 4th natural order, are said to excite venery; e.g. the orchis, satyrium, serapias, herminium, ophrys, epidendrum, &c. The roots of these are used with this intention by practitioners.\n\nThe Amentaceae Acifoliae, or 15th natural order, are resinous; e.g. the pinus, abies, juniperus, cypressis, &c. They are all warm stimulants and diuretics.\n\nThe virtues of the Cryptogamia class, which comprehends the 61st, 62d, 63d, and 64th natural orders, are mostly of a suspicious nature. Hardly any of the filices are excellent; their smell is disagreeable, and they are said to kill worms. All the mulci, except the lichen ilan-dicus, are improper for food. Some of the fungi are eat; but they are a very dangerous food.\n\nPlants which have their nectaria separate from the flowers, are commonly poisonous; e.g. the epimedium, nigella, aquilegia, aconitum, monotropa, helleborus, &c.\n\nThose plants which are called lacteiflora, from their oozing out a whitish juice upon being wounded, are generally poisonous; e.g. the euphorbia, papaver, periploca, cynanthum, &c. But those which are called semisucculent by Tournefort, are of a milder nature; e.g. lactuca, hieracium, crepis, leontodon, &c.\n\nBesides natural classes and orders, which presuppose some acquaintance with botany, we are provided with other means of discovering the general qualities of plants. The sensations of smell and taste give us some intimation of the nature and qualities of plants. An agreeable taste or smell is seldom accompanied with noxious qualities; on the other hand, when these senses are disagreeably affected, the qualities are generally more or less noxious, being either purgative, emetic, or poisonous. Plants that have a sweet taste are generally nutritive; those that have a salt taste are warm and stimulant. Plants of an acid taste are corrosive; but, when deprived of their acrimony by drying, some of them become fit for food. Bitter plants are alkaline, stomachic, and sometimes of a suspicious nature. Acid plants are cooling, and allay thirst; but those of an astringent taste are astringent.\n\nEven the colour and aspect of plants throw some light upon their nature. Flowers or fruit of a red colour are generally acid. Yellow flowers indicate a bitter taste. Plants that have green flowers are crude; those of a pale colour are commonly insipid; those of a white colour are generally sweet; and those whose flowers have a gloomy and dismal aspect, are mostly poisonous.\n\nThese examples naturally suggest the following observations.\u2014The Creator of the universe hath endowed us with sufficient abilities for investigating the virtues of plants, and applying them to the cure of diseases and other useful purposes, even on the supposition that we were obliged to ascertain the virtues of every single plant by experiments. But this labour, though practicable in a course of years, and under proper regulations, is greatly abridged. The information afforded by the senses is considerable. Our inquiries are still further assisted by the general distribution of vegetables into tribes and families. The mutual relation and connection of these tribes depend not upon fancy or conjecture: The relations are so strongly marked by the similarity of their flowers, fruit, and sensible qualities, that they are conspicuous at first sight.\n\nA person unacquainted with medicine, from this view of the virtues of plants, will be apt to imagine, that botany is the only road to that science; and of course that every physician must either be a good botanist, or a bad practitioner. The thought is natural, and, with some limitation, not unjust. The common practice of physic does not require an extensive skill in the virtues of plants. A certain number of vegetables and other substances are kept in the shops, and recommended for particular purposes in dispensaries and books of practice. It is the business of the practitioner to have a general acquaintance with these, and to prescribe them according to the custom of the times. But investigations into the nature and properties of simples or drugs, require more time than can be bestowed by men of business. Whenever any science is converted into a trade, and the study of it confined to people who must live by it, there is little prospect of improvement. This has been the fate of physic. Every body dispenses medicines; but few are none inquire into their virtues. Some valuable medicines have been discovered. But by whom? Not by physicians; but by savages, old women, priests, and chemists. Until, therefore, the study of physic be considered as a branch of natural history, and cultivated by people who have time to make experiments, the science must continue to be vague, defective, and limited in its utility.\n\nBotany has always been considered as a branch of natural history. But, as was formerly observed, the useful part of it hath been too much neglected. The virtues of plants may be successfully investigated without an extensive knowledge in all the branches of the medical art. To propagate a taste for inquiries into the nature and properties of vegetables, would therefore lay the most solid foundation for improvements in medicine.\n\n3. Arts.\u2014The application of the qualities of vegetables to the various mechanical arts affords a most extensive field for useful observation. There are few plants, however different in their nature, but are found, by experience to be not only the most proper, but essentially necessary, in some particular art or employment.\n\nThe qualities which render vegetables so generally applicable to mechanical employments are principally these:\nSoftness or hardness of texture, elasticity, inflammability, astringency, colour, &c. Hence some plants are proper for domestic utensils, others for dying, tanning, &c. Some may be apt to think that qualities of this kind are not the proper objects of botany. But if the natural historian be at liberty to neglect useful qualities, he deserves little thanks for expatiating on those that are useless. It would be foreign to our design in this place, to enumerate the particular plants that are used for the various purposes of the mechanic. We shall however, by way of specimen, subjoin a list of plants that change the colour of cloths and other substances.\n\n**List of Dying Plants.**\n\n**Yellow.**\n\nCurcuma, or turmeric. This plant grows in the East Indies; the root of it tinges a rich yellow colour; but it is not very durable.\n\nRumex maritimus, or golden dock, grows on roadsides, &c. The root dyes a fine yellow.\n\nThalictrum flavum, or meadow-rue, grows in marshes, on the banks of rivers, &c. Both the root and the leaves dye a very deep yellow.\n\nUrtica dioica, or common nettle. The country people dye eggs a beautiful yellow with the roots of this plant at the feast of Easter.\n\nSantalum album, or white sanders. The wood of this tree, which is a native of the East Indies, dyes a good yellow.\n\nLawsonia inermis, or alkanna, is a small shrub cultivated in Asia and Africa. The stem and branches of this plant afford an excellent yellow; the natives paint their bodies with it. The root, prepared with quicklime, gives a fine shining red. The natives use it for dying their teeth, nails, faces, the mains of their horses, leather, &c.\n\nMorus tinctoria, or fustic, grows in America. The wood of this tree is in great esteem among dyers for the fine yellow it affords.\n\nRhamnus frangula, or the black berry-bearing alder, grows in woods and hedges. The bark rings a dull yellow; and the unripe berries dye woollen stuffs green.\n\nRhamnus catharticus, or purging buck-thorn, grows wild in woods and hedges. The bark gives a beautiful yellow.\n\nRhamnus minor, grows in the southern parts of Europe. The berries give an excellent yellow.\n\nRhus Coriaria, or sumach, grows in Italy, &c. The bark of the stem gives a yellow colour, and the bark of the root a yellowish red.\n\nBerberis vulgaris, barberry or pepperidge-bush. The root of this plant gives an excellent yellow to cloth; and the bark gives leather a beautiful yellow colour.\n\nPrunus domestica, or common plum-tree. The country people use the bark for dying their cloth yellow.\n\nPyrus malus, or apple-tree. The dyers use the bark for giving cloth a yellow colour.\n\nCarpinus betulus, the horn or hard beam tree, horse or horn-beach tree, grows in woods. The bark is used as a yellow dye.\n\nRefeda luteola, or balsam-rocket, grows in pasture grounds, meadows, and especially on chalky soil. This herb, which is a native of Scotland, gives cloth a most beautiful yellow colour, and is much used by dyers, who import it in large quantities, though it might be easily cultivated in our own country.\n\nSerratula tinctoria, or saw-wort, grows in woods and meadows. This plant gives the same colour with the refeda, and, though not so beautiful, is much used by dyers.\n\nHierachium umbellatum, or narrow-leaved bushy hawkweed, grows in woods, hedges, and gravelly soils. This plant gives a very fine yellow.\n\nAcanthus mollis, is a native of Italy. It appears that this plant was used by the ancients for dying yellow:\n\n*Et circumtextum croco velamen acantho.* Virg.\n\nBidens tripartita, or trifid water hemp-agrimony, grows in marshy places. This plant gives a pretty elegant yellow.\n\nXanthium strumarium, or lesser burdock, grows near dunghills. When this plant is boiled entire, together with the fruit, it gives a pretty good yellow.\n\nSalix pentandra, or sweet willow. The dried leaves give a fine yellow.\n\nBetula alba, or birch-tree. The leaves give a faint yellow colour to cloth.\n\nStachys sylvatica, or hedge-nettle, grows in woods and hedges, and gives a yellow colour to cloth.\n\nCentaurea jacea, or common knapweed, grows in pasture and barren grounds. This plant is often used as a succedaneum for the ferrula or saw-wort.\n\nPolygonum perfoliata, dead or spotted smartweed, grows in corn-fields, &c. and dyes cloth yellow.\n\nLythrum vulgaris, yellow willow-herb, or loose-strife, grows in marshes, and on the banks of rivers. This herb laid to dye yellow.\n\nScabiosa succisa, or devil's-bit, grows in meadows and pasture-grounds. The dried leaves give a yellow colour; but it is seldom used.\n\nAnthyllis vulneraria, kidney-yetch, or ladies-finger, grows on dry pasture-grounds. The country people use this plant for dyeing their cloth yellow.\n\nLichen juniperus, or juniper-liverwort, grows on the trunks and branches of trees. Lichen parietinus, or common liverwort, grows on walls and the bark of trees. Lichen candelarius, or yellow liverwort.

The capsules of the oak, on account of their great stickiness, are used for fixing and improving the mineral black. They are used both by dyers and curriers.\n\nThis short sketch of the utility of botany with regard to Food, Medicine, and the Arts, will be sufficient to suggest the many advantages that may be expected from the cultivation of it. The objects presented by the science are curious, respectable, and useful. The natural history of plants is not even confined to the above important articles. It is strictly connected with agriculture and gardening. The structure of vegetables, the soils that naturally produce particular kinds, things that promote or retard their growth, are essential parts of their natural history. Hence a school of botany, especially when sufficient attention is paid to the useful part of the science, merits the highest encouragement from the public, and ought to be attended by farmers, landed gentlemen, gardeners, &c., as well as by physicians and philosophers.\nSect. II. Of the Method of reducing Plants to Classes, Orders, Genera, and Species; and of investigating their generic and specific names by certain marks or characters.\n\nWe observed in the former section, that in the progress of this part of botany many different methods had been followed by different authors. C\u00e6salpinus, R.y., Bauhinus, Van Royan, Ricinus, Tournefort, Linn\u00e6us, Sauvages, have each adopted a peculiar method of characterizing and classing plants. It would be foolish to distract the attention of the reader by an explanation of all these methods. We shall therefore proceed to explain that of Linn\u00e6us, which is perhaps the only one now taught in Europe.\n\nThis method of reducing plants to classes, genera, and species, is founded upon the supposition that vegetables propagate their species in a manner similar to that of animals. Linn\u00e6us endeavours to support this hypothesis by the many analogies that subsist between plants and animals, which shall be more particularly pointed out in the third section. It is from this circumstance that Linn\u00e6us's system of botany has got the name of the Sexual System. The names of his classes, orders, &c. are all derived from this theory. He calls the stamens of flowers the males, or the male parts of generation; and the pistils females, or the female parts of generation. Plants whose flowers contain both male and female parts, are said to be hermaphrodite, &c. His classes, orders, and genera, are all derived from the number, situation, proportion, and other circumstances attending these parts, as will appear from the following scheme.\n\n**Scheme of the Sexual System.** See Plate LIII.\n\nEither publicly, i.e. have visible flowers.\n\nMonoeinia, males and females in the same bed:\u2014i.e. The flowers are all hermaphrodite, having filaments and pistils in the same flower.\n\nDiffertar, the males or stamens unconnected with each other.\n\nIndifferentissimus, the males or stamens having no determinate proportion betwixt each other as to length.\n\n1. Monandria, i.e. one male or stamen in a hermaphrodite flower.\n2. Diandria, two males or stamens.\n3. Triandria, three males.\n4. Tetrandria, four males.\n5. Pentandra, five males.\n6. Hexandra, six males.\n7. Heptandra, seven males.\n8. Octandra, eight males.\n9. Enneandra, nine males.\n10. Decandra, ten males.\n11. Dodeandra, eleven males.\n12. Icosandra, twenty, or more males inserted into the calyx, and not into the receptacle.\n\n13. Polyandra, all above twenty males inserted into the receptacle.\n\nSubordinate, two of the males or stamens uniformly shorter than the rest.\n\n14. Didynamia, four males, two of them uniformly shorter than the other two.\n15. Tetrodynamia, six males, two of which are uniformly shorter than the rest.\n\nAffinitas, the males or stamens either connected to each other, or to the pistillum.\n\n16. Monodelphia, the males or stamens united into one body by the filaments.\n17. Diadelphia, the stamens united into two bodies or bundles by the filaments.\n18. Polyadelphia, the stamens united into three or more bundles by the filaments.\n19. Syngenesia, the stamens united in a cylindrical form by the anther\u00e6.\n20. Gynandra, the stamens inserted into the pistillum.\n\nDiclinia, males and females in separate beds; i.e. plants that have male and female flowers in the same species.\n\n21. Monoecia, male and female flowers in the same plant.\n22. Dioecia, male flowers in one plant, and females in another, of the same species.\n23. Polygamia, male, female, and hermaphrodite flowers in the same species.\n\nOr clandestinely, i.e. whose parts of fructification are invisible.\n\n24. Cryptogamia, the flowers invisible, so that they cannot be ranked according to the parts of fructification.\n\nThese...\nThere twenty-four classes comprehend every known genus and species. It is an easy matter to clasify a plant belonging to any of the first eleven classes, as they all depend on the number of stamens or male parts, without regard to any other circumstance. The 12th class requires more attention. When the stamens amount to above 20, a tyro will be apt to imagine that the plant belongs to the polyandria class. In reducing plants of this kind to their classes, particular regard must be had to the insertion of the stamens. If they are inserted into the calyx or cup, the plant belongs to the icosandra class; if to the receptacle or basis of the flower, it belongs to the polyandria.\n\nThe 14th class is likewise in danger of being confounded with the 4th. In the 4th, the number of stamens is the same with that of the 14th. But, in the 14th, two of the stamens are uniformly much shorter than the other two; at the same time each particular stamen belonging to the different pairs stands directly opposite to one another.\n\nThe 15th class may be mistaken for the sixth, as they consist of the same number of stamens. But in the 15th, four of the stamens are uniformly longer than the other two; and these two are always opposite to each other.\n\n**ORDERS.**\n\nIn the first thirteen classes, the orders, which are inferior divisions, and lead us a step nearer the genus, are taken from the pistils or female parts, in the same manner as the classes from the stamens: Monogynia, digynia, trigynia, tetragynia, &c., i.e., one, two, three, four, &c., female parts: When the pistils or female parts have no stalk or filament like the stamens, they are numbered by the stigmas or tops of the pistils, which in that case adhere to the capsule in the form of small protuberances, as may be observed in the flowers of the poppy, &c.\n\nThe orders of the 14th class are derived from a different source. The plants belonging to it have their seeds either inclosed in a capsule, or altogether uncovered. Hence they naturally admit of a division into the following orders, viz., gymnopermia, comprehending such as have naked seeds; and angiopermia, which comprehends such as have their seeds covered, or inclosed in a capsule.\n\nThe 15th class is divided into two orders, viz., the filiculosa, or those which have a short siliqua or pod; and the filiquea, or those which have a longer siliqua.\n\nThe orders of the 16th, 17th, 18th, and 20th classes, are taken from the number of stamens, e.g., monodelphia pentandria, decandria, polyandria, &c.\n\nThe Syngenesia, or 19th class, consists of plants whose flowers are compounded of a great number of small flowers or florets inclosed in one common calyx. The orders of this class are,\n\nPolygamia aquatis, or such whose florets are all furnished with stamens and pistils.\n\nPolygamia spuria, comprehends those which have hermaphrodite florets in the disk, and female florets in the margin. This circumstance is made the foundation of the three following orders. 1. Polygamia superflua, includes all those whose hermaphrodite flowers in the disk are furnished with stigmas, and bear seed; and whose female flowers in the radius likewise produce seeds. 2. Polygamia frustacea, include such as have hermaphrodite seed-bearing florets in the disk; but whose florets in the radius, having no stigmas, are barren. 3. Polygamia necessaria, is the reverse of the former; The hermaphrodite flowers in the disk want stigmas, and are barren; but the female florets in the radius are furnished with stigmas, and produce seeds.\n\nPolygamia fragilata, many florets inclosed in one common calyx, and each of the florets likewise furnished with a perianthium proper to itself.\n\nMonogamia, this order consists only of seven genera, viz., the strumphia, seriphium, corymbium, jasione, lobelia, viola, and impatiens; none of which have properly compound flowers, but are ranked under this class purely from the circumstance of having their stamens united by the anther\u00e6.\n\nThe orders of the 21st class are partly taken from the number of stamens, and partly from the names and characters peculiar to some of the other classes, e.g., mon\u0153cia triandria, mon\u0153cia syngenesia, mon\u0153cia gynandria.\n\nThe orders of the 23rd are all taken from calycial characters, e.g., polygamia mon\u0153cia, polygamia ...\u0153cia, and polygamia tric\u0153cia.\n\nThe 24th, or Cryptogamia class, is divided into the four following orders: 1. Filices, comprehending all plants that bear their seed in the back or edges of the leaf, and those that are called capillary plants. 2. Musci, which comprehends all the mosses kind. 3. Algae, including the lichens, fuci, and many others whose parts of fructification are either altogether invisible or exceedingly obscure. 4. Fungi, comprehending all the mushroom tribe.\n\nHaving thus explained the method of reducing plants to their classes and orders, we shall proceed to inform the young botanist how to investigate the genus. This depends upon minute distinctions, and requires more attention. But it is impossible to investigate the genera, without being previously acquainted with a considerable number of terms. All the terms necessary for this purpose belong to the parts of fructification. To attempt to give an idea by words of the parts to which particular terms are applied, would not only be difficult, but, in a great measure, useless, especially to such as are totally ignorant of botany. We shall therefore give a list of the terms themselves, with proper references to the figures of the things signified by them, which will both be shorter, and more intelligible than the most accurate description that language is capable of.\n\n**List of Terms belonging to the Flowers and Parts of Fructification.

It has likewise been the most universal of all weapons, having obtained amongst the most barbarous and remote people, who had the least communication with the rest of mankind.\n\nThe figure of the bow is pretty much the same in all countries, where it has been used; for it has generally two inflexions or bendings, between which, in the place where the arrow is drawn, is a right line. The Grecian bow was in the shape of a \u039e, of which form we meet with many, and generally adorned with gold or silver. The Scythian bow was distinguished...\ndistinguished from the bows of Greece and other nations, by its incursion, which was so great, as to form an half moon or semicircle. The matter of which bows were made, as well as their size, differed in different countries. The Persians had very great bows made of reeds; and the Indians had also, not only arrows, but bows made of the reeds or canes of that country; the Lycian bows were made of the cornel tree; and those of the Ethiopians, which surpassed all others in magnitude, were made of the palm-tree.\n\nThough it does not appear, that the Romans made use of bows in the infancy of their republic, yet they afterwards admitted them as hostile weapons, and employed auxiliary archers in all their wars.\n\nIn drawing the bow, the primitive Grecians did not pull back their hand towards their right ear, according to the fashion of modern ages, and of the ancient Persians, but, placing their bow directly before them, returned their hand upon their right breast. This was also the custom of the Amazons.\n\nThe bow is a weapon of offence amongst the inhabitants of Asia, Africa, and America, at this day; and in Europe, before the invention of fire-arms, a part of the infantry were armed with bows. Lewis XI. first abolished the use of them in France, introducing, in their place, the halbard, pike, and broadsword. The long bow was formerly in great vogue in England, and many laws were made to encourage the use of it. The parliament under Henry VII. complained of the disuse of long bows, heretofore the safeguard and defence of this kingdom, and the dread and terror of its enemies.\n\nBow is also an instrument formerly used at sea for taking the sun\u2019s altitude; consisting of a large arch of ninety degrees graduated, a shank or staff, a shade vane, a sight vane, and an horizon vane. It is now out of use.\n\nBow, among builders, a beam of wood or bals, with three long screws, that direct a lath of wood or steel to any arch; chiefly used in drawing draughts of ships, and projections of the sphere; or where-ever it is requisite to draw large arches.\n\nBow, in music, a small machine, which, being drawn over the strings of a musical instrument, makes it resound. It is composed of a small stick, to which are fastened eighty or an hundred horse-hairs, and a screw which serves to give the hairs the proper tension. In order that the bow may touch the strings briskly, it is usual to rub the hairs with rosin.\n\nBow, among artificers, an instrument so called from its figure; in use among gunsmiths, locksmiths, watchmakers, &c., for making a drill go.

See Withers, &c.\n\nThe hind-bow bears the trousquinh or quilted roll. The bows are covered with sinews, that is, with bulls pizzels beaten, and so run all over the bows to make them stronger. Then they are strengthened with bands of iron to keep them tight, and, on the lower side, are nailed on the fadell-traps, with which they make fast the girths.\n\nBow of a ship, that part which begins at the loof, and compassing ends of the stem, and ends at the sternmost part of the fore-castle.\n\nIf a ship have a broad round bow, they call it a bold bow.

Thus, for close alleys, the flat bowl is the best; for open grounds of advantage, the round biased bowl; and for plain and level grounds, the bowl that is as round as a ball. The next is to chuse your ground; and, lastly, to distinguish the risings, fallings, and advantages of the places where you bowl.\n\nBowling, or Bow-line, in a ship, a rope made fast to the leech or middle part of the outside of the sail; it is fastened by two, three, or four ropes, like a crow\u2019s foot.\nfoot, to as many parts of the sail; only the mizen bow-line is fastened to the lower end of the yard. This rope belongs to all sails, except the sprit-sail and sprit top-sail. The use of the bow-line is to make the sails stand sharp or close, or by a wind.\n\nSharp the bow-line, is hale it taught, or pull it hard. Hale up the bow-line, that is, pull it harder forward on.

The modern brachmins make up one of the casts or tribes of the banians. They are the priests of that people, and perform their office of praying and reading the law, with several mimical gestures, and a kind of quavering voice. They believe, that, in the beginning, nothing but God and the water existed, and that the supreme Being, desirous to create the world, caused the leaf of a tree, in the shape of a child playing with its great toe in its mouth, to float on the water. From this navel thereof issued out a flower, whence Brahma drew his original, who was intrusted by God with the creation of the world, and presides over it with an absolute sway. They make no distinction between the souls of men and brutes, but say the dignity of the human soul consists in being placed in a better body, and having more room to display its faculties. They allow of rewards and punishments after this life; and have so great a veneration for cows, that they look on themselves as blessed, if they can but die with the tail of one of them in their hand. They have preserved some noble fragments of the knowledge of the ancient brachmins. They are skilful arithmeticians, and calculate, with great exactness, eclipses of the sun and moon.

When cards of the same value are turned up to two or more of the gamblers, the eldest hand gains; but it is to be observed, that the ace of diamonds wins, to whatever hand it be turned up.\n\nThe second stake is won by what is called the brag, which consists in one of the gamblers challenging the rest to produce cards equal to his: Now it is to be observed, that a pair of aces is the best brag, a pair of kings the next, and so on; and a pair of any sort wins the stake from the most valuable single card. In this part consists the great diversion of the game; for, by the artful management of the looks, gestures, and voice, it frequently happens, that a pair of fives, treys, or even duces, out-brags a much higher pair, and even some pairs royal, to the no small merriment of the company. The knave of clubs is here a principal favourite, making a pair with any other card in hand, and with any other two cards a pair royal.\n\nThe third stake is won by the person who first makes up the cards in his hand one and thirty; each dignified card going for ten, and drawing from the pack, as usual in this game.","sp":791,"ep":791},{"h":"BRAGA","t":"the capital of the province of Entre-minho-duro, in Portugal, situated on the river Cavado, 32 miles north of Porto: W. long. 8\u00b0 40', and N. lat. 41\u00b0 20'.","sp":791,"ep":791},{"h":"BRAGANZA","t":"a city of the province of Tralosmontes, in Portugal, situated on the river Sabor, in 7\u00b0 W. long. and 41\u00b0 50' N. lat.","sp":791,"ep":791},{"h":"BRAGGET","t":"a kind of drink made of malt, honey, and spices, much used in Wales.","sp":791,"ep":791},{"h":"BRAIL","t":"or BRAILS, in a ship, are small ropes made\nuse of to furl the sails across: They belong only to the two courses and the mizen sail; they are reeved through the blocks, seized on each side the ties, and come down before the sail, being at the very skirt thereof fastened to the cringles; their use is, when the sail is furled across, to hale up its bunt, that it may the more easily be taken up or let fall.

All fishes, except the cetaceous ones and the petromyzum, are furnished with these organs of respiration; which are always eight in number, four on each side the throat. That next the heart is always the least, the rest increasing in order as they stand near the head of the fish.\n\nEach of these gills is composed of a bony lamina, in form of a semicircle, for the most part; and on its convex side stand the leaves or lamell\u00e6, like so many sickles. The whole convex part of the lamell\u00e6 is befeet with hairs, which are longest near the base, and decrease gradually as they approach towards the point. There are also hairs on the concave side of the lamell\u00e6, but shorter than the others, and continued only to its middle.\nThe convex side of one lamina is fitted into the concave side of the next superior one; and all of them are connected together by means of a membrane, which reaches from their base half-way their height, where it grows thicker, and in some measure resembles a rope. The rest of the lamina is free, and terminates in a very fine and flexible point.\n\nAs to the use of these gills, they seem to be designed to receive the blood protruded from the heart into the aorta, and convey it into the extremities of the lamellae; from whence being returned by veins, it is distributed over the body of the fish.\n\nBRANCHIARUM (oramina), apertures of the gills.

In general, the Greek breviary consists of two parts; the one containing the office for the evening, the other that of the morning, divided into matins, lauds, first, third, sixth, and ninth vespers, and the compline; that is, of seven different hours, on account of that saying of David, *Septies in die laudem dixi tibi*.\n\nThe institution of the breviary is not very ancient: there have been inferred in it the lives of the saints, full of ridiculous and ill-attempted stories, which gave occasion to several reformations of it, by several councils, particularly those of Trent and Cologne; by several popes, particularly Pius V., Clement VIII., and Urban VIII.; and also by several cardinals and bishops, each lopping off some extravagances, and bringing it nearer to the simplicity of the primitive offices. Originally, every body was obliged to recite the breviary every day; but by degrees the obligation was reduced to the clergy only, who are enjoined, under penalty of mortal sin and ecclesiastical censures, to recite it at home, when they cannot attend in public. In the XIVth century, there was a particular reserve granted in favour of bishops, who were allowed, on extraordinary occasions, to pass three days without rehearsing the breviary.\n\nThis office was originally called *curfus*, and afterwards the *breviarium*, which latter name imports, that the old office was abridged, or rather, that this collection is a kind of abridgment of all the prayers.\n\nThe breviaries now in use are innumerable; the difference between them consists principally in the number and order of the psalms, hymns, pater-nosters, ave-Maries, creeds, magnificats, cantemus's, benedictus's, canticamus's, sanctus dimitris's, miserere's, hallelujah's, gloria patri's, &c.\n\n**Breviary**, in Roman antiquity, a book first introduced by Augustus, containing an account of the application of the public money.\n\n**Breviator**, an officer under the eastern empire, whose business it was to write and translate briefs.\n\nAt Rome those are still called breviators, or abbreviators, who dictate and draw up the pope's briefs.\n\n**Brevibus a rotulis liberandis**, a writ or command to a sheriff to deliver to his successor the county, with the appurtenances, and the rolls, writs, and other things to his office belonging.\n\n**Brevier**, among printers, a small kind of type or letter between bourgeois and minion.\n\n**Brevium custos**, See Custos.\n\n**Brevordt**, a town of Guelderland, in the United Netherlands, situated about twenty-five miles southeast of Zutphen, in 6\u00b0 35' E. long. and 52\u00b0 N. lat.\n\n**Brewer**, a person who professes the art of brewing.\n\nThere are companies of brewers in most capital cities; that of London was incorporated in 1427, by Hen.

Before we treat of this operation, it will be necessary to explain the nature of malt, and the method of making it.\n\n**OF MALT.**\n\nThat species of fermentation which is called the vinous fermentation, is only producible by the juices of vegetable substances. The sugar or saccharine matter is the cause of this fermentation. If sugar be added to water in the proportion of 1 to 3, a proper vinous fermentation is excited. When this saccharine matter is extracted from vegetables, they immediately lose their fermentative power. Most plants either naturally contain this saccharine matter, or are capable of acquiring it by a certain method of treatment. This process of converting vegetable substances into a sugar is known by the name of malting.\n\nThough most vegetable substances be convertible into malt, barley is found by experience to be the most proper for undergoing this operation.\n\nAs the converting of grains into malt, is only a part of the progress towards their germination, it may be performed by committing them for some time to the earth. But the ordinary method is to steep the barley for some time in water, and then to expose it in heaps on the floor of a barn till it begins to heat; after which, it must be spread out in thin layers, to prevent putrefaction. It ought to continue in this situation till the plume or bud is just about to escape from the seed, and then it is considered as perfectly malted; that is, the seeds are converted into a sweet, moist substance. This change of taste, or malting, keeps exact pace with the progress of the plume; hence one half of the seed is frequently malted, while the other undergoes no change. If the plume be allowed to shoot fully out, the seeds immediately lose their saccharine taste, and are changed into insipid hollow...\nhollow bags. When seeds are thus sufficiently malted, they must be dried in malt-kilns, the fuel of which should smoke as little as possible.\u2014The hulls must now be broken open by malt-mills, and then infused or mashed in warm water, in order to extract the saccharine substance; the heat applied should be very slow and gradual. Thus the malt is dissolved, and lies till the liquor be sufficiently tinctured. When the malt is too long diffused, so that an acetous fermentation begins to take place, it is called blinking, or fixing, by brewers.\n\nThis tincture obtained from the infusion of grinded malt, is commonly known by the name of wort.\n\nWe shall now give an account of this process in the language and manner of the actual brewer, which will probably be more acceptable than treating it in a philosophical manner.\n\nOf making Malt.\n\nThe barley must be put into a leaden or tiled cistern, that holds five, ten, or more quarters, and covered with water four or six inches above the barley, to allow for its swell. Here it must lie five or six tides, as the ralster calls it, reckoning twelve hours to the tide, according as the barley is in body or in drienefs. The way to know when it is enough, is to take a corn, end-ways, between the fingers, and gently crush it; and if it be in all parts metlow, and the husk opens, or starts a little from the body of the corn, then it is enough. The nicey of this is a material point; for if it be infused too much, the sweetness of the malt will be greatly taken off, and yield the least spirit, and will cause deadnefs and sournefs in ale or beer in a short time, for the goodnefs of the malt contributes much to the preservation of all ales and beers. Then the water must be well drained from it, and it will come equal and better on the floor, which may be done in twelve or sixteen hours in temperate weather, but in cold near thirty. From the cistern, it is put into a square hutch or couch, where it must lie thirty hours; then it must be worked night and day in one or two heaps, as the weather is cold or hot, and turned every four, six, or eight hours, the outward part inwards, and the bottom upwards, always keeping a clear floor, that the corn that lies next to it be not chilled; and as soon as it begins to come or spire, then turn it every three, four, or five hours, as was done before, according to the temper of the air, which greatly governs this management; and as it comes or works more, so must the heap be spreaded and thinned larger to cool it. Thus it may lie and be worked on the floor in several parallels, two or three feet thick, ten or more feet broad, and fourteen or more in length, to chip or spire, but not too much nor too fast; and when it is come enough, it is to be turned twelve or fifteen times in twenty-four hours, if the season is warm, as in March, April, or May; and when it is fixed, and the root begins to be dead, then it must be thickened again, and carefully kept often turned and worked, that the growing of the root may not revive, and this is better done with the shoes off than on: And here the workman's art and diligence in particular is tried, in keeping the floor clear, and turning the malt often, that it neither moulds nor acre-spires, that is, that the blade does not grow out at the opposite end of the root; for, if it does, the flower and strength of the malt is gone, and nothing left behind but the acre-spire, husk, and tail: Now, when it is at this degree, and fit for the kiln, it is often put into a heap, and let lie twelve hours before it is turned, to heat and mellow, which will much improve the malt if it is done with moderation, and after that time it must be turned every six hours during twenty-four; but if it is overheated, it will become like grease and be spoiled, or at least cause the drink to be unwholesome. When this operation is over, it then must be put on the kiln, to dry four, six, or twelve hours, according to the nature of the malt; for the pale sort requires more leisure, and less fire, than the amber or brown sorts: Three inches thick was formerly thought a sufficient depth for the malt to lie on the hair-cloth; but now six is often allowed it; fourteen or sixteen feet square will dry about two quarters, if the malt lies four inches thick, and here it should be turned every two, three, or four hours, keeping the hair cloth clear: The time of preparing it from the cistern to the kiln is uncertain, according to the season of the year; in moderate weather, three weeks are often sufficient. When the malt is dried, it must not cool on the kiln, but be directly thrown off, not into a heap, but spread wide in an airy place, till it is thoroughly cool; then put it into a heap, or otherwise dispose of it.\n\nThere are several methods used in drying of malts, as the iron-plate frame, the tile-frame, that are both full of little holes; the brafs-wired, and iron-wired frame; and the hair-cloth. The iron and tiled ones were chiefly invented for drying of brown malts, and saving of fuel; for these, when they come to be thorough hot, will make the corns crack and jump by the fierceness of their heat, so that they will be roasted or scorched in a little time; and after they are off the kiln, to plump the body of the corn, and make it take the eye, some will sprinkle water over it, that it may meet with the better market: But if such malt is not used quickly, it will slacken and lose its spirits to a great degree, and perhaps, in half a year or less, may be taken by the whools and spoiled. Such hasty dryings, or scorings, are also apt to bitter the malt, by burning its skin, and therefore these kilns are not so much used now as formerly. The wire-frames indeed are something better, yet they are apt to scorch the outward part of the corn, that cannot be got off so soon as the hair-cloth admits of, for these must be swept when the other is only turned at once; however, these last three ways are now in much request for drying pale and amber malts, because their fire may be kept with more leisure, and the malt more gradually and better dried. But by many the hair-cloth is reckoned the best.\n\nMalts are dried with several sorts of fuel; as the coak, Welch coal, straw, wood, and fern, &c. But the coak is reckoned by most to exceed all others for making drink of the finest flavour and pale colour, because it sends no smoke forth to hurt the malt with any offensive tang, that wood, fern, and straw are apt to do.\nin a lesser or greater degree; but there is a difference even in what is called coak, the right sort being large pit-coal charred or burnt in some measure to a cinder, till all the sulphur is consumed and evaporated, which is called choak; and this, when it is truly made, is the best of all other fuels. But if there be but one cinder as big as an egg, not thoroughly cured, the smoke of this one is capable of doing damage, which happens too often by the negligence or avarice of the choak-maker: There is another sort, by some wrongly called choak, and rightly named culm or Welch-coal, from Swainzey in Pembrokeshire, being of a hard stony substance, in small bits, resembling a shining coal, and will burn without smoke, and by its sulphureous effluvia cast a most excellent whitenees on all the outward parts of the grainy body: In Devonshire their marble or grey fire-stone is burnt into lime with the strong fire that this culm makes, and both this and the chalked pit-coal afford a moderate and certain fire to all malt that is dried by it. Straw is the next sweetest fuel; but wood and fern are the worst.\n\nSome put a peck or more of peas, and malt them with five quarters of barley, to mellow the drink: Beans are used for the same purpose; but they do not come so soon, nor mix so conveniently with the malt, as the pea.\n\nBarley is not fit to make malt of till it is fully mellowed and sweated in the mow, and the season of the year is ready for it, without both which there can be no assurance of good malt. This untimely making of malt often occasions bad ales and beers; for such malt retaining some of its barley nature, or that the season of the year is not cold enough to admit of its natural working on the floor, is not capable of producing a true malt, but will cause its drink to sink in the cask instead of growing fit for use, as not having its genuine malt nature to cure and preserve it, which all good malts contribute as well as the hop.\n\nMellilet, a most thieving weed that grows among barley, if not thoroughly cleaned from it before malting, makes the drink so heady, that it is apt to intoxicate the unwary by drinking a small quantity: Besides, it gives a nauseous flavour to the liquor.\n\nTo know good from bad Malts.\n\nFirst, break the malt-corn across between the teeth, in the middle, or at both ends, and if it rather mellow and sweet, has a round body, breaks soft, is full of flour all its length, smells well, and has a thin skin, then it is good. Secondly, take a glass near full of water, and put in some malt; if it swells, it is right; but if any sticks to the bottom, then it is not true malt, but steely, and retains somewhat of its barley nature; this, however, is not an infallible rule, because, if a corn of malt is cracked, split, or broke, it will then take the water and sink; but an allowance may be given for such incidents, and still room enough to make a judgment. Thirdly, malt that is truly made will not be hard and steely, but of so mellow a nature, that, if forced against a dry board, it will mark, and cast a white colour almost like chalk. Fourthly, malt that is not rightly made will be part of it of a hard barley nature, and weigh heavier than that which is true malt.\n\nOf the Nature and Use of Pale, Amber, and Brown Malts.\n\nThe pale malt is the slowest and slackest dried of any, and where it has had a leisure fire, a sufficient time allowed it on the kiln, and a due care taken of it, the flour of the grain will remain in its full quantity, and thereby produce a greater length of wort than the brown high-dried malt. It may be brewed either with spring or common well water.\n\nThe amber-coloured malt is that which is dried in a medium degree, between the pale and the brown, and is very much in use, as being free of either extreme. Its colour is pleasant, its taste agreeable, and its nature wholesome, which makes it be preferred by many as the best of malts; this by some is brewed either with hard or soft waters, or a mixture of both.\n\nThe brown malt is the soonest and highest dried of any, even till it is so hard, that it is difficult to bite some of its corns asunder. This malt, by some, is thought to occasion the gravel or stone, and is by its steely nature less nourishing than the pale or amber malts, being very much impregnated with the fiery particles of the kiln, and therefore its drink sooner becomes sharp and acid than that made from the pale or amber sorts, if they are all fairly brewed: For this reason the London brewers mostly use the Thames or New River waters to brew this malt with, for the sake of its loft nature, whereby it agrees with the harsh qualities of it better than any of the well or other hard sorts, and makes a luscious ale for a little while, and a bit-beer, or porter, that will keep very well five or six months; but after that time it generally grows stale, notwithstanding there be ten or twelve bushels allowed to the hogshead, and it be hopped accordingly.\n\nPale and amber malts dried with coak or culm, obtain a more clean, bright, pale colour, than if dried with any other fuel, because there is not smoke to darken and foul their skins or husks, and give them an ill relish, which those malts have, more or less, that are dried with straw, wood, or fern, &c. The coak or Welch coal also makes more true and compleat malt than any other fuel, because its fire gives both a gentle and certain heat, whereby the corns are in all their parts gradually dried; and therefore of late these malts have gained such a reputation, that great quantities have been consumed in most parts of the nation for their wholesome nature and sweet fine taste.\n\nNext to the coak-dried malt, the straw dried is the sweetest and best tasted: This, it must be acknowledged, is sometimes well malted, where the barley, wheat, straw, conveniences, and the maker's skill, are good; but as the fire of the straw is not so regular as the coak, the malt is attended with more uncertainty in its making; because it is difficult to keep it to a moderate and equal heat, and also exposes the malt in some degree to the taste of the smoke.\n\nBrown malts are dried with straw, wood, and fern, &c.\nOf grinding Malts.\n\nThis article well deserves the notice of all brewers, for on it the goodness of our drink greatly depends; because, if it is ground too small, the flour of the malt will be the easier and more freely mixed with the water, and will cause the wort to run thick; therefore the malt must be only just broke in the mill, to make it emit its spirit gradually, and incorporate its flour with the water in such a manner, that first a stout beer, then an ale, and afterwards a small beer may be had at once; and the same brewing, and the wort run off fine and clear to the last. Many are likewise so garrulous as to grind their brown malt a fortnight before they use it, and keep it in a dry place, that it may become mellower, by losing in a great measure the fury of its harsh fiery particles, and its feely nature, which this sort of malt acquires on the kiln. However, this, as well as many other hard bodies, may be reduced by time and air into a more soluble, mellow, and soft condition, and then it will imbibe the water, and give a natural kind tincture more freely, by which a greater quantity and stronger drink may be made than if it was used directly from the mill, and be much smoother and better tasted. But pale malts will be fit for use at a week's end, because the leavening of their drying endows them with a softness from the time they are taken off the kiln to the time they are brewed, and supplies in them what time and air must do in the brown sorts. This method of grinding malt so long beforehand cannot be so conveniently practised by some of the great brewers, because several of them brew two or three times a week; but now most of them grind their malts into the tun by the help of a long, descending, wooden spout; and here they save the charge of emptying or uncasing it out of the bin, and also the waste of a great deal of the malt-flour, that is lost when carried in baskets. A steel hand-mill, will, by the help of only one man, grind six or eight bushels in an hour, and will last a family many years without hardening or cutting. There are some old-fashioned stone hand-mills in being, that some prefer to the iron ones, because they allege that these break the corn's body, when the iron ones only cut it in two, which occasions the malt, so broke by the stones, to give the water a more easy, free, and regular power to extract its virtue, than the cut-malt can that is more confined within its hull. Notwithstanding, the iron ones are now mostly in use, for their great dispatch and long duration. In the country they frequently throw a sack of malt on a stone or brick floor as soon as it is ground, and let it lie, giving it one turn, for a day or two, that the stones or bricks may draw out the fiery quality it received from the kiln, and give the drink a soft mild taste.\n\nOf the Nature of several Waters, and their Use in Brewing.\n\nWater is a matter of great importance in brewing wholesome fine malt-liquors. Now, the more simple and freer every water is from foreign particles, it is the better.\n\nSpring-waters are in general liable to partake of those minerals through which they pass. At Uppingham in Rutland, their water is said to come off an alum rock, and so tinges their beer with its saline quality, that it is easily tasted at the first draught. But that which will lather with soap, or soft water, that percolates through chalk, or a grey fire-stone, is generally accounted best; for chalk in this respect excels all other earths, because it communicates nothing unwholesome to the waters, but absorbs any minerals that may accompany the water that runs through them: For which reason they throw in great quantities of chalk into their wells at Aylesbury to soften their water, which, coming off a black sandstone, is so hard and sharp, that it will often turn their beer sour in a week's time; so that in its original state it is neither fit to wash nor brew with, but so long as the alkaline particles of the chalk hold good, they put it to both uses.\n\nRiver-water is less liable to be loaded with metallic, purifying, or saline particles, than the well or spring sorts, especially at some distance from the spring head, because the rain-water mixes with and softens it. But in running, it often collects gross particles, from muddy mixtures, particularly near town, which make the beer subject to new fermentations, and grow foul upon any alteration of the weather, as the Thames-water, generally does; yet this, for its softness, is much better than the hard sort; however, both these waters are used by some brewers. But where river-water can be had clean in a dry time; when no great rain has lately fell out of rivulets, or rivers that have a gravelly, chalky, sandy, or stony bottom, free from the disturbance of cattle, &c., and in good air, it may then justly claim the name of a most excellent water for brewing, and will make a stronger drink with the same quantity of malt than any of the well-waters; insomuch that that of the Thames has been proved to make as strong beer with seven bushels of malt, as well-water, with eight; and so are all river-waters in a proportionable degree, and, where they can be obtained clean and pure, drink may be drawn fine in a few days after tunning.\n\nRain-water is very soft, of a most simple and pure nature, and the best diluter of any, especially if received free from dirt and mortar that often mix with it as it runs off tiled roofs; this is very agreeable for brewing of ales that are not to be kept long, but for beers that are to remain some time in the casks, it is not so good, being apt to putrefy the soonest of any.\n\nPond waters. This includes all standing waters, chiefly from rain, and are good or bad according to circumstances; for where there is a clean bottom, and the water lies undisturbed from the tread of cattle, or too many fish, in an open sound air, in a large quantity, and\nwhere the sun has free access, it is then nearly as good as rain or river-waters. But where it is in a small quantity, or full of fish (especially the sling-tench) or is so disturbed by cattic, as to force up mud and filth, it is then the most foul and disagreeable of all others: So is it likewise in long dry seasons, when our pond-waters are so low as to oblige us to strain it through sieves before we can use it, to take out the small red worms and other corruptions that stagnant waters are subject to.\n\nThe London Method of Brewing.\n\nStout Butt beer or Porter.\n\nThis is the strongest porter that is brewed from brown malt, and often sold for forty shillings the barrel, or six pounds the butt out of the wholesale cellars: The liquor (for it is six-pence forfeit in the London brew-house if the word water is named) in the copper designed for the first mash, has a two-bushel basket, or more, of the most hulky malt thrown over it, to cover its top, and afterwards its boiling; this must be made very hot, almost ready to boil, yet not so as to blister, for then it will be too high heat; but, as an indication of this, the foul part of the liquor will ascend, and the malt swell up, and then it must be parted, looked into, and felt with the finger or back of the hand, and if the liquor be clear, and of such heat as can be but just endured, it is then enough, and the stoker must damp his fire as soon as possible, by throwing in a good parcel of fresh coals, and shutting his iron vent-doors; immediately on this, they let as much cold liquor or water run into the copper as will make it all of a heat, somewhat more than blood-warm; this they pump over, or let it pass by a cock into an upright wooden square spout or trunk, and it directly rises through the holes of a false bottom into the malt, which is worked by several men with oars for about half an hour, and is called the first and stiff mash: While this is doing, there is more liquor heating in the copper, that must not be let into the mash-run till it is very sharp, almost ready to boil; with this they mash again, then cover it with several baskets of malt, and let it stand an hour before it runs into the under-back, which, when boiled an hour and a half with a good quantity of hops, makes this stout. The next is mashed with a cooler liquor, then a sharper, and the next blood-warm or quite cold; by which alternate degrees of heat, a quantity of small beer is made after the stout.\n\nTo make Porter, or Butt-beer, to have a fine Tang.\n\nThis, of late, has been improved two ways: First, by mixing two bushels of pale malt with six of brown, which will preserve butt-beer in a mellow condition, and cause it to have a pleasant sweet flavour: And, secondly, further to improve and render it more palatable, they boil it two hours and a half, and work it two days as cold as possible in the tun; at last, they stir it, and put a good handful of common salt into the quantity of a butt: Then, when the yeast has had one rising more, they run it.\n\nStrong Brown Ale, called Stitch.\n\nMost of this is the first running of the malt, but yet of a longer length than is drawn from the stout; it has but few hops boiled in it, and is sold for eight pence per gallon at the brew-house out of the tun, and is generally made to amend the common brown ale with, on particular occasions.\n\nCommon Brown Ale and Starting-beer.\n\nThey take the liquors from the brown ale as for the stout, but draw a greater quantity from the malt than for stout or stitch; and after the stiff and second mash, they cap the goods with fresh malt, to keep in the spirit, and boil it an hour; after this, small beer is made of the same goods. Thus also the common brown starting butt-beer or porter is brewed, only boiled with more hops an hour and a half, and worked cooler and longer than the brown ale, and a shorter length drawn from the malt. But it is customary after the brown ale, or when a quantity of small beer is wanted, or is to be brewed better than ordinary, to put so much fresh malt on the goods as will answer that purpose.\n\nPale and Amber Ales and Beer.\n\nAs the brown malts are brewed with river, these are brewed with well or spring-liquors. The liquors are by some taken sharper for pale than brown malts, and, after the first scalding liquor is put over, some lower the rett by degrees, to the last, which is quite cold, for their small beer; and for butt-beers, there is no other difference than the addition of more hops, and boiling, and the method of working.\n\nEntire Guile Small Beer.\n\nOn the first liquor they throw some hulky malt, to show the break of it, and when it is very sharp, they let in some cold liquor, and run it into the tun milk-warm; this is mashed with thirty or forty pulls of the oar, and let stand till the second liquor is ready, which must be almost scalding hot to the back of the hand; then run it by the cock into the tun, mash it up, and let it stand an hour before it is spent off into the under-back: These two pieces of liquor will make one copper of the first wort, without putting any fresh malt on the goods; the next liquor to be blood-warm, the next sharp, and the next cool or cold; for the general way in great brew-houses is, to let a cool liquor precede a sharp one, because it gradually opens the pores of the malt and goods, and prepares the way for the hotter liquor that is to follow.\n\nThe several Lengths or Quantities of Drinks that have been made from Malt, and their several Prices, as they have been sold at a common Brew-house.\n\nFor stout-beer, is commonly drawn one barrel off a quarter of malt, and sold for thirty shillings per barrel from the tun. For stitch or strong brown ale, one barrel and a firkin, at one and twenty shillings and four pence per barrel from the tun. For common brown ale, one barrel and a half, or more, at sixteen shillings per barrel, that holds thirty-two English gallons from the tun. For entire small beer, five or six barrels off a quarter, at seven or eight shillings per barrel from the tun. For pale and amber ale, one barrel and a firkin, at one shilling per gallon, from the tun.\nA Method practised by a Vintualler, for Brewing Ale or October Beer, from Nottingham.\n\nHis copper holds twenty-four gallons, and the mash-tub has room enough for four or more bushels of malt. The first full copper of boiling water he puts into the mash-tub, there to lie a quarter of an hour, till the steam is so far spent that he can see his face in it; or, as soon as the hot water is put in, throws a pail or two of cold water into it, which will bring it at once into a temper; then he lets three bushels of malt be run leisurely into it, and stirred or mashed all the while, but as little as can be, or no more than just to keep the malt from clotting or balling; when that is done, he puts one bushel of dry malt at the top, to keep in the vapour or spirit, and so lets it stand covered two hours, or till the next copper-full of water is boiling hot, which he ladles over the malt or goods three hand-bowls full at a time, that are to run off at the cock or tap by a very small stream before more is put on, which again must be returned into the mash-tub till it comes off exceeding fine; for, unless the wort is clear when it goes into the copper, there are little hopes it will be so in the barrel; which leisure way obliges him to be fifteen hours in brewing these four bushels of malt. Now between the ladings-over he puts cold water into the copper to be boiling hot, while the other is running off; by this means his copper is kept up near full, and the cock spending to the end of brewing his ale or small beer, of which only twenty-one gallons must be saved of the first wort that is referred in a tub, wherein four ounces of hops are put, and then it is to be set by. For the second wort we will suppose there are twenty gallons of water in the copper boiling hot, that must be all laded over in the same manner as the former was, but no cold water need here be mixed; when half of this is run out into a tub, it must be directly put into the copper with half of the first wort, strained through the brewing-sieve as it lies on a small wooden frame over the copper, to keep back those hops that were first put in to preserve it, which is to make the first copper twenty-one gallons; then, upon its beginning to boil, he puts in a pound of hops in one or two canvas or other coarse linen bags, somewhat larger than will just contain the hops, that an allowance may be given for their swell; this he boils away very briskly for half an hour, when he takes the hops out and continues boiling the wort by itself till it breaks into particles a little ragged, and then it is enough, and must be dispersed into the cooling-tubs very thin: Then put the remainder of the first and second wort together, and boil that the same time, in the same manner, and with the same quantity of fresh hops, as the first was. The rest of the third or small-beer wort will be about fifteen or twenty gallons more or less, which he mixes directly with some cold water to keep it free of excise, and puts it into the copper as the first liquor to begin a second brewing of ale, with another four bushels of malt as he did before, and so on for several days together if necessary; and at last there may be some small-beer made.\n\nThe Nature and Use of the Hop.\n\nThis vegetable was formerly thought to be an wholesome ingredient. Indeed, when the hop, in a dear time, is adulterated with water, in which aloes, &c., have been infused, in order to make the old hops recover their bitterness, and seem new, then they are to be looked on as unwholesome; but the pure new hop, when properly managed, has no hurtful qualities. But if the hops are boiled in strong or small worts beyond their fine and pure nature, the liquor suffers, and will be tainted with a noxious taste, both ungrateful and unwholesome to the stomach; and, if boiled to a very great excess, they will be apt to cause reachings. It is for these reasons that we advise the boiling two parcels of fresh hops in each copper of ale-wort; and, if there were three for keeping beer, it would be so much the better for the taste, health of body, and longer preservation of the beer in a sound smooth condition. For this purpose, some make a bag, like a pillowbox, and boil the hops in it half an hour; then take them out, and put in another bag of the like quantity of fresh hops, and boil them half an hour more; by which means there is an opportunity of boiling both wort and hops a due time, saving the trouble of straining them through a sieve, and securing the seeds of the hops at the same time from mixing with the drink; afterwards they boil the same bags in the small beer, till the substance of it is got out; but observe that the bags be made larger than what would just contain the hops, otherwise it will be difficult to boil out their substance. It is true, that there is a charge increased by the consumption of a greater quantity of hops than usual; but then how greatly will they answer the desired end of enjoying fine-palated wholesome drink, that, in a cheap time, will not amount to much, if bought at the best hand; and, if we consider their after-use and benefit in small beer, there is not any loss at all in their quantity: But, where it can be afforded, the very small beer would be much improved if fresh hops were also shifted in the boiling of this as well as the stronger worts. Hence may appear the hardships that many are under of being necessitated to drink of those brewers malt-liquors, who, out of avarice, boil their hops to the last, that they may not lose any of their quintessence.\n\nAfter the wort is cooled and put into the working-vat or tub, some throw fresh hops into it, and work them with the yeast, at the same time referring a few gallons of raw wort to wash the yeast through a sieve to keep back the hop. This is a good way where enough of hops have not been sufficiently boiled in the wort, or to preserve it in the coolers where it is laid thick.\n\nWhen hops are dear, many use the seeds of wormwood instead of them: Others use the daucus or wild-carrot seed that grows in our common fields, which many of the poor people gather and dry in their houses, for the purpose of selling them to the brewers: Others use horseradish, which indeed is a fine bitter, and grows on several of our commons.\n\nHops have a fine grateful bitter, which makes the drink easy of digestion; they also keep it from running into such cohesions as would make it ropy, vapid, and sour; and therefore are not only of great use in boiled, but in raw worts, to preserve them found till they can be\nput into the copper, and afterwards in the tun, while the drink is working.\n\nHere then it must be observed, that the earthy part of the hop is the cause of that rough, harsh, unpleasant taste which accompany both ales and beers that have the hops so long boiled in them, as to tincture their worts with their mischievous effects; for, notwithstanding the malt be ever so good, the hops, if boiled too long in them, will be so predominant as to cause a bad taste.\n\nOf boiling Malt-liquors.\n\nAlthough it has been formerly said, that an hour and a half is requisite for boiling of October beer, and an hour for ales and small beer; yet it is to be observed, that an exact time is not altogether a certain rule in this case; for, when loose hops are boiled in the wort so long till they all sink, their seeds will arise and fall down again: the wort also will be curdled, and broken into small particles if examined in a hand-bowl, but afterwards into larger, as big as great pins heads, and will appear clean and fine at the top. This is so much a rule with some, that they regard not time, but this sign, to show when the wort is boiled enough; and this will happen sooner or later, according to the nature of the barley, and its being well malted; for, if it comes off chalks or gravels, it generally has the good property of breaking or curdling soon; but, if off tough clays, then it is longer, which, by some persons, is not a little valued, because it saves time in boiling, and consequently the consumption of the wort.\n\nIt is also to be observed, that pale malt-worts will not break so soon in the copper, as the brown sorts; but, when either of their worts boil, it should be to the purpose, for then they will break sooner, and waste less, than if they are kept simmering, and will likewise work more kindly in the tun, drink smoother, and keep longer.\n\nNow all malt-worts may be spoiled by too little or too much boiling: If too little, then the drink will always taste raw, mawkish, and be unwholesome in the stomach, where, instead of helping to dilute and digest our food, it will cause obstructions, cholics, head-aches, and other diseases: Besides, all such under-boiled drinks are certainly exposed to staleness and sourness, much sooner than those that have had their full time in the copper. And if they are boiled too long, they will then thicken and not come out of the copper fine and in a right condition, which will cause it never to be right clear in the barrel.\n\nBut to be more particular, no ale-worts, boiled less than an hour, can be good; because, in an hour's time, they cannot acquire a thickness of body any ways detrimental to them; and, in less than an hour, the famous viscid parts of the ale cannot be sufficiently broke and divided, so as to prevent its running into cohesions, ropiness, and sourness; because in ales there are not hops enough allowed to do this, which good boiling must in a great measure supply, or else such drink can never be good; for then its cohesive parts being not thoroughly broke and comminuted by time and boiling, remain hard, and in a good measure indigestible in the stomach: How ignorant are these people, who, in tippling of such liquor, can praise it for excellent good ale, only because its taste is sweetish, (which is the nature of such raw drinks), believing it to be the pure effect of the genuine malt, and not perceiving the brewer's avarice and cunning, to save the consumption of his wort by shortness of boiling, tho' to the great prejudice of the drinker's health?\n\nIn boiling, both time and the curdling or breaking of the wort should be consulted; for if a person was to boil the wort an hour, and then take it out of the copper before it was rightly broke, it would be wrong management, and the drink would not be fine and wholesome; and if it should boil an hour and a half, or two hours, without regarding when its particles are in a right order, then it may be too thick; so that due care must be had to the two extremes, to obtain it in its due order; therefore, in October and keeping beers, an hour and a quarter's good boiling is commonly sufficient to have a thorough cured drink; for generally in that time it will break and boil enough; because in this there is a double security by length of boiling, and a quantity of hops shifted; but in the new way there is only a single one, and that is by a double or treble allowance of fresh hops boiled only half an hour in the wort; and for this practice a reason is assigned, that the hops, being endowed with different aperitive qualities, will, by them and their great quantity, supply the defect of underboiling the wort; and that a farther conveniency is here enjoyed by having only the fine, wholesome, strong, floury, spirituous parts of the hop in the drink, exclusive of the phlegmatic, earthy parts which would be extracted, if the hops were to be boiled above half an hour; and therefore there are many now that are attached to this new method, that they will not brew ale or beer any other way, thinking, that if hops are boiled above thirty minutes, the wort will exhibit some of their bad qualities.\n\nThe allowance of hops for ale or beer cannot be exactly adjusted without coming to particulars, because the proportion should be according to the nature and quality of the malt, the season of the year it is brewed in, and the length of time it is to be kept.\n\nFor strong brown ale brewed in any of the winter-months, and boiled an hour, one pound is but barely sufficient for a hogshead; if it be tapped in three weeks or a month.\n\nIf for pale ale brewed at that time, and for that age, one pound and a quarter of hops; but if these ales are brewed in any of the summer-months, there should be more hops allowed.\n\nFor October or March brown beer, a hogshead made from eleven bushels of malt boiled an hour and a quarter, to be kept nine months, three pounds and a half ought to be boiled in such drink at the least.\n\nFor October or March pale beer, made from fourteen bushels, boiled an hour and a quarter, and kept twelve months, six pounds ought to be allowed to a hogshead of such drink, and more if the hops are shifted in two bags, and less time given the wort to boil.\nOf Foxing or Tainting Malt-Liquors.\n\nFoxing is a misfortune, or rather a disease, in malt-drinks, occasioned by divers means, as the nastiness of the utensils, putting the worts too thick together in the backs or coolers, brewing too often and soon one after another, and sometimes by bad malts and waters, and the liquors taken in wrong heats, being of such pernicious consequence to the great brewer in particular, that he sometimes cannot recover and bring his matters into a right order again in less than a week or two, and is so hateful to him in its very name, that it is a general law among them to make all servants that name the word Fox or Foxing in the brew-house to pay six-pence, which obliges them to call it Reynard; for, when once the drink is tainted, it may be smelt at some distance somewhat like a Fox: It chiefly happens in hot weather, and causes the beer and ale so tainted to acquire a fulsome sickly taste, that will, if it is received in a great degree, become ropy like treacle, and in some short time turn sour.\n\nAnd here we shall mention the great value of the hop in preventing and curing the fox in malt-liquors. When the wort is run into the tub out of the mashing-vat, it is a very good way to throw some hops directly into it before it is put into the copper, and they will secure it against furnels and ropinels, that are the two effects of foxed worts or drinks, and are of such power in this respect, that raw worts may be kept some time, even in hot weather, before they are boiled, and which is necessary where there is a large quantity of malt used to a little copper; but it is certain that the stronger worts will keep longer with hops than the smaller sorts: So likewise, if a person has fewer tubs than are wanted, and he is apprehensive his worts will be foxed by too thick lying in the coolers or working tubs, then it will be a safe way to put some fresh hops into such tubs, and work them with the yeast, or, in case the drink is already foxed in the vat or tun, new hops should be put in and worked with it, and they will greatly fetch it again into a right order; but then such drink should be carefully taken clear off from its gross nasty lees, which being mostly tainted, would otherwise lie in the barrel, corrupt, and make it worse.\n\nSome lift quicklime into foxed drinks while they are working in the tun or vat, that its fire and salt may break the cohesions of the beer or ale, and burn away the stench that the corruption would always cause; but then such drink should by a peg at the bottom of the vat be drawn off as fine as possible, and the dregs left behind.\n\nOf fermenting and working of Beers and Ales.\n\nThough a small quantity of yeast be necessary to ferment and fine the wort; yet it is in itself of a poisonous nature, and if beat into the wort too often or in too large a quantity, by its stupifying and narcotic quality, it makes the liquor so heady, that five bushels of malt may be equal in strength to six. But liquor made in this manner is extremely unwholesome.\n\nIt is alleged indeed, that beating the yeast into wort gives it a fine relish; or it makes the ale bite of the yeast; but the true reason is, to further its sale, on account of its intoxicating quality. But some people are so fond of white thick ale, that they often kill themselves by drinking it; nor is their humor much different as to the common brewers brown ale, who, when the customer wants a hogshead, they put in immediately a handful of salt, and another of flour, and so bring it up; this is no sooner on the stilling than it is tapped, that it may carry a froth on the top of the pot, otherwise they despise it.\n\nSee Chemistry, Of fermentation.\n\nOf working and fermenting London Stout Beer and Ale.\n\nThe yeast is at once put into the tun to work the stout-beer and ale with; by this means, and the shortness of time we have to ferment our strong drinks, we cannot make reserves of cold worts to mix with and check the too forward working of those liquors. The strong beer brewed for keeping is suffered to be blood-warm in the winter, when the yeast is put into it, that it may gradually work two nights and a day at least, for this will not admit of such a hasty operation as the common brown ale, because, if it is worked too warm and hasty, such beer will not keep near so long as that fermented cooler. The brown ale has, indeed, its yeast put into it in the evening very warm, because it is often carried away the very next morning. The pale or amber ales are often kept near it, not quite a week under fermentation, for the better incorporating the yeast with the wort.\n\nOf forwarding and retarding the Fermentation of Malt-liquors.\n\nIn case beer or ale is backward in working, it is customary to cast some flour out of the stuffing-box, or with the hand, over the top of the drink, which will become a sort of crust or cover to help to keep the cold out: Others put in one or two ounces of powdered ginger, which heats the wort and brings it forward: Others take a gallon stone-bottle and fill it with boiling water, which, being well corked, is put into the working tub, where it communicates a gradual heat for some time, and forwards the fermentation: Others reserve some raw wort, which they heat and mix with the rest; but then care must be taken, that the pot in which it is heated has no manner of grease about it, lest it should impede, instead of promoting the working; but, for retarding and keeping back any drink that is too much heated in working, the cold raw wort is the most proper of anything to check it; though some are known to put one or more pewter dishes into it for that purpose; or, it may be broke into several other tubs, where, by its shallow lying, its fury will be abated. Others again, to make drink work that is backward, will take the whites of two eggs, and beat them up with half a quartern of good brandy, and put it either into the working-vat, or into the cask, which will quickly bring it forward, if a warm cloth is put over the bung. Others tie up bran in a coarse thin cloth, and put it into the vat, where, by its spongy nature, it absorbs a quantity of the drink, and breeds a heat to forward its working.\nSome brewers take off all the top-yeast first, and then, by a peg near the bottom of the working-tub, draw off the beer or ale, so that the dregs are by this means left behind. This is very right, in ales that are to be drank soon; but in beers, that are to lie nine or twelve months in a butt or other cask, there certainly will be wanted some faces or sediments for the beer to feed on, else it must consequently grow hungry, sharp, and eager; and therefore, if its own top or bottom are not put into a cask with the beer, some other artificial composition, or lee, should supply its place, that is wholesome, and will better feed with such drink, than its own natural settlement; and therefore, there are here inserted several receipts for answering this end.\n\nOf artificial Lees for Stout or Stale Beer to feed on.\n\nThis article is of very great importance in the curing of our malt-liquors. The general misfortune of the porter or keeping-beers drinking hard and harsh, is partly owing to the nasty foul feces that lie at the bottom of the cask, compounded of the sediments of malt, hops, and yeast. Wheat is, by many, put into such beer to feed and preserve it, as being reckoned a substantial alkali; however, it has been proved, that such wheat in about three years time has eaten into the very wood of the cask. Others hang a bag of wheat in the vessel, that it may not touch the bottom; but, in both cases, the wheat is discovered to absorb and collect the acid qualities of the beer, yeast, and hop. Hence it is, that such whole wheat is loaded with the qualities of the unwholesome settlements or grounds of the beer, and becomes of such a corroding nature, as to do mischief; and, for that reason, some hang a bag of the flour of malted oats, wheat, peas, or beans, in the vessels of beer, as being of a lighter and mellower body than the whole wheat or its flour, and more natural to the liquor: But whether it be raw wheat or malted, it is supposed, after this receptacle has emitted its alcalous properties to the beer, and taken in all it can of the acid qualities thereof, that such beer will in time prey upon that again, and so communicate its pernicious qualities to the liquor.\n\nComposition for feeding Porter or Keeping-Beers.\n\nTake a quart of French brandy, or as much of English, that is free from any burnt tang, or other ill taste, and is full proof; to this put as much wheat or bean-flour as will knead it into dough, put it in long pieces into the bung-hole, as soon as the beer has done working, or afterwards, and let it gently fall piece by piece to the bottom of the butt; this will maintain the drink in a mellow freshness, keep staleness off for some time, and cause it to be the stronger as it grows aged.\n\nAnother.\n\nTake one pound of treacle, or honey, one pound of the powder of dried oyster-shells, or fat chalk, mix them well, and put it into a butt, as soon as it has done working, or some time after, and bung it well; this will both fine and preserve the beer in a soft, smooth condition for a great while.\n\nAnother.\n\nTake a peck of egg-shells, and dry them in an oven, break and mix them with two pounds of fat chalk, and mix them with water wherein four pounds of coarse sugar have been boiled, and put it into the butt as aforesaid.\n\nTo fine and preserve Beers and Ales, by boiling an Ingredient in the Wort.\n\nIn each barrel-copper of wort, put in two quarts of whole wheat as soon as possible, that it may soak before it boils; then strain it through a sieve, and put the wort in cooling-tubs; thus there will be extracted a gluey consistence, which, being incorporated with the wort by boiling, gives it a more thick and ponderous body, and, when in the cask, soon makes a sediment or lee, as the wort is more or less loaded with the weighty particles of this fizzy body; but if the wheat were first parched, or baked in an oven, it would do better, as being rather too raw as it comes from the ear.\n\nTo stop the Fret in Malt-liquors.\n\nTake a quart of black cherry-brandy, and pour it in at the bung-hole of the hogshead, and stop it close.\n\nTo recover deadish Beer.\n\nWhen strong drink grows flat, by the loss of its spirits, take four or five gallons out of a hogshead, and boil it with five pounds of honey, skim it, and, when cold, put it to the rett, and stop it up close: This will make it pleasant, quick, and strong.\n\nTo make stale Beer drink new.\n\nTake the herb horehound, stamp it and strain it, then put a spoonful of the juice (which is an extreme good pectoral) to a pitcher full of beer, let it stand covered about two hours, and drink it.\n\nTo fine Malt-liquors.\n\nTake a pint of water, half an ounce of unflaked lime, mix them well together; let it stand three hours, and the lime will settle to the bottom, and the water be as clear as glass; pour the water from the sediment, and put it into your ale or beer; mix it with half an ounce of icing-glass, first cut small and boiled; and in five hours time, or less, the beer in the barrel will settle and be clear.\n\nReceipt for making Balls for fining, feeding, preserving, relishing, and colouring Malt Drinks, Wines, and Cyders.\n\nBrown Balls.\n\nAlabaster, or marble calcined into a powder, two pounds. Oyster-shells, a little calcined and freed from their brown or dirt-coloured outside, one pound. Pure fat chalk, well dried, one pound. Horse-bean flour, first freed from the hulls, one pound. Red saunders, four ounces. Grains of paradise, half an ounce. Florentine orris-root, half an ounce. Coriander-seed, a quarter of an ounce. Cloves, in number six. Hops, half an ounce. The best staple incised icing-glass, two ounces. The first runnings of the molasses, or treacle, two pounds.\nPale Balls,\n\nAre made in the same manner, and with the like quantity of every thing, except a pound or two of fine sugar made into a syrup, instead of the molasses, and omitting the saunders.\n\nN.B. The powders are to be pretty fine, and the balls dried very gradually without heat for the first three or four days upon brown paper laid over a large sieve bottom, and turned often. Afterwards they may be put into the sun, or at a proper distance from the fire, in order to dry them thoroughly; and the quantity of the hops may be augmented, or wholly omitted, at discretion, according as the liquor requires.\n\nPut as much water to your glass as will just cover it, in order to open its body, letting it stand so twelve hours; then add the following infusion to it, and gradually dissolve the whole over a gentle fire.

So likewise, if beer or ale is brewed in hot weather, and put into chalky, gravelly, or sandy cellars, and especially if the windows open to the south, south-east, or south-west, then it is very likely it will not keep long, but be muddy and stale: Therefore, to keep beer in such a cellar, it should be brewed in October, that the drink may have time to cure itself before the hot weather comes on; but, in wet or damp cellars, it is best to brew in March, that the drink may have time to fine and settle before the winter weather is advanced. Now, cellars should have double or treble doors, that the outer one may be shut before the inner one is opened, to keep the air out. If a cellar be kept dry, and have double doors, it is reckoned warm in winter, and cool in summer. But the best of cellars are thought to be those in chalks, gravels, or sands; and particularly in chalks, which are of a drying quality more than any other, and consequently dissipate damps; which contributes much to the good keeping of the drink, for all damp cellars are prejudicial to the preservation of beers and ales, and sooner bring on the rotting of the casks and hoops than the dry ones. Besides, in such inclosed cellars and temperate air, the beers and ales ripen more kindly, are better digested and softened, and drink smoother: But, when the temperature of the air in the cellar is unequal, the drink soon grows stale. Though malt-liquor be truly brewed, yet it is often spoiled in a bad cellar, that occasions such alternate fermentations as to make it thick and sour, though it sometimes happens that after such changes it fines itself again. To prevent these commotions of the beer, some brew their pale malt in March, and their brown in October; because the pale malt, having not so many fiery particles in it as the brown, stands more in need of the summer's weather to ripen it, while the brown fort, being more hard and dry, is better able to defend itself against the winter-colds that will help to smooth its harsh particles; yet, when they happen to be too violent, horse-dung should be laid to the windows as a fortification against them.\n\nSome are of opinion, that October is the best of all other months to brew any sort of malt in, by reason there are so many cold months directly following, that will digest the drink and make it much excel that brewed in March, because such beer will not want that care and watching, as that brewed in March absolutely requires, by often taking out and putting in the vent-peg on change of weather; and, if it is always left out, then it deadens and palls the drink; yet, if due care is not taken in this respect, a thunder or stormy night may mar all, by making the drink ferment and burst the cask; for which reason, as iron hoops are most in fashion at this time, they are certainly the greatest security to the safety of the drink thus exposed; and next to them is the chestnut-hoop; both which will endure a shorter or longer time, as the cellar is more or less dry, and according to the management attending them: The iron hoops generally begin to rust first at the edges, and therefore should be rubbed off, and be kept from wet as much as possible.\n\nOf Cleaning and Sweetening of Casks.\n\nIn case your cask is a butt, then with cold water rinse out the lees clean, and have ready boiling or very hot water, which put in, and, with a long stake and a little birch fastened to its end, scrub the bottom as well as you can: At the same time let there be provided another shorter broom of about a foot and a half long, that with one hand may be so employed in the upper and other parts as to clean the cask well: So in a hogshead, or other smaller vessel, the one-handed short broom may be used with water, or with water, sand, or ashes, and be effectually cleaned; the outside of the cask about the bung-hole should be well walked, lest the yeast, as it works over, carry some of its filth with it.\n\nBut, to sweeten a barrel, kilderkin, firkin, or pin, in the great brewhouses, they put them over the copper-hole.","sp":796,"ep":806},{"h":"BREWING","t":"Hole for a night together, that the steam of the boiling water or wort may penetrate into the wood; this way is such a furious searcher, that unless the cask is new-hooped just before, it will be apt to fall to pieces.\n\nAnother Way.\n\nTake a pottle, or more, of stone-lime, and put it into the cask; on this pour some water, and stop it up directly, shaking it well about.\n\nAnother Way.\n\nTake a long linen rag, and dip it in melted brimstone; light it at the end, and let it hang pendant with the upper part of the rag fastened to the wooden bung; this is a most quick and sure way, and will not only sweeten, but help to fine the drink.\n\nAnother.\n\nOr, to make your cask more pleasant, you may use the vintners way thus: Take four ounces of stone brimstone, one ounce of burnt alum, and two ounces of brandy; melt all these in an earthen pan over hot coals, and dip therein a piece of new canvas, and instantly sprinkle thereon the powders of nutmegs, cloves, coriander, and anise seeds; this canvas set on fire, and let it burn hanging in the cask fastened at the end with the wooden bung, so that no smoke comes out.\n\nFor a muddy Cask.\n\nBoil some pepper in water, and fill the cask with it scalding hot.\n\nTo prepare a new Vessel to keep Malt liquors in.\n\nA new vessel is most improperly used by some ignorant people for strong drink, after only once or twice scalding with water; which is so wrong, that such beer or ale will not fail of tasting thereof for half, if not a whole year afterwards. To prevent this inconvenience, when your brewing is over, put up some water scalding hot, and let it run through the grains; then boil it and fill up the cask, stop it well, and let it stand till it is cold; do this twice; then take the grounds of strong drink and boil in it green walnut-leaves and new hay or wheat-straw, and put all into the cask, that it be full, and stop it close: After this, use it for small beer half a year together, and then it will be thoroughly sweet and fit for strong drinks.\n\nWine-casks.\n\nThese are the cheapest of all others to furnish a person readily with, as being many of them good casks for malt-liquors, because the sack and white-wine sorts are already seasoned to-hand, and will greatly improve beers and ales that are put in them: But beware of the Rhinish wine casks for strong drinks; for its wood is so tinctured with this sharp wine, that it will hardly ever be free of it; and therefore such cask is best used for small beer: the claret cask will a great deal sooner be brought into a serviceable state for holding strong drink, if it is two or three times scalded with grounds of barrels, and afterwards used for small beer for some time. But to cure a claret-cask of its colour and taste, put a peck of stone-lime into a hoghead, and pour upon it three pails of water; bung immediately with a wood or cork-bung, and shake it well about a quarter of an hour, and let it stand a day and night, and it will bring off the red colour, and alter the taste of the cask very much.","sp":806,"ep":807},{"h":"BRIANCON","t":"a town of Dauphiny, in France, situated about forty-five miles south-east of Grenoble; E. long. 6\u00b0 20', and N. lat. 44\u00b0 50'.","sp":807,"ep":807},{"h":"BRIAR","t":"in botany, the English name of a species of rose.

The parts of a bridge are the piers, the arches; the pavement, or way over for cattle and carriages; the foot-way on each side, for foot passengers; the rail or parapet, which incloses the whole; and the buttments or ends of the bridge on the bank.\n\nThe conditions required in a bridge are, that it be well-designed, commodious, durable, and suitably decorated. The piers of stone-bridges should be equal in number, that there may be one arch in the middle, where commonly the current is strongest; their thickness is not to be less than a sixth part of the span of the arch, nor more than a fourth; they are commonly guarded in the front with angular stonings, to break the force of the current; the strongest arches are those whose sweep is a whole semicircle; as the piers of bridges always diminish the bed of a river, in case of inundations, the bed must be sunk or hollowed in proportion to the space taken up by the piers (as the waters gain in depth what they lose in breadth) which otherwise conduce to wash away the foundation and endanger the piers: To prevent this, they sometimes diminish the current, either by lengthening its course, or by making it more winding; or by stopping the bottom with rows of planks, stakes, or piles, which break the current. It is also required that the foundation of bridges be laid at that season of the year, when the waters are lowest; and if the ground be rocky, hard gravel, or stony, the first stones of the foundation may be laid on the surface; but if the soil be soft sand, it will be necessary to dig till you come to a firm bottom.\n\nAmong the bridges of antiquity, that built by Trajan over the Danube is allowed to be the most magnificent; it was composed of twenty arches, of an hundred and fifty feet in height, and their opening from one pier to another was an hundred and sixty feet: The piers of this fine bridge are still to be seen in the Danube, being erected between Servia and Moldavia; a little above Nicopolis.\n\nAmong modern bridges, that of Westminster, built over the river Thames, may be accounted one of the finest in the world: It is forty-four feet wide, a commodious foot-way being allowed for passengers, on each side, of about seven feet broad, raised above the road allowed for carriages, and paved with broad moor-stones, while the space left between them is sufficient to admit three carriages and two horses to go abreast, without any danger. Its extent from wharf to wharf is 1220 or 1223 feet, being full three hundred feet longer than London-bridge. The free water-way under the arches of this bridge is eight hundred and seventy feet, being four times as much as the free water-way left between the stonings of London-bridge: This disposition, together with the gentleness of the stream, are the chief reasons why no sensible fall of water can ever stop, or in the least endanger the smallest boats in their passage through the arches.\n\nIt consists of thirteen large and two small arches, together with fourteen intermediate piers.\n\nEach pier terminates with a salient right angle against either stream: the two middle piers are each seventeen feet in thickness at the springing of the arches, and contain three thousand cubic feet, or near two hundred tons of solid stone; and the others decrease in width equally on each side by one foot.\n\nAll the arches of this bridge are semicircular; they all spring from about two feet above low-water mark; the middle arch is seventy-five feet wide, and the others decrease in breadth equally on each side by four feet.\n\nThis bridge is built of the best materials; and the size and disposition of these materials are such, that there is no false bearing, or so much as a false joint in the whole structure; besides that, it is built in a neat and elegant taste, and with such simplicity and grandeur, that, whether viewed from the water, or by the passengers who walk over it, it fills the mind with an agreeable surprize. The semioctangular towers, which form the recesses of the foot-way, the manner of placing the lamps, and the height of the balustrade, are at once the most beautiful, and, in every other respect, the best contrived.\n\nBut the most singular bridge in Europe is that built over the river Tawe in Glamorganshire. It consists of one stupendous arch, the diameter of which is 175 feet, the chord 140, the altitude 35, and the abutments 32. This magnificent arch was built by William Edward, a poor country-mason, in the year 1756.\n\nBridges are either built of stone or timber, as is judged most convenient.\n\nStone-Bridges consist of piers, arches, and buttments, made of hewn stone, sometimes also intermixed with bricks.\n\nWooden-Bridges are composed of beams and joists, supported by punchions, well cramped and bound together.\n\nRushen-Bridges are made of great bundles of rushes, bound fast together, over which planks are laid, and fastened: these are put over marshy places, to serve for a crossing ground.\n\nPendent or hanging-Bridges, called also philosophical bridges, are those not supported by posts or pillars, but hung at large in the air, sustained only at the two ends or buttments.\n\nDraw-Bridge, one that is fastened with hinges at one end only, so that the other may be drawn up; in which case, the bridge stands upright, to hinder the passage of a ditch or moat.\n\nFlying or floating Bridge, is generally made of two small bridges, laid one over the other in such a manner, that the uppermost stretches and runs out, by help of certain cords, running through pulleys placed along the sides of the under bridge, which push it forwards, till the end of it joins the place it is intended to be fixed on.\nBridge of boats, boats made of copper, and joined side by side, till they reach across a river, which being covered with planks, are fastened with stakes or anchors.\n\nBridge of communication is that made over a river, by which two armies, or forts, which are separated by that river, have a free communication with one another.\n\nFloating Bridge, a bridge made use of, in form of a work in fortification, called a redoubt, consisting of two boats, covered with planks, which are solidly framed, so as to bear either horse or cannon.\n\nBridge, in gunnery, the two pieces of timber which go between the two transoms of a gun-carriage, on which the bed rests.\n\nBridge, in music, a term for that part of a stringed instrument over which the strings are stretched.

They had also other bricks, just half each of those, to render their works more solid, and also more agreeable to the sight, by the diversities of the figures and sizes of the bricks.\n\nPliny says, that to make good bricks they must not consist of any earth that is full of sand or gravel, nor of such as is gritty or stony; but of a greyish meal, or whitish chalky clay, or at least of a reddish earth: He also adds, that the best season for making bricks is the spring; because, if made in summer, they will\nBricks, among us, are various, according to their various forms, dimensions, uses, method of making, &c., the principal of which are, Compass-bricks, of a circular form, used in fletching of walls; Concave, or hollow bricks, on one side flat like a common brick, on the other hollowed, and used for conveyance of water; Feather-edged bricks, which are like common flue bricks, only thinner on one edge than the other, and used for penning up the brick panels in timber buildings; Cogging bricks are used for making the indented works under the caping of walls built with great bricks; Caping bricks, formed for purpose for caping of walls; Dutch or Flemish bricks, used to pave yards, stables, and for soap-boilers vaults and cisterns; Clinkers, such bricks as are glazed by the heat of the fire in making; Sandel or famel-bricks, are such as lie outmost in a kiln, or clamp, and consequently are soft and useless, as not being thoroughly burnt; Great bricks are those twelve inches long, six broad, and three thick, used to build fence-walls; Plaster or buttress bricks, have a notch at one end, half the breadth of the brick; their use is to bind the work which is built of great bricks; Statute-bricks or small common bricks, ought, when burnt, to be nine inches long, four and a quarter broad, and two and a half thick; they are commonly used in paving cellars, sinks, hearths, &c.\n\nBricks are burnt either in a kiln or clamp. Those that are burnt in a kiln, are first set or placed in it, and then the kiln being covered with pieces of bricks, they put in some wood to dry them with a gentle fire; and this they continue till the bricks are pretty dry, which is known by the smoke's turning from a darkish colour to a transparent smoke; They then leave off putting in wood, and proceed to make ready for burning, which is performed by putting in brugh, furze, spray, heath, brake, or fern-faggots; but before they put in any faggots, they dam up the mouth or mouths of the kiln with pieces of bricks (which they call shinlogs) piled up one upon another, and close it up with wet brick-earth, instead of mortar.\n\nThe shinlog they make so high, that there is but just room above it to thrust in a faggot; then they proceed to put in more faggots, till the kiln and its arches look white, and the fire appears at the top of the kiln; upon which they slacken the fire for an hour, and let all cool by degrees. This they continue to do, alternately heating and slackening, till the ware be thoroughly burnt, which is usually effected in forty-eight hours.\n\nAbout London they chiefly burn in clamps, built of the bricks themselves, after the manner of arches in kilns, with a vacancy between each brick, for the fire to play through; but with this difference, that instead of arching, they span it over by making the bricks project one over another on both sides of the place, for the wood and coals to lie in till they meet, and are bounded by the bricks at the top, which close all up.\n\nThe place for the fuel is carried up straight on both sides, till about three feet high; then they almost fill it with wood, and over that lay a covering of sea-coal, and then overspan the arch; but they strew sea-coal also over the clamp, betwixt all the rows of bricks; lastly, they kindle the wood, which gives fire to the coal; and when all is burnt, then they conclude the bricks are sufficiently burnt.\n\nOil of Bricks, olive oil imbibed by the substance of bricks, and afterwards distilled from it.

The waters of Bath are the first, Buxton the second, and Matlock the third.\n\nBath waters are beneficial, when the secretions from the blood are diminished; Bristol, when too much increased: Bath attenuates powerfully; Bristol incrassates: Bath is spirituous, and helps defects; Bristol is more cooling, and suppresses plenitude, with its consequences, inflammations and hemorrhages.\n\nIf we may judge of the contents of Bristol waters, from their effects, which are exceedingly defensive and healing; they partake chiefly of chalk, lapis calcarius, and calaminaris, the virtues of which are too dry to cleanse; they fill ulcers with flesh, and cicatrize them.\n\nBut whatever the substances are that impregnate them, it is plain they are very subtile, and that there is but little of a terrestrial part in them, from their specific lightness above other waters: Yet when we consider how agreeable to the sight, smell and taste; how clear, pure and soft they are; their gentle degree of heat, so adapted to sundry diseases; it must be concluded, that those waters do imbibe some salutary particles in their passage through the earth; and, from the many cures yearly wrought by them, that they have an undoubted title to a place in the first class of medicinal waters.\n\nThe diseases in which Bristol waters are properly prescribed, are internal hemorrhages and inflammations, blood-spitting, dysentery, and immoderate flux of the menses, purulent ulcers of the viscera: Hence, in consumptions, the dropfy, scurvy with heat, stone, gravel, strangury; the habitual gout, scorbutic rheumatism, diabetes, slow fevers, atrophy, pox, cancer, gleets in both sexes, king's evil, &c.; in all these disorders, Bath waters are not only improper, but hurtful; they rouse the too languid, and quicken the too lazy circulation; they allay the heat, and restrain the too rapid motion of the blood. Those impregnate the phlegmatic, these temperate the choleric constitution. Bath water seems to be adapted to the maladies of the stomach, guts, and nerves; Bristol, to those of the lungs, kidneys, and bladder: Again, Bath waters are at variance with a milk course; and the Bristol can never be judiciously directed, but when they may be joined with reason and success.\nThe Bristol waters are taken medicinally only during the hot months, as from April to September.\n\n**Bristol-flower**, in botany, a name sometimes given to the lichen.

Its design is to loosen, and carry off, by the help of alkaline lixives or lyes, that particular substance in cloth, which is the cause of its brown colour.\n\nAll ashes used in lye, the pearl excepted, ought to be well pounded, before they are put into the copper; for the Maricot and Calshub are very hard, and with some difficulty yield their salts. As these two last contain a very considerable proportion of a real sulphureous matter, which must in some degree tinge white cloth; and as this is dissolved much more by boiling, than by the inferior degrees of heat, while the salts may be as well extracted by the latter. The water should never be brought to boil, and should be continued for some time longer under that degree of heat. The pearl-ashes should never be put in till near the end, as they are easily dissolved in water.\n\nIf the salts were always of an equal strength, the same quantities would make a lye equally strong; but they are not. Salts of the same name differ very much from one another. The Muscovy ashes are turning weaker every day, as every bleacher must have observed, till at last they turn quite effete. A decoction from them when new, must differ very much from one when they have been long kept. Hence a necessity of some exact criterion to discover when lyes are of an equal strength. The taste cannot serve, as that is so variable, cannot be described to another, and is blunted by repeated trials. The proof-ball will serve the purpose of the bleachfield sufficiently; and, by discovering the specific gravity, will show the quantity of alkaline salts dissolved. But it cannot show the dangerous qualities of these salts; for the less caustic and less heavy this liquor is, the more dangerous and corrosive it may be for the cloth.\n\nThe third lye, which they draw from these materials by an infusion of cold water, in which the taste of lime is discoverable, appears plainly to be more dangerous than the first. The second lye, which they extract from the same ashes, and which is reckoned about a third in strength, when compared to the first, must be of the same nature; nor should it be used without an addition of pearl-ashes, which will correct it.\n\nIt is taken for a general rule, that the solution of any body in its menstruum is equally diffused through the whole liquor. The bleachers depending on this, use equal quantities of the top and bottom of their lye, when once clear and settled; taking it for granted, that there is an equal quantity of salts in equal quantities of the lye. But if there is not, the mistake may be of fatal consequence, as the lye may be in some places stronger than what the cloth can with safety bear. That general law of solution must have taken its rise from particular experiments, and not from reasoning. Whether a sufficient number of experiments have been tried to ascertain this point, and to establish an undoubted general rule, may be called in question.\n\n\"But,\" says Dr Home, \"when I had discovered that lime makes part of the dissolved substance, and reflected how long its grosser parts will continue suspended in water, there appeared stronger reasons for suspecting that this rule, though it may be pretty general, does not take place here; at least it is worth the pursuit of experiment.\"\n\n\"I weighed at the bleachfield a piece of glass in some cold lye, after it had been boiled, stood for two days, and about the fourth part of it had been used. The glass weighed 3 drachms 1\u00bd grains in the lye, and 3 drachms 7\u00bd grains in river-water. The same glass weighed in the same lye, when almost all used, 2 grains less than it had done before. This shows, that the last of the lye contained a third more of the dissolved body; and, consequently, was a third stronger than the first of the lye.\n\n\"As this might, perhaps, be owing to a continuation of the solution of the salts, I repeated the experiment in a different way.\n\n\"I took from the surface some of the lye, after the salts were dissolved, and the liquor was become clear. At the same time I immersed a bottle, fixed to a long stick, so near the bottom, as not to raise the ashes there, and, by pulling out the cork by a string, filled the bottle full of the lye near the bottom. The glass weighed in river-water 3 drachms 38\u00bd grains; in the lye taken from the surface 3 drachms 34\u00bd grains; and in the lye taken from the bottom 3 drachms 31\u00bd grains. This experiment shows, that the lye at the bottom was, in this case, \u00bd stronger than the lye at the surface.\n\n\"At other times when I tried the same experiment, I found no difference in the specific gravity; and therefore, I leave it as a question yet doubtful, though deserving to be ascertained by those who have an opportunity of doing it. As the lye stands continually on the ashes, there can be no doubt but what is used last must be stronger than the first. I would, therefore, recommend, to general practice, the method used by Mr John Christie, who draws off the lye, after it has settled, into a second receptacle, and leaves the ashes behind. By this means it never can turn stronger; and he has it in his power to mix the top and bottom, which cannot be done so long as it stands on the ashes.\"\n\nHaving considered the lye, let us next inquire how it acts. On this inquiry depends almost the whole theory of bleaching, as its action on cloth is, at least in this country, absolutely necessary. It is found by experiment, that one effect they have on cloth, is the diminishing of its weight; and that their whitening power is, generally, in proportion to their weakening power. Hence arises a probability, that these lyes act by removing somewhat from the cloth, and that the loss of this substance is the cause of whitening. This appears yet plainer, when the bucking, which lasts from Saturday night to Monday morning is attended to.\n\nThere are various and different opinions with regard to the operation of these salts: That they act by altering the external texture of the cloth, or by separating the mucilaginous parts from the rest, or by extracting the oil which is laid up in the cells of the plant. The last is the general opinion, or rather conjecture, for none of them deserves any better name; but may we venture to affirm, that it is so without any better title to pre-eminence,\nnence, than what the others have. Alkaline salts dissolve oils; therefore these salts dissolve the cellular oil of the cloth, is all the foundation which this theory has to rest on; too slight, when unsupported by experiment, to be relied on.\n\nDr Home endeavours to settle this question by the following experiments and observations.\n\n\"Wax, says he, is whitened by being exposed to the influence of the sun, air, and moisture. A discovery of the changes made on it by bleaching, may throw a light upon the question.\n\n\"Six drachms of wax were sliced down, exposed on a south window, Sept. 10, and watered. That day being clear and warm, bleached the wax more than all the following. It seemed to me to whiten quicker when it had no water thrown on it, than when it had. Sept. 15, it was very white, and 1 drachm 3 grains lighter. 3\u00bd drachms of this bleached wax, and as much of unbleached, taken from the same piece, were made into two candles of the same length and thickness, having cotton wicks of the same kind. The bleached candle burned one hour thirty-three minutes; the unbleached three minutes longer. The former run down four times, the latter never. The former had an obscure light and dull flame; the latter had a clear pleasant one, of a blue colour at the bottom. The former when burning seemed to have its wick thicker, and its flame nearer the wax, than the latter. The former was brittle, the latter not. It plainly appears from these facts, that the unbleached wax was more inflammable than the bleached; and that the latter had lost so much of an inflammable substance, as it had lost in weight; and consequently the substance lost in bleaching of wax is the oily part.\n\n\"As I had not an opportunity of repeating the former experiment, I do not look on it as entirely conclusive; for it is possible that some of the dust, flying about in the air, might have mixed with the bleached wax, and so have rendered it less inflammable. Nor do I think the analogical reasoning from wax to linen without objections. Let us try then if we cannot procure the substance extracted from the cloth, show it to the eye, and examine its different properties. The proper place to find it, is in a lye already used, and fully impregnated with these colouring particles.\n\n\"I got in the bleachfield some lye, which had been used all that day for boiling coarse linen, which was tolerably white, and had been twice boiled before. There could be no dressing remaining in these webs. No soap had ever touched that parcel; nor do they mix soap with the lye used for coarse cloth. Some of this impregnated lye was evaporated, and left a dark-coloured matter behind. This substance felt oily betwixt the fingers, but would not lather in water as soap does. It deflagrated with nitre in fusion, and afforded a tincture to spirit of wine. By this experiment the salts seem to have an oily inflammable substance joined with them.\n\n\"Could we separate this colouring substance from these salts, and exhibit it by itself so that it might become the object of experiment, the question would be soon decided. Here chymistry lends us its assistance. Whatever has a stronger affinity or attraction to the salts with which it is joined, than this substance has, must set it at liberty, and make it visible. Acids attract alkaline salt from all other bodies; and therefore will serve our purpose.\n\n\"Into a quantity of the impregnated lye mentioned in the former experiment, I poured in oil of vitriol. Some bubbles of air arose, an intestine motion was to be perceived, and the liquor changed its colour from a dark to a turbid white. It curdled like a solution of soap, and a scum soon gathered on the surface, about half an inch in thickness, the deepness of the liquor not being above six inches. What was below was now pretty clear. A great deal of the same matter lay in the bottom; and I observed, that the substance on the surface was precipitated, and showed itself heavier than water, when the particles of air, attached to it in great plenty, were dispelled by heat. This substance was in colour darker than the cloth which had been boiled in it.\n\n\"I procured a considerable quantity of it by skimming it off. When I tried to mix it with water, it always fell to the bottom. When dried by the air, it diminished very much in its size, and turned as black as a coal. In this state it deflagrated strongly with nitre in fusion; gave a strong tincture to spirit of wine; and when put on a red-hot iron, burnt very slowly, as if it contained a heavy ponderous oil; and left some earth behind.\n\n\"From the inflammability of this substance, its rejecting of water, and dissolving in spirit of wine, we discover its oleaginous nature; but from its great specific gravity we see that it differs very much from the expressed or cellular oil of vegetables; and yet more from their mucilage. That it dissolves in spirit of wine, is not a certain argument of its differing from expressed oils; because these, when joined to alkaline salts, and recovered again by acids, become soluble in spirit of wine. The quantity of earthy powder left behind after burning, shows that it contains many of the solid particles of the flax. The substance extracted from cloth by alkaline lyes appears then to be a composition of a heavy oil, and the solid earthy particles of the flax.\n\n\"In what manner these salts act so as to dissolve the oils, and detach the solid particles, is uncertain; but we see evidently how much cloth must be weakened by an improper use of them, as we find the solid particles themselves are separated.\"\n\nIt is necessary that cloth should be dry before bucking, that the salts may enter into the body of the cloth along with the water; for they will not enter in such quantity, if it be wet; and by acting too powerfully on the external threads, may endanger them.\n\nThe degree of heat is a very material circumstance in this operation. As the action of the salts is always in proportion to the heat, it would appear more proper to begin with a boiling heat, by which a great deal of time and labour might be saved. The reason why this method is not followed, appears to be this. If any vegetable or vegetable substance is to be softened, and to have its juices extracted, it is found more proper to give it gentle degrees of heat at first, and to advance gradually, than to plunge it all at once in boiling water. This last degree of heat is so strong, that when applied at once to a vegetable, it hardens, instead of softening its texture. Dried vegetables\nvegetables are immediately put into boiling water by cooks, that these substances may preserve their green colour, which is only to be done by hindering them from turning too soft. Boiling water has the same effect on animal substances; for if salt beef is put into it, the water is kept from getting at the salts, from the outside of the beef being hardened.\n\nBut when we consider, how much of an oily substance there is in the cloth, especially at first, which will for some time keep off the water, and how the twisting of the threads, and closeness of the texture, hinders the water from penetrating, we shall find, that if boiling water were put on it at once, the cloth might be liable, in several parts, to a dry heat, which would be much worse than a wet one. That the lyes have not access to all parts of the cloth, at first, appears plainly from this, that when it has lain, after the first bucking, till all the lyes are washed out, it is as black, in some parts, as when it was steeped. This must be owing to the discharge of the colouring particles from those places to which the lye has access, and to their remaining where it has not. It would seem adviseable, then, in the first bucking or two, when the cloth is foul, to use the lye considerably below the boiling point; that by this soaking or maceration, the foulness may be entirely discharged, and the cloth quite opened for the speedy reception of the boiling lye in the buckings which follow.\n\nThe lyes should likewise be weakest in the first buckings, because then they act only on the more external parts; whereas, when the cloth is more opened, and the field of action is increased, the active powers ought to be so too. For this reason they are at the strongest after some sourings.\n\nThe only thing that now remains to be considered, is, the management of the coarse cloth, where boiling is substituted in place of bucking. This species of linen cannot afford the time and labour necessary for the latter operation; and therefore they must undergo a shorter, and more active method. As the heat continues longer at the degree of boiling, the lyes used to the coarse cloth must be weaker than those used to the fine. There is not so much danger from heat in the coarse as in the fine cloth, because the former is of a more open texture, and will allow the lye to penetrate more speedily. In the closer kinds, however, the first application of the salts should be made without a boiling heat.\n\n**ALTERNATE WATERING AND DRYING.**\n\nAfter the cloth has been bucked, it is carried out to the field, and frequently watered for the first six hours. For if during that time, when it is strongly impregnated with salts, it is allowed to dry, the salts approaching closer together, and, assisted by a greater degree of heat, increasing always in proportion to the driest of the cloth, act with greater force, and destroy its very texture. After this time, dry spots are allowed to appear before it gets any water. In this state it profits most, as the latter part of the evaporation comes from the more internal parts of the cloth, and will carry away most from those parts. The bleaching of the wax, in a preceding experiment, helps to confirm this; for it seemed to whiten most when the last particles of water were going off.\n\nThis continual evaporation from the surface of the cloth shows, that the design of the operation is to carry off somewhat remaining after the former process of bucking. This appears likewise from a fact known to all bleachers, that the upper side of cloth, where the evaporation is strongest, attains to a greater degree of whiteness than the under side. But it is placed beyond all doubt by experiment, which shews, that cloth turns much lighter by being exposed to the influence of the sun, air, and winds, even though the salts have been washed out of it.\n\nWhat, then, is this substance? As we have discovered in the former section, that the whitening, in the operation of bucking, depends on the extracting or loosening the heavy oil, and solid particles of the flax; it appears highly probable, that the effects of watering, and exposition to the sun, air, and winds, are produced by the evaporation of the same substance, joined to the salts, with which composite body the cloth is impregnated when exposed on the field. That these salts are in a great measure carried off or destroyed, appears from the cloth's being allowed to dry without any danger, after the evaporation has gone on for some time. \"If we can show, says Dr Home, that oils and salts, when joined together, are capable of being exhaled, in this manner, by the heat of the atmosphere, we shall reduce this question to a very great degree of certainty.\"\n\n\"Sept. 10. I exposed, in a south-west window, half an oz. of Cattle soap, sliced down, and watered. Sept. 14. When well dried, it weighed but 3 dr. 6 gr. Sept. 22. It weighed 2 dr. 2 gr. Sept. 24. It weighed 1 dr. 50 gr. It then seemed a very little whiter; but was much more mucilaginous in its taste, and had no degree of tartness, which it had before.\n\n\"It appears from this experiment, that soap is so volatile, when watered, and exposed to air not very warm, that it loses above the half its weight in fourteen days. The same must happen to the saponaceous substance, formed from the conjunction of the alkaline salts, heavy oil, and earthy particles of the flax. The whole design, then, of this operation, which, by way of pre-eminence, gets the name of bleaching, is to carry off, by the evaporation of water, whatever has been loosened by the former process of bucking.\n\n\"Against this doctrine there may be brought two objections, seemingly of great weight. It is a general opinion amongst bleachers, that linen whitens quicker in March and April, than in any other months: But as the evaporation cannot be so great at that time, as when the sun has a greater heat; hence the whitening of cloth is not in proportion to the degree of evaporation; and therefore the former cannot be owing to the latter. This objection vanishes, when we consider, that the cloth which comes first into the bleachfield, in the spring, is closely attended, having no other to interfere with it for some time; and, as it is the whitest, gets, in the after buckings, the first of the lye; while the second parcel is often bucked with what has been used to the first. Were the fact true, on which the objection is founded, this would...\"\nbe a sufficient answer to the objection. But it appears not to be true, from an observation of Mr. John Christie. That cloth laid down in the beginning of June, and finished in September, takes generally less work, and undergoes fewer operations, than what is laid down in March, and finished in June.\n\n\"The other objection is, That cloth dries much faster in windy weather than in calm sunshine; but it does not bleach so fast. This would seem to show, that the sun has some particular influence independent on evaporation. In answer to this objection, let it be considered, that it is not the evaporation from the surface, but from the more internal parts that is of benefit to the cloth. Now, this latter evaporation must be much stronger in sunshine than in windy weather, on account of the heat of the sun, which will make the cloth more open; while the coldness of windy weather must shut it up, so that the evaporation will all be from the surface. Clear sunshine, with a very little wind, is observed to be the best weather for bleaching; a convincing proof that this reasoning is just.\n\n\"It would seem to follow as a corollary from this reasoning, that the number of waterings should in general be in proportion to the strength of the lye; for the stronger the lye is, the more there is to be evaporated; and the greater the danger, in case the cloth should be allowed to dry. But there is an exception to this general rule, arising from the consideration of another circumstance. It is observed, that cloth, when brown, dries sooner than when it becomes whiter, arising from the clovenefs and oiliness which it then has, not allowing the water a free passage. Perhaps that colour may retain a greater degree of heat, and in that way assist a very little. Cloth therefore, after the first buckings, must be more carefully watered than after the last.\n\n\"It follows likewise from this reasoning, that the soil of the bleachfield should be gravelly or sandy, that the water may pass quickly through it, and that the heat may be increased by the reflection of the soil; for the success of this operation depends on the mutual action of heat and evaporation. It is likewise necessary that the water should be light, soft, and free from mud or dirt, which, not being able to rise along with the water, must remain behind. When there is much of this, it becomes necessary to rinse the cloth in water, and then give it a milling, to take out the dirt; else it would be fixed in the cloth by the following bucking, as it is not soluble by the lye.\n\n\"This operation has more attributed to it by bleachers than it can justly claim. The cloth appears, even to the eye, to whiten under these alternate waterings and dryings; and these naturally get the honour of it, when it more properly belongs to the former operation. Here lies the fallacy. Alkaline salts give a very high colour to the decoctions, or infusion of vegetables. This is probably owing to the solution of the oleaginous colouring particles of the plant; which particles, being opened and separated by the salts, occupy a greater space, and give a deep colour to the liquor. The cloth participates of the liquor and colour. Hence bleachers always judge of the goodness of the bucking by the deepness of its colour. The rule, in general, is good. I observe, that in those buckings which continue from the Saturday night to the Monday morning, the cloth has always the deepest colour. When that cloth has been exposed some hours to the influence of the air, these colouring particles, which are but loosely attached to it, are evaporated, and the linen appears of a brighter colour. This operation does no more than complete what the former had almost finished. If its own merit were thoroughly known, there would be no occasion to attribute that of another operation to it. Thread, and open cloths, such as diaper, may be reduced to a great degree of whiteness, after one bucking, by it alone. No cloth, as would appear, can attain to a bright whiteness without it.\n\n\"Since the only advantage of watering is the removal of the salts, and what they have dissolved, might we not effectuate this by some cheaper, and more certain method? For it occupies many hands; and must depend altogether on the uncertainty of the weather; so that, in the beginning of the season, the bleacher is often obliged to repeat his buckings without bleaching. We might take out the alkaline salts by acids; but then the other substance would be left alone in the cloth, nor would any washing be able to remove it. Mill-washing appears a more probable method of taking out both salts and oils; and it would seem that this might, in a great measure, supply the place of watering; but upon trial it does not succeed. Two parcels of linen were managed equally in every other respect, except in this, that one was watered, and exposed to the influence of the air, and the other was only mill-washed. This method was followed until they were fit for scouring. The cloth which had been mill-washed, had a remarkable green colour, and did not recover the bright colour of the pieces managed in the common way, until it had been treated like them for a fortnight. The green colour was certainly owing to a precipitation of the sulphureous particles, with which the lye is impregnated, upon the surface of the cloth; owing to the salts being washed off more speedily than the sulphur, to which they are united in the lye. The attachment between these two bodies we know is very loose, and the separation easily made. Evaporation then alone is sufficient to carry off these sulphureous particles.\"","sp":671,"ep":675},{"h":"BUCKLE","t":"a well known utensil, made of divers sorts of metals, as gold, silver, steel, brass, &c.\n\nThe fashion or form of buckles is various; but their use, in general, is to make fast certain parts of dress, as the shoes, garters, &c.\n\nBuckles for girdles pay a duty of 3s. 10\u00bdd. the gros, or twelve dozen; whereof 1s. 4\u00bdd. is drawn back on exportation.

Nor are we to wonder, that the ancient Greeks and Romans were extremely solicitous about the interment of their deceased friends, since they were strongly persuaded, that their souls could not be admitted into the Elysian fields till their bodies were committed to the earth; and if it happened that they never obtained the rites of burial, they were excluded from the happy mansions for the term of an hundred years. For this reason it was considered as a duty incumbent upon all travellers who should meet with a dead body in their way, to cast dust or mould upon it three times, and of these three handfuls, one at least was cast upon the head. The ancients likewise considered it as a great misfortune if they were not laid in the sepulchres of their fathers; for which reason, such as died in foreign countries had usually their ashes brought home, and interred with those of their ancestors. But notwithstanding their great care in the burial of the dead, there were some persons whom they thought unworthy of that office, and to whom therefore they refused it: Such were, 1. Public or private enemies. 2. Such as betrayed, or conspired against their country. 3. Tyrants, who were always looked upon as enemies to their country. 4. Villains guilty of sacrilege. 5. Such as died in debt, whose bodies belonged to their creditors. And, 6. Some particular offenders, who suffered capital punishment.\n\nOf those who were allowed the rites of burial, some were distinguished by particular circumstances of disgrace attending their interment: Thus persons killed by lightning were buried apart by themselves, being thought odious to the gods; those who wasted their patrimony, forfeited the right of being buried in the sepulchres of their fathers; and those who were guilty of\nof self-murder were privately deposited in the ground, without the accustomed solemnities. Among the Jews, the privilege of burial was denied only to self-murderers, who were thrown out to rot upon the ground. In the Christian church, though good men always desired the privilege of internment, yet they were not, like the heathens, so concerned for their bodies, as to think it any detriment to them, if either the barbarity of an enemy, or some other accident, deprived them of this privilege. The primitive Christian church denied the more solemn rites of burial only to unbaptized persons, self-murderers, and excommunicated persons who continued obdurate and impenitent, in a manifest contempt of the church's censures.\n\nThe place of burial among the Jews was never particularly determined. We find they had graves in the town and country, upon the highways, in gardens, and upon mountains. Among the Greeks, the temples were made repositories for the dead in the primitive ages; yet the general custom in latter ages, with them, as well as with the Romans and other heathen nations, was to bury their dead without their cities, and chiefly by the highways. Among the primitive Christians, burying in cities was not allowed for the first three hundred years, nor in churches for many ages after, the dead bodies being first deposited in the atrium or church-yard, and porches and porticos of the church: hereditary burying-places were forbidden till the 12th century.

A grave subject, in which there is no impropriety, may be brought down by a certain colouring so as to be risible, as in Virgil Travellie; the author first laughs at every turn, in order to make his readers laugh. The Lutrin is a burlesque poem of the other sort, laying hold of a low and trifling incident to expose the luxury, indolence, and contentious spirit of a set of monks. Boileau, the author, turns the subject into ridicule by dressing it in the heroic style; and affecting to consider it as of the utmost dignity and importance. Though ridicule is the poet's aim, he always carries a grave face, and never once bewrays a smile. The opposition between the subject and the manner of handling it, is what produces the ridicule; and therefore, in a composition of this kind, no image professedly ludicrous ought to have quarter, because such images destroy the contrast.\n\nThough the burlesque that aims at ridicule, produces its effects by elevating the style far above the subject, yet the poet ought to confine himself to such images as are lively, and readily apprehended. A strained elevation, soaring above the ordinary reach of fancy, makes not a pleasant impression. The mind is soon disgusted by being kept long on the stretch. Machinery may be employed in a burlesque poem, such as the Lutrin, the Dispensary, or Hudibras, with more success and propriety than in any other species of poetry. For burlesque poems, though they assume the air of history, give entertainment chiefly by their pleasant and ludicrous pictures: It is not the aim of such a poem to raise sympathy; and for that reason, a strict imitation of nature is not necessary.

The second reason is, that the soul, being separated from the gross and unactive matter, might be at liberty to take its flight into heaven. The body was rarely burnt without company, for besides the various animals they threw upon the pile, we seldom find a man of quality consumed without a number of slaves and captives, which, in barbarous times, they used to murder for that purpose: and in some parts of the East Indies it is customary, at this day, for wives to throw themselves into the funeral pile with their deceased husbands. At the funerals of emperors, generals, &c., who had their arms burnt with them, the soldiers made procession three times round the funeral pile with shouts and trumpets, to express their respect to the dead. During the burning also, the dead person's friends stood by, called on the deceased, and poured out libations of wine, with which, when the pile was burnt down, they extinguished the remains of the fire; and having collected the bones of the deceased, washed them with wine, and anointed them with oil. When the bones were discovered, they gathered the ashes that lay close to them, and both were reposited in urns, either of wood, stone, earth, silver, or gold, according to the quality of the deceased.

Those who suppose it no more than an angel, seem to imply that it would be a diminution of the majesty of God, to appear upon every occasion, especially when he has such a number of celestial ministers, who may do the business as well. But considering that God is present everywhere, the notification of his presence by some outward sign in one determinate place, (which is all we mean by his appearance), is in our conception less laborious (if anything laborious could be conceived of God) than a delegation of angels upon every turn from heaven, and seems in the main to illustrate rather than debauch the glory of his nature and existence. But however this be, it is plain that the angel here spoken of was no created being, from the whole context, and especially from his saying, \"I am the Lord God, the Jehovah,\" &c. since this is not the language of angels, who are always known to express themselves in such humble terms as these, \"I am sent from God; I am thy fellow-servant,\" &c. It is a vain pretence to say, that an angel, as God's ambassador, may speak in God's name and person; for what ambassador of any prince ever yet said, \"I am the king?\" Since therefore no angel, without the guilt of blasphemy, could assume these titles; and since neither God the Father, nor the Holy Ghost, are ever called by the name of angel, i.e. a messenger, or person sent, whereas God the Son is called by the prophet Malachi, (chap. iii. 1.), \"The angel of the covenant;\" it hence seems to follow, that this angel of the Lord was God the Son, who might very properly be called an angel, because in the fulness of time he was sent into the world in our flesh, as a messenger from God, and might therefore make these his temporary apparitions, presages and forerunners, as it were, of his more solemn mission.\n\nThe Mahometans believe, that one of Moses's shoes, put off by him as he drew near the burning bush, was placed in the ark of the covenant, in order to preserve the memory of this miracle.","sp":826,"ep":826},{"h":"BUSHEL","t":"a measure of capacity for dry things, as grain, fruits, dry pulse, &c containing four pecks, or eight gallons, or one-eighth of a quarter.\n\nA bushel, by 12 Henry VII. c. 5. is to contain eight gallons of wheat; the gallon eight pounds of troy-weight; the ounce twenty l\u00e9rings, and the sterling thirty-two grains, or corns of wheat growing in the midst of the ear.\n\nAt Paris, the bushel is divided into two half bushels; the half bushel into two quarts; the quart into two half quarts; the half quart into two litrons; and the litron into two half litrons.

They have a book concerning shamble-constitution; and in case of any difficulty, they apply to some learned rabbi for advice: nor was any allowed to practise this art, without a licence in form; which gave the man, upon evidence of his abilities, a power to kill meat, and others to eat what he killed; provided he carefully read every week for one year, and every month the next year, and once a quarter during his life, the constitution above mentioned. We have some very good laws for the better regulation and preventing the abuses committed by butchers. A butcher that sells swine's flesh mezzled, or dead of the murrain, for the first offence shall be amerced; for the second, have the pillory; for the third, be imprisoned and make fine; and for the fourth, abjure the town. Butchers not selling meat at reasonable prices, shall forfeit double the value, leviable by warrant of two justices of the peace. No butcher shall kill any flesh in his scalding-house, or within the walls of London, on pain to forfeit for every ox so killed, 12d. and for every other beast, 8d. to be divided betwixt the king and the prosecutor.\n\nButcher-bird, in ornithology.

The upper part of the cerebrum is of an oval figure, like half an egg cut lengthwise. It is flatted on the lower part, each lateral half of which is divided into three eminences, called lobes, one anterior, one middle, and one posterior.\n\nThe substance of the cerebrum is of two kinds, distinguished by two different colours; one part of it, which is softest, being of a greyish or ash colour; the other, which is more solid, being very white. The ash-coloured substance lies chiefly on the outer part of the cerebrum like a kind of cortex, from whence it has been named substantia corticalis or cinerea. The white substance occupies the inner part, and is named substantia medullaris, or simply substantia alba.\n\nThe cerebrum is divided into two lateral portions, separated by the falx, or great longitudinal septum of the dura mater. They are generally termed hemispheres. Each of these portions is divided into two extremities, one anterior and one posterior, which are termed the lobes of the cerebrum, between which there is a large inferior protuberance which goes by the same name; so that in each hemisphere there are three lobes, one anterior, one middle, and one posterior.\n\nThe anterior lie upon these parts of the os frontis which contribute to the formation of the orbits and of the frontal sinuses, commonly called the anterior fossae of the basis cranii. The posterior lobes lie on the transverse septum; and the middle lobes, in the middle or lateral fossae of the basis cranii.\n\nEach lateral portion of the cerebrum has three sides; one superior, which is convex; one inferior, which is uneven; and one lateral, which is flat, and turned to the falx. Through the whole surface of these three sides we see inequalities or windings like the circumvolutions of interlines, formed by waving streaks or furrows very deep and narrow, into which the septa or duplicatures of the pia mater infuse themselves, and thereby separate these circumvolutions from each other.\n\nNear the surface these circumvolutions are at some distance from each other, representing serpentine ridges; and in the interstices between them, the superficial veins of the cerebrum are lodged, between the two laminae of the pia mater, from whence they pass in the duplicature of the dura mater, and so open into the sinuses.\n\nThese circumvolutions are fixed through their whole depth to the septa or duplicatures of the pia mater, by an infinite number of very fine vascular filaments.\n\nWhen they are cut tranversely, we observe that the substantia alba lies in the middle of each circumvolution, so that there is the same number of internal medullary circumvolutions as of external cortical ones.\n\nHaving cut off the falx from the crista galli, and turned it backward; if we separate gently the two lateral parts or hemispheres of the cerebrum, we see a longitudinal portion of a white convex body, which is named corpus callosum. It is a middle portion of the medullary substance, which under the inferior sinus of the falx, and also a little toward each side, is parted from the mass of the cerebrum, to which it is simply contiguous from one end of that sinus to the other.\n\nThe surface of the corpus callosum is covered by the pia mater, which runs in between the lateral portions of this body, and the lower edge of each hemisphere.\n\nThe corpus callosum becomes afterwards continuous on each side with the medullary substance, which through all the remaining parts of its extent is entirely united with the cortical substance, and together with the corpus callosum forms a medullary arch or vault of an oblong or oval figure. After which we will observe a medullary convexity much smaller than that which is common to the whole cerebrum, but of the same form; so that it appears like a medullary nucleus of the cerebrum.\n\nUnder this arch are two lateral cavities, much longer than they are broad, and very shallow, separated by a transparent medullary septum. These cavities are named the anterior, superior, or great lateral ventricles of the cerebrum.\n\nThe lateral ventricles are broad, and rounded at these extremities which lie next the transparent septum. They go from before backward, contracting in breadth, and separating from each other gradually in their progress. Afterwards they bend downward, and return obliquely from behind forward, in a course like the turning of a ram's horn, and terminate almost under their superior extremities. These ventricles are lined with a thin membrane.\n\nThe transparent partition or septum lucidum, lies directly under the raphe or future of the corpus callosum, of which it is a continuation. It is made up of two medullary laminae, more or less separated from each other by a narrow medullary cavity, sometimes filled with a scours substance.\n\nThe septum lucidum is united by its lower part, to the anterior portion of that medullary body, called the fornix with three pillars.\n\nThe fornix being cut off and inverted, or quite removed, we see first of all a vascular web, called plexus choroider, and several eminences more or less covered by the expansion of that plexus. There are four pairs of\neminences which follow each other very regularly, two large, and two small. The first two great eminences are named *corpora striata*; and the second, *thalami nervorum opticorum*. The four small eminences are closely united together; the anterior being called *nates*, and the posterior *tefes*. Immediately before these tubercles there is a single eminence, called *glandula pinealis*.\n\nThe *corpora striata* got that name, because in scraping them with the knife we meet with a great number of white and ash-coloured lines alternately disposed, which are only the transverse section of the medullary and cortical laminae, mixed together in a vertical position in the basis of the cerebrum.\n\nThey lie in the bottom of the superior cavity of the lateral ventricles, which they resemble in some measure in shape, their anterior parts being near the septum lucidum, from which they separate gradually as they run backward, and diminish in size.\n\nThe *thalami nervorum opticorum* are so named, because these nerves arise chiefly from them. They are two large eminences placed by the side of each other, between the posterior portions or extremities of the corpora striata. Their figure is semi-spheroidal and a little oval; and they are of a whitish colour on the surface; but their inner substance is partly greyish and partly white.\n\nThese two eminences are closely joined together, and at their convex part they are so far united as really to become one body, the whitish outer substance being continued uniformly over them both.\n\nImmediately within this whitish common substance these two eminences are closely contiguous till about the middle of their thickness; and from thence they separate insensibly toward the bottom, where by the space left between them a particular canal is formed, named the third ventricle, one extremity of which opens forward, the other backward.\n\nAt the bottom these two eminences are elongated downward toward both sides, into two thick, round, whitish cords, which separate from each other like horns, by a large curvature; and afterwards by a small curvature turned forward in an opposite direction to the former, and representing the tip of an horn, they approach each other again. The size of these ropes diminishes gradually from their origin to their anterior reunion.\n\nThe tubercles are four in number, two anterior, and two posterior; adhering together as if they made but one body, situated behind the union of the thalami nervorum opticorum. Their surface is white, and their inner substance greyish, and are called *nates* and *tefes*.\n\nDirectly under the place where the tubercles of one side are united to those of the other side, lies a small middle canal, which communicates by its anterior opening with the third ventricle, under the thalami nervorum opticorum, and by its posterior opening with the fourth ventricle, which belongs to the cerebellum.\n\nWhere the convex parts of the two anterior tubercles join these posterior convex parts of the thalami nervorum opticorum, an interface or opening is left between these four convexities which communicates with the third ventricle, and with the small middle canal. Instead of the ridiculous name of *anu*, which has been given to this opening, it may be called *foramen commune posterius*.\n\nThe glandula pinealis is a small soft greyish body, about the size of an ordinary pea, irregularly round, and sometimes of the figure of a pine apple, situated behind the thalami nervorum opticorum, above the tubercula quadrigemina. It is fixed like a small button to the lower part of the thalami by two very white medullary pedunculi, which at the gland are very near each other; but separate almost transversely toward the thalami.\n\nIt seems to be mostly of a cortical substance, except near the footstalks, where it is something medullary.\n\nBetween the basis of the anterior pillar of the fornix, and the anterior part of the union of the optic thalami, lies a cavity or fossula named *infundibulum*. It runs down towards the basis of the cerebrum, contracting gradually, and terminates in a straight course, by a small membranous canal, in a softish body situated in the sella turcica, named *glandula pituitaria*. The infundibulum opens above, immediately before the optic thalami, by an oval hole named *foramen commune anterius*, and consequently communicates with the lateral ventricles.\n\nAt the lower part of the thalami nervorum opticorum, directly under their union, lies a particular canal, called the third ventricle of the cerebrum.\n\nThis canal opens forward into the infundibulum under the foramen commune anterius, by which it likewise communicates with the lateral ventricles. It opens backward under the foramen commune posterius, between the thalami and tubercula quadrigemina, opposite to the small middle canal which goes to the cerebellum.\n\nThe plexus choroides is a very fine vascular texture, consisting of a great number of arteriak and venal ramifications, partly collected in two loose fasciculi, which lie one in each lateral ventricle, and partly expanded over the neighbouring parts, and covering in a particular manner the thalami nervorum opticorum, glandula pinealis, tubercula quadrigemina, and the other adjacent parts both of the cerebrum and cerebellum, to all which it adheres.\n\nThe pituitary gland is a small spongy body lodged in the sella turcica between the sphenoideal folds of the dura mater. It is of a singular kind of substance, which seems to be neither medullary nor glandular. On the outside it is partly greyish and partly reddish, and white within. It is transversely oval or oblong, and on the lower part in some subjects it is divided by a small notch into two lobes, like a kidney-bean. It is covered by the pia mater as by a bag, the opening of which is the extremity of the infundibulum, and it is surrounded by the small circular sinuses which communicate with the sinus cavernos.\n\n**Cerebellum.**\n\nThe cerebellum is contained under the transverse septum of the dura mater. It is broader laterally than on the fore or back sides, flatted on the upper side, and gently inclined both ways, answerable to the septum, which serves it as a kind of tent or ceiling. On the lower side it is rounder; and on the backside it is divided into...\ninto two lobes, separated by the occipital septum of the dura mater.\n\nIt is made up, like the cerebrum, of two substances, but it has no circumvolutions on its surface. Its sulci are pretty deep, and disposed in such a manner as to form thin flat strata, more or less horizontal, between which the internal lamina of the pia mater infinuates itself by a number of septa equal to that of the strata.\n\nUnder the transverse septum, it is covered by a vascular texture, which communicates with the plexus choroides. It has two middle eminences called appendices vermiformes; one anterior and superior, which is turned forward; the other posterior and inferior, which goes backward. There are likewise two lateral appendices, both turned outward.\n\nBesides the division of the cerebellum into lateral portions or into two lobes, each of these lobes seems to be likewise subdivided into three protuberances; one anterior, one middle or lateral, and one posterior.\n\nWhen we separate the two lateral portions or lobes, having first made a pretty deep incision, we discover first of all the posterior portion of the medulla oblongata; and in the posterior surface of this portion, from the tubercula quadrigemina, all the way to the posterior notch in the body of the cerebellum, and a little below that notch, we observe an oblong cavity which terminates backward like the point of a writing pen. This cavity is what is called the fourth ventricle.\n\nAt the beginning of this cavity, immediately behind the small common canal which lies under the tubercles, we meet with a thin medullary lamina, which is looked upon as a valve between that canal and the fourth ventricle. A little behind this lamina, the cavity grows wider towards both hands, and then contracts again to its first size. It is lined interiorly by a thin membrane, and seems oftentimes to be distinguished into two lateral parts, by a kind of small groove, from the valvular lamina to the point of the calamus scriptorius.\n\nThis membrane is a continuation of that which lines the small canal, the third ventricle, infundibulum, and the two great ventricles.\n\nOn each side of this ventricle the medullary substance forms a trunk which expands itself in form of laminae through the cortical strata. When one lobe of the cerebellum is cut vertically from above downward, the medullary substance will appear to be dispersed in ramifications through the cortical substance. These ramifications have been named arbor vitae; and the two trunks from whence these different laminae arise, are called pedunculi cerebrelli.","sp":337,"ep":339},{"h":"CHALCUM","t":"AURICLE, in anatomy, that part of the ear which is prominent from the head, called by many authors auris externa.

The insertion\nof these fibres is very broad, taking up about two thirds\nof the cartilage of the seventh rib, and a small part of\nthe bone, from whence it reaches beyond the angle of\nthe cartilage.\n\nThe second insertion is into the whole cartilage of the\nfirst false rib; the third partly in the bone, and partly\nin the cartilage of the second false rib; the fourth in\nthe bone, and sometimes a little in the cartilage of the\nthird false rib; the fifth in the bone, and a little in the\ncartilage of the fourth false rib, being broader than the\nrest.\n\nThe sixth is in the cartilage of the last false rib, and\nalmost through the whole length of the bone. At the\nhead of this rib, it joins the vertebral insertion, which\nruns from the lateral part of the last vertebra of the\nback, to the first vertebra of the loins.\n\nThe small muscle of the diaphragm is thicker than the\nother, but of much less extent. It is situated along\nthe foreside of the bodies of the last vertebra of the\nback and several of those of the loins, being turned a lit-\ntle to the left hand. It is of an oblong form, represent-\ning in some measure a fleshy collar, the two lateral por-\ntions of which cross each other, and afterward become\ntendinous toward the lower part.\n\nThe upper part of the body of this muscle is fixed in\nthe slope of the middle aponeurosis of the great muscle.\nThe outer edges of the alae or lateral portions join the\nposterior plane of the great muscle, and these portions\nadhere to the body of the last vertebra of the back.\nThe extremities, called likewise pillars or crura, are\ninserted by several tendinous digitations in the vertebrae\nof the loins.\n\nThe upper part of the fleshy body is formed by a par-\nticular intertexture of fibres belonging to the two alae.\nThese two alae, whereof that toward the right-hand is ge-\nnerally the most considerable, part from each other, and\nform an oval hole, terminated on the lower part by\nfibres, detached from the inside of each ala, immediately\nabove the last vertebra of the back. These fibres de-\ncussate and cross each other, and afterwards those that\ncome from each ala join that on the other side, so that\neach of the crura is a production of both alae.\nThe fibres that come from the left ala, cross over those from the right ala, and this again sends a small fasciculus of fibres over those of the left ala; afterwards the two crura part from each other.\n\nThe right crus is larger and longer than the left, and is always inserted in the four upper vertebrae of the loins, and often in the fifth likewise, by the same number of digitations, which become more and more tendinous as they descend, and at length are expanded in form of an aponeurosis. This crus lies more on the middle of the bodies of the vertebrae than on the right side.\n\nThe left crus is smaller and shorter, and lies more on the sides of the vertebrae. It is fixed by digitations to the three upper vertebrae of the loins, seldom reaching lower. The lower part of it is expanded in the same manner as the other; and the two expansions sometimes meet together.\n\nThe oval opening of this inferior muscle of the diaphragm, gives passage to the extremity of the oesophagus, and the aorta lies in the interstice between the two crura. Immediately above the opening or hole, a thin fasciculus of fibres is sent off to the stomach.\n\nIn the middle aponeurosis of the great muscles, a little to the right of the anterior part of the flopo, near the small muscle, is a round opening, which transmits the trunk of the lower vena cava. The border or circumference of this opening is very artfully formed by an oblique and succedaneo intertexture of tendinous fibres, almost like the edge of a wicker basket; and is, consequently, incapable either of dilatation or contraction, by the action of the diaphragm.\n\nWe find therefore three considerable openings in the diaphragm; one round and tendinous, for the passage of the vena cava; one oval and flebly, for the extremity of the oesophagus; and one forked, partly flebly, and partly tendinous, for the aorta. The round opening is to the right-hand, close to the upper part of the right ala of the small muscle; the oval opening is a little to the left; so that the right ala, which is between these two holes, lies almost directly over against the middle of the body of the eleventh vertebra of the back; the tendinous fork is under the oval opening, but a little more toward the middle.\n\n**SCALENI.**\n\nThese are compound muscles, irregularly triangular.\n\nThe scalenus primus is fixed to the upper part of the outside of the first rib, by two distinct portions, called commonly branches; one anterior, the other posterior. The anterior branch is fixed to the middle portion of the rib, about an inch from the cartilage. From thence it runs obliquely upward, and is inserted in the transverse apophysis of the sixth, fifth, and sometimes of the third vertebra of the neck.\n\nThe posterior branch is fixed more backward in the first rib, an interstice of about an inch being left between it and the other branch, through which the axillary artery and brachial nerves are transmitted. From thence it runs up obliquely behind the former, and is inserted in all the transverse apophyses of the neck.\n\nThe scalenus secundus is fixed a little more backward in the external labium of the upper edge of the second rib, sometimes by two separate portions, and sometimes without any division. The anterior portion is fixed immediately under the posterior portion of the first scalenus, by a short flat tendon, united a little with the first intercostal muscle. From thence it runs up over the posterior portion of the first scalenus, communicating likewise with that muscle, and is fixed by insertions, partly tendinous and partly flebly, in the transverse apophyses of the four first vertebrae of the neck.\n\nThe posterior portion is fixed in the second rib, more backward than the other. From thence it runs up, being divided into two portions, whereof one is inserted in the transverse apophyses of the three first vertebrae of the neck, behind the scalenus primus. The other portion runs up behind the former, and is inserted in the transverse apophyses of the two first vertebrae.\n\n**SERRATUS POSTICUS SUPERIOR.**\n\nThis is a flat thin muscle, situated on the upper part of the back. It is fixed on one side, by a broad aponeurosis, to the lower part of the posterior cervical ligament, and to the spinal apophyses of the two last vertebrae of the neck, and two first of the back.\n\nFrom thence it runs down a little obliquely forward, and is inserted, by broad flebly digitations, in the posterior part of the second, third, fourth, and sometimes of the fifth true ribs, near their angles; but sometimes it has no insertion in the second rib.\n\n**SERRATUS POSTICUS INFERIOR.**\n\nThis is a flat thin muscle, lying on the lower part of the back. It is fixed in the last spinal apophysis of the back, and in the three first of the loins, by a broad aponeurosis. From thence it runs up a little obliquely, and is fixed, by flebly broad digitations, in the last four false ribs. Its insertions, in the lowest rib, is near the cartilage, and, in the other three, near their angles.\n\n**INTERCOSTALES.**\n\nThe intercostal muscles are thin, flebly planes, lying in the interstices between the ribs, their fibres running obliquely from one rib to another. In each interstice lie two planes, an external and an internal, closely joined together, nothing but a thin, fine, cellular, membranous web coming between them.\n\nAccording to this natural division, there must be forty-four intercostal muscles in the twenty-two interstices left between the twenty-four ribs; and of these there are eleven external, and eleven internal, on each side. The fibres of the external intercostals run down from behind forward, and those of the internal intercostals from before backward; so that the fibres of these two series of muscles cross each other.\n\nThe external intercostals extend commonly from the vertebrae to the extremity of the upper labium of the bony portion of each rib, and go no further. The internal\nternal begin forward near the sternum, and end back-\nward at the angle of each rib.\n\n**SUPRA-COSTALES.**\n\nThese muscles are irregularly triangular, and situated\non the back-part of the ribs, near the vertebrae.\n\nEach of these muscles is fixed, by one tendinous ex-\ntremity, in the transverse apophysis, which lies above the\narticulation of each rib, and to the neighbouring liga-\nment; the first being inserted in the transverse apophysis\nof the last vertebra of the neck; and the last, in that of\nthe eleventh vertebra of the back.\n\nFrom thence the fleshy fibres run down obliquely, in-\ncreasing in breadth as they descend, and are inserted in\nthe back part of the outside of the following rib.\n\n**SUB-COSTALES.**\n\nThese are fleshy planes, of different breadths, and\nvery thin, situated more or less obliquely on the inside\nof the ribs, near the bony angles, and running in the\nsame direction with the external intercostals.\n\nThey are fixed by both extremities in the ribs; the\ninferior extremity being always at a greater distance from\nthe vertebra than the superior, and several ribs lying be-\ntween the two insertions.\n\n**STERNO-COSTALES vulgo Triangularis Sterni.**\n\nThese are five pairs of fleshy planes, disposed more\nor less obliquely on each side the sternum, and on the in-\nside of the cartilages of the second, third, fourth, fifth,\nand sixth true ribs.\n\nThey are inserted, by one extremity, in the edges of\nthe inside of all the lower half of the sternum. From\nthence the first muscle on each side runs up obliquely, and\nis fixed in the cartilage of the second rib. The second\nruns less obliquely to its insertion in the cartilage of the\nthird rib. The rest are inserted, in the same manner, in\nthe cartilages of the following ribs.\n\nThis last muscle is fixed, by one extremity, in the\ncartilage of the sixth true rib, near the bone, and seems\nto pass the appendix ensiformis, immediately above the\ninsertion of the diaphragm in that appendix, and to join\nthe muscle on the other side.\n\n**Uses of the Muscles employed in Respiration.**\n\nThe scaleni are sometimes ranked among those which\nserve for respiration; but they ought rather to be rank-\ned among the muscles which move the vertebrae of the\nneck; because the articulation of the first rib on both\nsides, with the first vertebra of the back, seems to serve\nonly for the motion of that vertebra on the rib, and not\nof the rib on the vertebra.\n\nThe serratus posterior superior is disposed to move up-\nwards the three or four upper ribs next the first.\n\nThe serratus posterior inferior is still better disposed for\ndepressing and keeping down the last three or four false\nribs.\n\nThe posterior fibres of the external intercostals are\nfixed, by their upper extremities, so near the articulation\nof the ribs with the vertebrae, that they cannot depress\nthat rib in which they are so inserted; whereas the\ninsertions of their lower extremities in the following\nrib being at a greater distance from the articulation,\nthey may move that rib upward. And from thence it\nfollows, that all the remaining part of each external in-\ntercostal which terminates at the bony extremity of each\nrib, can only serve to raise the lower rib toward the\nupper.\n\nThe anterior fibres of the internal intercostals are so\nnear the articulation of the ribs with the sternum, that\nthey cannot depress that cartilage in which each of them\nis inserted; whereas the inferior insertions of these fibres,\nbeing at a greater distance from the articulation, they are\nin a condition to raise the cartilages in which they are so\ninserted. From whence it follows, that all the internal\nintercostal muscles have the same use with the external,\nand that they can have no other.\n\nThe supra-costales are powerful assistants to the inter-\ncostals in their common action, and are therefore very\njustly termed levatores costarum.\n\nThe sterno-costales depress the cartilaginous portions,\nand anterior extremities of the ribs, especially the supe-\nrior ribs, except the first; and at the same time draw\nthe cartilages of the inferior ribs near the sternum, by\nreason of the curvature. They may therefore very well\nbe called depressores costarum, as the supra-costales are\nnamed levatores.\n\nThe sub-costales having the superior extremities of\ntheir fibres much more distant from the vertebral articu-\nlation of the ribs than the lower extremities, it follows,\nthat they can more easily move the upper than the lower\nribs, and consequently that they are assistants to the\nsterno-costales.\n\nThe diaphragm, together with the intercostal muscles,\nthe ribs, sternum, and vertebrae of the back, forms the\ncavity of the thorax, and it divides this cavity from that\nof the abdomen.\n\nIts particular use is to be the principal organ of respi-\nration, that is, of the alternate expansion and contraction\nof the thorax. The other muscles already mentioned\nare to be considered only as assistants and directors, in\norder to facilitate and regulate these motions, which, in\nthe ordinary state, are perpetual, but which may, by the\naction of these other muscles, be accelerated, retarded,\nor even be suspended for some space of time.\n\nThe diaphragm may move when the ribs are at rest,\nand consequently without the assistance of the muscles\nwhich move the ribs; and this motion may be sufficient\nto keep up the alternate dilatation and contraction of the\nthorax.\n\n**Sect. XIV. The Muscles which move the Head on the Trunk.**\n\n**STERNO-MASTOID\u00c6US vulgo Mastoid\u00e6us Anterior.**\n\nThis is a long, narrow, pretty thick, and mostly\nfleshy muscle, situated obliquely between the back part\nof the ear, and lower part of the throat. It is in a manner composed of two muscles, united at the upper part through their whole breadth, and separated at the lower.\n\nIt has two insertions below, both of them flat, and a little tendinous. The first is in the upper edge of the sternum, near the articulation of the clavicle; the other in the clavicle, at a small distance from the sternum.\n\nThe sternal portion passes foremost, and covers the clavicular, both forming one body or belly, which running in the same oblique direction to the apophysis mastoid\u00e6us, is inserted in the upper and back-part of that process; over which it likewise extends off a very broad aponeurosis, which covers the splenius, and is inserted in the os occipitis.\n\n**SPLENIUS five MASTOID\u00c6US POSTERIOR.**\n\nThis is a flat, broad, oblong muscle, situated obliquely, between the back-part of the ear, and the posterior and lower part of the neck. It is partly single, and partly made up of two portions, one superior, the other inferior.\n\nThe superior portion is fixed to the extremities of the three or four lowest spinal apophyses of the neck, and of the first, or first and second, of the back.\n\nIt is likewise fixed to the edge of the inter-spinal ligaments of the other vertebrae.\n\nFrom thence it runs up obliquely toward the mastoid apophysis, partly under the upper extremity of the sternomastoid\u00e6us, and is inserted in the upper part of that process, and along the neighbouring curve portion of the transverse ridge of the os occipitis.\n\nThe inferior portion of the splenius is fixed to three or four spinal apophyses of the back, beginning by the second or third. From thence it runs up, being closely united to the other portion, till it reaches the superior and lateral part of the neck, where it separates from it, and is inserted in the transverse apophyses of the three or four superior vertebrae of the neck, by the same number of extremities, a little tendinous, which, however, are sometimes only two in number.\n\n**COMPLEXUS.**\n\nThis is a pretty long and broad muscle, lying on the posterior lateral part of the neck, all the way to the occiput. It is complicated, by reason of the decollations of its different portions; from which it has its name.\n\nIt is fixed below, by small short tendons, to the transverse apophyses of all the vertebrae of the neck, except the first, to which it is fixed only near the root of its transverse apophysis. From thence it runs up obliquely backward, crossing under the splenius, and often communicating with it, by some fasciculi of fibres.\n\nIt is afterwards inserted above, by a broad fleshy plane, in the posterior part of the superior transverse line of the os occipitis, near the crista or spine of that bone.\n\n**Complexus Minor five Mastoid\u00e6us Lateralis.**\n\nThis is a long, slender, narrow indented muscle, lying along all the side of the neck, up to the ear, where it increases a little in breadth.\n\nIt is fixed, by one extremity, in all the transverse apophyses of the neck, except the first, by the same number of digitations or branches, mostly fleshy, and disposed obliquely.\n\nFrom thence it ascends, and having reached above the transverse apophysis of the first vertebra, it forms a small broad plane, by which it is inserted in the posterior part of the apophysis mastoid\u00e6us.\n\n**RECTUS MAJOR.**\n\nThis is a small, flat, short muscle, broad at the upper part, and narrow at the lower, situated obliquely between the occiput and second vertebra of the neck.\n\nIt is fixed below to one branch of the bifurcated spine of the second vertebra of the neck, at a tuberosity which is often found at the upper part of that branch. From thence it ascends a little obliquely outward, and is inserted in the posterior part of the inferior transverse line of the os occipitis, at a small distance from the crista, being a little covered by the obliquus superior.\n\n**RECTUS MINOR.**\n\nThis muscle is like the former, and it has also a small insertion below, in the posterior eminence of the first vertebra. From thence it ascends laterally, and is inserted immediately under the posterior part of the inferior transverse line of the os occipitis, in a superficial fossula on one side of the crista occipitalis.\n\n**OBLIQUUS SUPERIOR five MINOR.**\n\nThis muscle is situated laterally between the occiput and first vertebra, being nearly of the same figure with the two recti. It is fixed to the end of the transverse apophysis of the first vertebra; from whence it runs upward and very obliquely backward, and is inserted in the transverse line of the os occipitis, almost at an equal distance from the crista and mastoid apophysis, between the rectus major and complectus minor.\n\n**OBLIQUUS INFERIOR five MAJOR.**\n\nIt is situated in a contrary direction to the obliquus superior, between the first and second vertebra of the neck, resembling that muscle in every thing but the size. It is fixed below to one ramus of the bifurcated spinal apophysis of the second vertebra, near the insertion of the rectus major; from whence it runs obliquely upwards and outward, and is inserted in the end of the transverse apophysis of the first vertebra, under the lower insertion of the obliquus superior.\n\n**RECTUS ANTICUS LONGUS.**\n\nThis muscle is, in some measure, of a pyramidal figure, lying along the anterior and lateral parts of the vertebra of the neck, all the way up the basis cranii.\nIt is fixed to the anterior parts of the transverse apophysis of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth vertebrae in a digitated manner. From thence it runs obliquely inward toward the lateral parts of the bodies of the vertebrae, passes on the fore-side of the first and second, without being inserted in them; and, approaching gradually towards the same muscle on the other side, it is inserted near it in the fore-part of the lower side of the apophysis basilaris, or great apophysis of the os occipitis.","sp":255,"ep":261},{"h":"DIDYNAMIA ANGIOSPERMIA","t":"Digitalis, or Fox-glove.\n\nThe Calyx is a perianthium, divided into four deep cut segments, which are roundish, sharp at the top, persistent, and the highest one is narrower than the rest.\n\nThe Corolla consists of one bell-shaped petal; the tubus is large, open, ventricose or bellied at the backside; the base is cylindrical and narrow; the limbus is small, and divided into four segments; the superior segment is more open and more emarginated than the rest.\n\nThe Stamina are four, subulated (44), inserted into the base of the corolla, and inclined to the same side; two of them are longer than the other two; the anther\u00e6 are divided into two parts, and pointed at the top.\n\nThe Pistillum consists of a germen sharp at the top, a simple stylus situate like the stamina, and an acute stigma.\n\nThe Pericarpium has an oval capsule, of the same length with the calyx, sharp at the top, having two cells, and two valves which burst open at both sides.\n\nThe Seeds are many and small.","sp":760,"ep":760},{"h":"END OF THE FIRST VOLUME","t":"ERRATA.\n\nPage 127, column 2, end of the first paragraph, read Plate XI. fig. 3; and at the end of the next paragraph, Plate XII. fig. 2.\n\nEnd of the article AMPHIBOENA, read Plate XII. fig. 2.\n\nSt Andrew's day.

G, Its beginning from the testicle. H, The body of the testicle, inclosed in the tunica albuginea.\n\nThis general mass is divided into three particular portions; the cerebrum or brain properly so called, the cerebellum, and medulla oblongata. To these three parts, a fourth is added, which fills the great canal of the spina dorsi, by the name of medulla spinalis, being a continuation of the medulla oblongata.\n\nThe\nThe meninges or membranes are two in number. The first is named dura mater; the second pia mater, which is again divided into two; the external lamina being termed arachnoides, the internal retaining the common name of pia mater.\n\n**DURA MATER.**\n\nThe dura mater incloses the brain and all its appendages. It lines the inside of the cranium, and supplies the place of an internal periosteum, being spread in all the holes and depressions, and covering all the eminences in such a manner as to prevent their being hurtful to the brain.\n\nThe dura mater is made up of two laminae, adhering very closely together; the fibres of both crossing each other obliquely. Their texture is very close and strong, appearing to be partly ligamentary and partly tendinous.\n\nThe dura mater sticks closely to the cranium by a great number of filaments of the external lamina, which enter the pores of the bones chiefly at the sutures both above and below; and by penetrating these joints, they communicate with the external periosteum.\n\nThese adhesions are formed entirely by the external lamina. The internal lamina is very smooth and polished on the inside, which is also continually moistened by a fine fluid discharged through its pores, much in the same manner as in the peritoneum and pleura.\n\nThe folds of the dura mater are made by the internal lamina; and three of them form particular septa; one of which is superior, representing a kind of mediafimnum between the two great lobes of the brain. The second is in a middle situation, like a diaphragm between the cerebrum and cerebellum; the third is inferior, between the lobes of the cerebellum. The superior septum is longitudinal, in form of a scythe, from whence it is termed the falx of the dura mater. The middle septum is transverse, and might be called the diaphragm of the brain. The inferior septum is very small, and runs down between the lobes of the cerebellum.\n\nBesides these large folds, there are two small lateral ones on each side of the sella turcica, each running from the posterior to the anterior clyoid apophysis on the same side. These two folds, together with the anterior and posterior parts of the sella turcica, form a small fossula in which the pituitary gland is lodged.\n\nThe elongations of the dura mater are productions of both laminae, which go beyond the general circumference, and pass out of the cranium.\n\nThe most considerable of these elongations passes through the great occipital foramen, and runs down the common canal of the vertebrae in form of a tube, lining the inside of that canal, and inclosing the medulla spinalis; by the name of the dura mater of that medulla. The other elongations accompany the nerves out of the cranium in form of vagines, which are more numerous than the nervous trunks reckoned in pairs.\n\nThere are two particular elongations which form the periosteum of the orbits, together with the vagines of the optic nerves. These orbital elongations go out by the sphenoidal or superior orbital fissures, and, increasing in breadth in their passage, line the whole cavity of the orbits, at the edges of which they communicate with the pericranium and periosteum of the face.\n\nThe elongations of the dura mater which accompany the blood-vessels through the foramina of the cranium, unite with the pericranium immediately afterwards. Such, for instance, are the elongations which line the fossula of the foramina lacera or jugularia, and the bony or carotid canals of the apophysis petrofa, &c.\n\nThe dura mater contains in its duplicature several particular canals, into which the venal blood not only of that membrane, but of the whole brain, is carried. These canals are termed sinuses, and some of them are disposed in pairs, others in uneven numbers; that is, some of them are placed alone, in a middle situation; others are disposed laterally on each side of the brain. The most ancient anatomists reckoned only four; to which we can now add four times as many.\n\nThese sinuses are in the duplicature of the dura mater; and their cavities are lined on the inside by particular very fine membranes. They may be enumerated in this manner.\n\nThe great sinus of the falx, or superior longitudinal sinus, which was reckoned the first by the ancients.\n\nTwo great lateral sinuses, the second and third of the ancients.\n\nThe sinus called torcular Herophili, the fourth of the ancients.\n\nThe small sinus of the falx, or inferior longitudinal sinus.\n\nThe posterior occipital sinus, which is sometimes double.\n\nTwo inferior occipital sinuses, which form a portion of a circle, and may likewise be called the inferior lateral sinuses.\n\nSix sinuses petrosi, three on each side, one anterior, one middle or angular, and one inferior. The two inferior, together with the occipital sinuses, complete a circular sinus round the great foramen of the os occipitis.\n\nThe inferior transverse sinus.\n\nThe superior transverse sinus.\n\nThe two circular sinuses of the sella sphenoidalis; one superior, and one inferior.\n\nTwo sinus cavernosi, one on each side.\n\nTwo orbitary sinuses, one on each side.\n\nAll these sinuses communicate with each other, and with the great lateral sinuses by which they discharge themselves into the internal jugular veins, which are only continuations of these lateral sinuses. They likewise unload themselves partly into the vertebral veins, which communicate with the small lateral or inferior occipital sinuses; and partly into the external jugular veins, by the orbitary sinuses which communicate with the vena angulares, frontales, nasales, maxillares, &c. as the lateral sinuses likewise communicate with the vena occipitales, &c.\n\nThus the blood which is carried to the dura mater, &c. by the external and internal carotid, and by the vertebral arteries, is returned to the heart by the external and internal jugular and vertebral veins; so that when the passage of the blood is obstructed in any particular place, it finds another way, by virtue of these communications, though not with the same ease.","sp":333,"ep":334},{"h":"EXPLANATION OF PLATE XXI","t":"Figure 1.

The other end terminates by a short flatish tendon, fixed to that side of the basis of the first phalanx of the little finger which is turned from the thumb.\n\nUses of the Muscles which move the Fingers.\n\nThe perforatus serves to bend the second phalanges of all the fingers except the thumb; and the particular muscles, of which it is made up, may act separately, by reason of their distinct insertions in these phalanges.\n\nThey not only bend the second phalanges on the first, but also the first on the metacarpal bones, and the metacarpus and carpus on the fore-arm.\n\nThe perforans bends particularly the third phalanges in which it is inserted; and by the same motion it may likewise bend the first and second phalanges.\n\nIt may likewise be esteemed an assistant to the ulnaris and radialis interni in great efforts; and these muscles many reciprocally be looked upon as assistants to the perforatus and perforans.\n\nThe extensor digitorum communis serves to extend the four fingers, to keep them in any degree of extension, and to moderate their flexion in all the determinate degrees of action of the perforatus and perforans.\n\nEach tendon serves to extend a whole finger, that is,\nall the three phalanges together; and likewise each phalanx by itself, though not with the same facility.\n\nThe proper extensors of the fore and little fingers are assistants to two subaltern muscles of the extensor communis that go to these fingers, which consequently we extend separately with more ease than either of the other two. These muscles likewise serve to bring the fingers, in which they are inserted, near the other fingers.\n\nThe flexor pollicis longus serves chiefly to bend the third phalanx of the thumb, in which it is inserted by the extremity of its tendon. It likewise bends the second phalanx, by virtue of the ligamentary vagina, through which it passes, as through an annular ligament.\n\nThe first extensor of the thumb alone, when there are three, a portion of the first, when there are but two, serves to draw the first phalanx from the palm of the hand, or to keep it at a distance therefrom.\n\nThe second of these muscles when there are three, or the second portion of the first when there are but two, serves to extend the second phalanx on the first.\n\nThe third when there are three, or the second when there are but two, extends the third phalanx on the second.\n\nWhen they act all together, they assist each other by the graduated insertions of their small subaltern tendons.\n\nThe thenar, by its insertion in the first phalanx of the thumb, serves to draw it from the first bone of the metacarpus, more or less directly, as one of its portions acts more than the other, or as they both act equally.\n\nBy the insertion of the large portion in the basis of the second phalanx, by the intervention of the sesamoid bone of the same side, it may bend this phalanx laterally on the first, and thereby bring the thumb to a greater distance from the index.\n\nThe metothenar moves the first phalanx of the thumb towards the hollow of the hand, more or less obliquely, as it acts either alone or with the large portion of the thenar, or even with the antithenar. By its insertion in the sesamoid bone of the second phalanx, it likewise moves that phalanx on the first, and thereby assists the flexor longus.\n\nThe antithenar moves the first phalanx of the thumb toward the first bone of the metacarpus, and thereby presses the thumb laterally against the index. This motion becomes more or less oblique by the co-operation of the metothenar.\n\nThe hypothenar minor serves to separate the little finger from the rest; which motion is commonly called abduction. It likewise keeps this finger separated in all situations, that is, in all degrees of flexion or extension.\n\nThe interossei may have two different uses, according to their different insertion, and the different situations of the fingers in which they are inserted.\n\nIn general, they assist the extensor communis by their insertions in the lateral angles of the rhomboidal fissures; for thereby they act like lateral ropes, which, together with the tendons of the extensor, serve to extend the third phalanx of each finger.\n\nBy the same lateral insertions they perform the lateral motions of the fingers, that is, they press them all close against each other, but do not separate them all, nor move each finger in particular toward, or from, the thumb. In a general separation of all the fingers, the interossei move only the middle and ring fingers; the index and little finger being separated by other muscles. In the motions of the fingers toward the thumb, which is termed adduction, they act only on three fingers, the middle, ring, and little fingers. In the contrary motion, or abdution of the fingers, they move likewise three, viz. the index, middle, and ring fingers.\n\nThe use of the interossei in particular, whether external or internal, may be different in different subjects, according to the variety of their insertions; and therefore in living bodies nothing can be determined about them.\n\nAccording to the situation in which they have been described, the first and second external interossei perform alternately the adduction and abdution of the middle finger; the third performs the abdution of the ring-finger; that is, moves it toward the little finger.\n\nThe first internal interosseus makes the abdution of the index, or moves it toward the middle finger; the second makes the adduction of the ring-finger, by moving it likewise toward the middle finger; and the third performs the adduction of the little finger, or moves it toward the middle finger.\n\nThe use of the semi-interosseus indicis is to move the first phalanx of the index, more or less directly, toward the great edge of the metacarpus, by removing it from the middle finger. This motion is not a true adduction of the index toward the thumb.\n\nThe lumbricales, by the union of their tendons with those of the interossei, are coadjutors to these muscles, not only in the lateral motions of the four fingers, but also in bending and extending them. In the lateral motions, they co-operate according to their situation in each subject; and it is possible that the variety of their insertions answers to that of the interossei, so that the reciprocal co-operation continues still to be equal.\n\nSect. IX. The Muscles which move the Os Femoris upon the Pelvis.\n\nPSOAS five LUMBARIS INTERNUS.\n\nThis is a long thick muscle situated in the abdomen on the lumbar region, adhering to the vertebrae of the loins, from the posterior part of the os ilium to the anterior part near the thigh.\n\nIt is fixed above to the last vertebra of the back, and to all those of the loins, that is, to the lateral parts of the bodies of these vertebrae, and to the roots of their transverse apophyses. The insertions in the bodies of the vertebrae are by a kind of digitations, and are very little tendinous.\n\nFrom thence the muscle runs down laterally over the os ilium, on one side of the iliac muscle, and passes under the ligamentum Fallopii, between the anterior inferior spine of the os ilium, and that eminence which from its situation may be termed ilio-pelvina.\nBefore it goes out of the abdomen, it unites with the iliacus, and is sometimes fixed, by a few fleshy fibres, in the outside of the eminence last mentioned. It afterwards covers the fore-side of the head of the os femoris, and is inserted in the fore-part of the little trochanter by an oblique tendon, which is folded double from behind forward.\n\n**ILIACUS.**\n\nThis is a broad thick muscle, lying on the whole inside of the os ilium.\n\nIt is fixed by fleshy fibres to the internal labium of the crista osis ilium, to that of the slope between the two anterior spines, to the insides of these spines, to the superior half of the inside of this bone, and to the neighbouring lateral part of the os sacrum.\n\nAll these fibres, contracting by degrees, run obliquely towards the lower part of the musculus psoas, uniting therewith, and being fixed by a kind of aponeurosis to the outside of its tendon all the way to the little trochanter. They cover the head of the os femoris, and some of the lowest are inserted in that bone a little above and behind the little trochanter, and others a little lower down.\n\nThe iliacus and psoas, thus united, pass under the ligamentum Fallopia, over the slope or channel, between the anterior inferior spine of the os ilium and eminentia ilio-pectinea, in a sort of ligamentary capsule very smooth and polished.\n\n**PECTINEUS.**\n\nThis is a small, flat, and pretty long muscle, broad at the upper part, and narrow at the lower, situated obliquely between the os pubis and upper part of the os femoris.\n\nIt is fixed above by fleshy fibres to all the sharp ridge or crista of the os pubis, and to a small part of the oblong notch or depression on the foreside of that crista, in which the upper extremity of this muscle is lodged.\n\nFrom thence it runs down obliquely towards the little trochanter, under and a little behind which, it is inserted obliquely by a flat tendon, between the superior insertion of the vastus internus, and inferior insertion of the triceps secundus, with which it is united.\n\n**GLUT\u00c6US MAXIMUS.**\n\nThis is a thick broad muscle, lying on the outside of the os ilium and upper part of the os femoris.\n\nIt is fixed wholly fleshy to all the lateral posterior parts of the os coccygis and os sacrum; to the ligamentum sacro-fasciaticum; to the outside of the tuberosity of the os ilium; and from thence to the external labium of the crista of that bone all the way to its highest part, where this muscle mixes fibres with the glut\u00e6us medius.\n\nIt is likewise fixed to the inside of the fascia lata, at the places which answer to all the insertions already mentioned, but through a much greater space, and by a very great number of fleshy fibres, almost in the same manner as we shall see in the external plane of the musculus temporalis. The fibres which end in this fascia become gradually shorter, as they are situated lower.\n\nAll these fibres contract in breadth in a radiated manner as they approach to the great trochanter, and afterwards form a strong, flat, pretty broad tendon, about an inch in length, which is inserted a finger's breadth or a little more below the great trochanter, in all that large longitudinal impression at the upper part of the linea alpina on the back-side of the os femoris, between the vastus externus and largest portion of the triceps.\n\n**GLUT\u00c6US MEDIUS.**\n\nThis is a radiated muscle, almost in the shape of a spread fan. It is pretty thick, and almost as broad as the whole outside of the os ilium, being situated between the crista of that bone and the great trochanter, and covered anteriorly by the fascia lata, and posteriorly by the glut\u00e6us maximus.\n\nIt is fixed above by fleshy fibres to all that space on the outside of the os ilium, which lies between the external labium of the crista, and the semicircular impression which goes between the superior anterior spine, and the great posterior sinus.\n\nIt is likewise fixed in the edge of that ligament which goes between the lower part of the os sacrum and os ilium. Lastly, the inner part of it, which is covered only by the fascia lata, is inserted in the inside of that fascia in the same manner as the glut\u00e6us maximus.\n\nFrom thence all the fibres contract in breadth, more or less, in a radiated manner, as they advance toward the great trochanter, and form a short thick tendon, which mixes a little anteriorly with the tendon of the glut\u00e6us minimus; and the most posterior fibres gradually join the side of the tendon of the pyriformis.\n\nThe tendon is inserted in the upper convex part of the great trochanter, from the apex of the large superior external rough surface, all the way to the anterior rough surface, encompassing in a manner all that part of the trochanter.\n\n**GLUT\u00c6US MINIMUS.**\n\nThis is a small, broad, radiated muscle, situated on the outside of the os ilium, under the other two glut\u00e6i.\n\nIt is fixed above in all that portion of the outside of the os ilium, which lies between the great semicircular line, and another small one, a little above the supracilium of the cotyloid cavity or acetabulum, running between the anterior inferior spine and the great posterior sinus. It is likewise fixed in the edge of that sinus, in the spine of the ischium, and in the orbicular ligament of the joint of the hip.\n\nFrom thence its fibres, contracting in breadth, form a short tendon, by which the muscle is inserted in the anterior part of the upper edge of the great trochanter, above the great external convex rough surface in which the glut\u00e6us medius is fixed.\n\n**TRICEPS**","sp":244,"ep":246},{"h":"ICOSANDRIA POLYGAMIA","t":"Fragaria, or Strawberry.\n\nThe Calyx is a perianthium, consisting of one plain leaf, divided into ten segments, each alternately narrower.\n\nThe Corolla has five roundish open petals inserted into the calyx.\n\nThe Stamina are twenty in number, subulated or tapering, shorter than the corolla, and inserted into the calyx; the anther\u00e6 are lunulated, or shaped like a crescent.\n\nThe Pistillum consists of many small germina, collected into a little head or knob.

The arm being lifted directly upward, the lateral, anterior, and posterior portions of this muscle may bring the arm, so raised, forward and backward.\n\nThe latissimus dorsi serves in general to bring down the arm when raised; it also serves to depress the shoulder, or to maintain it in that situation against any force that endeavours to raise it; as when we lean upon the elbow in sitting, or walk upon crutches.\n\nThe pectoralis major serves in general to bring the arm near the ribs, to press it strongly against them, and to carry it towards the fore-part of the thorax.\n\nThe teres major, by being inserted in the os humeri in a direction parallel to the latissimus dorsi, becomes a congener to the superior and posterior portion of that muscle; and accordingly moves the os humeri in the same manner with it. It turns the bone round its axis, when the fore-arm is carried behind the back.\n\nIt likewise pulls the arm directly backward, without moving it round its axis.\n\nThe coraco-brachialis brings the arm to the foreside of the thorax, raising it at the same time; and, in this case, it may be reckoned a congener or assistant to the pectoralis major in great efforts; and may perform the same motion by itself, when no great force is necessary; as when the whole arm hangs down, and is moved backward and forward like a pendulum, the motion forward being performed by the coraco-brachialis, and the motion backward by the teres major, its antagonist.\n\nThis muscle may likewise move the scapula on the os humeri kept firmly depressed, as when sitting in a chair we take fast hold of the edge of it with the hand. In this case the coraco-brachialis may bring the acromion downward, and the inferior angle of the scapula, near the vertebrae. It serves likewise to bring the arm to its former situation, after it has been turned by the latissimus dorsi, in order to apply the hand to the back; and then it turns the os humeri upon its axis in a contrary direction to that given it by the other muscle.\n\nThe supra-spinatus joins with the deltoides in lifting up the arm; this muscle beginning that action, and the deltoides continuing it.\n\nThe infra-spinatus being inserted by its tendon in the middle surface of the great tuberosity of the os humeri, must perform different motions according to the different situations of that bone. If it acts while the arm hangs down, parallel to the trunk of the body, it may move the os humeri round its axis, from before outward; and consequently, if the fore-arm be at the same time bent, it will turn the hand from the body, &c.\n\nWhen the arm hangs down in its natural situation, the subscapularis may turn it round its axis, from without forward, as it happens when in this situation we beat the breast with the fore-arm bent; and it likewise strongly assists the latissimus dorsi, when we turn the hand behind the back.\n\nWhen the arm being raised, we move it backward, as in giving a back-stroke with the elbow or fist, the subscapularis hinders the head of the os humeri from being luxated forward.\nThe teres minor may turn the arm when depressed round its axis, from before outward; as it happens when the fore-arm, being bent and applied to the lower part of the breast, is removed from thence, without moving the elbow from the side.\n\n**Sect. V. The Muscles which move the Bones of the Fore-arm on the Os Humeri.**\n\n**BICEPS or CORACO-RADIALIS.**\n\nThis is a double muscle made up of two long fleshy bodies, more or less round, lying by the side of each other, on the middle anterior part, and a little toward the inside of the arm. These two bodies are separated above, each of them ending in a small tendon. As they run down they become contiguous, and afterwards closely united by one common broad tendon.\n\nIt is fixed by one of the superior tendons, in the apex of the coracoid apophysis of the scapula.\n\nThe other superior tendon is smaller and longer than the former, and the fleshy body belonging to it shorter and more compounded. This tendon is lodged in the bony channel of the os humeri, being surrounded by a membranous vagina continued from the capsular ligament, and ending at the fleshy body where it is entirely closed.\n\n**BRACHIIUS.**\n\nThis is an oblong, thick, and broad muscle, lying immediately on the anterior part of the lower half of the os humeri. The upper part of it is forked or sloped, and at the bending of the joint of the elbow the lower part contracts.\n\nIt is fixed to the surface of the os humeri by a great number of fleshy fibres, from the lower insertion of the deltoides, almost down to the two fossae at the lower extremity of the bone, and from one edge of the foreside of this lower extremity to the other. The fibres are for the most part longitudinal, those nearest the surface of the muscle being longest, the more internal growing gradually shorter.\n\n**ANCON\u00c6US MAJOR.**\n\nThis is a long fleshy muscle lying on the backside of the os humeri.\n\nIt is fixed above by a short tendon to the inferior impression in the neck of the scapula, and to a small part of the inferior colca of that bone. From thence it passes between the extremities of the subscapularis and teres minor, and, having reached the backside of the lower extremity of the os humeri, it ends obliquely in a strong broad tendon, which, adhering closely in the capsular ligament, is afterwards fixed by a broad insertion in the rough tuberosity on the upper side of the olecranon.\n\n**ANCON\u00c6US EXTERNUS.**\n\nThis is a long muscle lying on the outer part of the backside of the os humeri, from its neck to the external condyle.\n\nIt is fixed above in the neck of the os humeri under the inferior surface of the great tuberosity, and under the insertion of the teres minor, but a little more backward. It is likewise fixed by some oblique fibres in the external inter-muscular ligament.\n\n**ANCON\u00c6US INTERNUS.**\n\nThis muscle is shorter and more fleshy than the ancon\u00e6us externus, and lies toward the inner part of the lower half of the os humeri.\n\nIt is fixed above, under the lower extremity of the teres major, but a little more backward, and to the internal inter-muscular ligament, which makes a kind of septum between this muscle and the brachium. From thence the fibres contracting in breadth, pass toward the tendon of the ancon\u00e6us major, some of them running in between it and the bone, and are inserted in the edge and inner side of that tendon.\n\n**ANCON\u00c6US MINOR.**\n\nThis is a small muscle obliquely triangular, lying in the oblong fossula on the outside of the olecranon.\n\nIt is fixed by a small, but pretty strong tendon, in the lower part of the external condyle of the os humeri. From thence the fleshy fibres run down obliquely in a radiated form, and are inserted in the bottom and whole posterior edge of the fossula already mentioned.\n\n**Uses of the Muscles which move the Bones of the Fore-arm on the Os Humeri.**\n\nThe biceps, or coraco-radialis, bends both bones of the fore-arm, and turns the radius upon the ulna; performing both motions by its insertion in the radius alone. It likewise moves the os humeri on the fore-arm, the scapula on the os humeri, and the os humeri on the scapula.\n\nThe brachius serves to bend the fore-arm on the os humeri, by its insertion in the ulna, and by the connection of that bone with the radius. It serves also to move the os humeri on the fore-arm.\n\nThe ancon\u00e6us maximus serves to extend the fore-arm, by bringing the ulna to a straight line with the os humeri. It serves likewise to extend the os humeri on the ulna, when the last named bone is fixed by some exterior resistance, as when, being laid upon the ground, we rise by supporting ourselves on our hand. In this case likewise, the scapula must be kept steady by the coraco-brachialis.\n\nThe two lateral ancon\u00e6i co-operate with, and assist the ancon\u00e6us maximus, in extending the fore-arm on the os humeri, and the os humeri on the fore-arm.\n\nThe ancon\u00e6us minimus may concur with the other muscles of that name, in extending the fore-arm on the os humeri, and the os humeri on the fore-arm; but its action does not reach to all the degrees of flexion of these bones; for when the fore-arm is very much bent, if we examine...\nexamine carefully the situation of this muscle, we will find it more disposed to maintain these bones in that posture, by co-operating with the brachialis, than to extend them by afflicting the other ancon\u00e6i.\n\n**Sect. VI. The Muscles which move the Radius upon the Ulna.**\n\n**Supinator Longus sive Major.**\n\nThis is a long flat muscle, lying on the external condyle of the os humeri, and on the convex side of the radius from one end to the other.\n\nIt is fixed by fleshy fibres to the external inter-muscular ligament, and to the crista of the external condyle of the os humeri, for five or six fingers breadth above the condyle, between the brachius and ancon\u00e6us externus. From thence it runs along the whole convex side of the radius, and is inserted by a flat narrow tendon, a little above the styloid apophysis in the angle between the concave and flat sides of the extremity of this bone.\n\n**Supinator Brevis sive Minor.**\n\nThis is a small thin fleshy muscle, surrounding a great portion of the upper third part of the radius.\n\nIt is fixed by one end to the lower part of the external condyle of the os humeri, to the external lateral ligament of the joint, to the annular ligament of the radius, and to part of the lateral eminence in the head of the ulna.\n\nFrom thence it passes obliquely over the head of the radius, covering some part of it; and running down upon, and in some measure surrounding the neck, it turns in under the bicipital tuberosity, and is inserted by the side of the interosseous ligament in the inside of the superior quarter of the bone, and even a little lower.\n\n**Pronator Teres sive Obliquus.**\n\nThis is a small muscle, broader than it is thick, situated on the upper part of the ulna opposite to the supinator brevis.\n\nIt is fixed to the internal condyle of the os humeri, partly by fleshy fibres, and partly by a tendon common to it with the ulnaris internus. From thence it passes obliquely before the extremity of the tendon of the brachius, and reaches to the middle part of the convex side of the radius, where it becomes flat, and is inserted below the supinator brevis by an extremity almost wholly fleshy.\n\n**Pronator Quadratus sive Transversus.**\n\nThis is a small fleshy muscle nearly as broad as it is long, lying transversely on the inside of the lower extremity of the fore-arm.\n\nIt is fixed by one side or edge in the long eminence at the lower part of the internal angle of the ulna, and by the other in the broad concave side of the lower extremity of the radius.\n\nIt has a ligamentary or tendinous fr\u00e6num belonging to it, one end of which is fixed in the interosseous ligament, the other in the inner edge of the basis of the radius.\n\n**The Uses of the Muscles which move the Radius on the Ulna.**\n\nThe supinator longus assists in the motion of supination, and is also a flexor of the fore-arm.\n\nThe supinator brevis seems to have no other use than what is expressed by its name; and as it is a short small muscle, it must be very weak.\n\nThe pronator teres can have no other action but that of pronation, in the different situations of the radius, whether that bone be in a middle state between pronation and supination, or in the greatest degree of supination; and, in this case, though it is but a small weak muscle, it overcomes the supinator longus.\n\nThe pronator quadratus is capable of no other motion but pronation, and it acts with much more force than its congener the pronator teres.\n\n**Sect. VII. The Muscles which move the Carpus upon the Fore-arm.**\n\n**Ulnaris.**\n\nThis is a long muscle, fleshy at its upper extremity, and tendinous at the other, situated on the outer part of the ulna.\n\nIt is fixed by its upper part in the backside of the long or internal condyle of the os humeri, in that part of the olecranon which is next the condyle, along the upper half of the ulna very nearly; and to the middle common tendon of the neighbouring muscle, termed commonly profundus.\n\nIt runs in the direction of the external angle of the ulna, and ends by a long tendon, in the os piliforme or orbiculare of the carpus, reaching likewise to the os uniciforme, being united to the ligament common to these two bones.\n\n**Radialis Internus.**\n\nThis is a long muscle very like the foregoing, but situated more obliquely.\n\nIts fleshy portion is fixed, by a short tendon, to the outer and upper side of the inner condyle of the os humeri. From thence it passes obliquely toward the radius; and running along about two thirds of that bone, it forms a long tendon, which passes under a particular annular ligament, and under the insertion of the musculus thenar.\n\nThis tendon is at length inserted chiefly in the inside of the basis of the first metacarpal bone, and often in the second likewise, and a little in the first phalanx of the thumb, having first passed through the channel of the os trapezium, which sustains the thumb.\n\n**Ulnaris.**","sp":237,"ep":240},{"h":"INTEROSSEI","t":"These are small muscles, lying between the metacarpal bones, and filling the three interstices left between them, both exteriorly, or towards the back of the hand, and interiorly, or toward the palm of the hand. From this situation they have the name of interossei, and have been divided into external and internal. They are commonly reckoned six in number, three external, and three internal.\n\nThe first two external interossei are for the most part inserted in the middle finger. They fill the interstices between the three first metacarpal bones, and surround the middle bone all the way to the hollow of the hand. Their tendons are fixed in both sides of the first phalanx, and in both sides of the second tendon of the extensor communis.\n\nThe third external interosseus lies in the interstice betwixt the two last metacarpal bones, and is most commonly inserted in the ring finger; its tendon being fixed in that side of the first phalanx farthest from the thumb, and in the corresponding edge of the third tendon of the extensor communis. The fleshy body of this muscle runs in between the two bones toward the hollow of the hand.\n\nThe internal interossei are more simple than the former, and do not lie so much between the bones. The tendon of the first is inserted in the side of the first phalanx of the forefinger, next the little finger, and in the corresponding edge of the extensor communis. The tendon of the second goes in the same manner to the side of the ring-finger next to the thumb; and the third, to the same side of the little finger.\n\nThere are therefore two external interossei for the middle finger, one for the ring finger, but none for the fore and little finger. The middle finger has no internal interosseus; but the index, ring finger, and little finger, have each of them one.","sp":244,"ep":244},{"h":"INTESTINUM COLON","t":"The colon is the most considerable of all the intestines. From the c\u00e6cum, of which it is a continuation, it reaches, in form of an arch, above the umbilical region, and to the lower part of the left hypochondrium. Its continuity is however a little interrupted by the ileum, which advances into the cavity of the colon, and, together with a certain fold of that intestine, forms what is called valvula coli.\n\nThe whole convex side of the colon is divided longitudinally into three parts, by three ligamentary bands, continued from those of the c\u00e6cum, and of the same structure with these. Two of the three bands run on each side, along the great curvature of the colon; and the third along the small curvature.\n\nThese three longitudinal bands do the office of fren\u00e6, between which this intestine is through its whole length alternately depressed into transverse folds, and raised into considerable eminences. All the folds are duplicatures, which form portions of valvulae conniventes in the cavity of the intestine; and the eminences form receptacles, called the cells of the colon.\n\nThe common coat, on one side, is a continuation of the mesocolon; and, on the other side, it contributes, by the same continuation, to form the omentum.\n\nThe arch of the colon begins under the right kidney, near the haunch. It runs up on the foreside of that kidney to which it is connected, passes under the vesicula f\u00e6llis, which tinges it with a yellow colour at that place, and continues its course before the first incursion of the duodenum, to which it adheres, and partly hides it. In this part of its course, therefore, there is a remarkable connexion between the colon, duodenum, right kidney, and vesicula f\u00e6llis.\n\nFrom thence the arch of the colon runs before the great convexity of the stomach, and sometimes a little lower; then turns backward under the spleen, in the left hypochondrium; runs down on the foreside of the left kidney, to which it is connected; below this kidney turns toward the vertebrae, and terminates there by a double incursion, or by two opposite convolutions, which represent in some measure an inverted roman S.\n\nAt the place where the c\u00e6cum joins the colon, one portion of the circumference of both is depressed, and forms a large fold on the inside, which advances into the cavity of the intestine. It is a little open in the middle, and its extremities are very thick, by reason of the mutual duplicature of the coats of the c\u00e6cum and colon.\n\nThe extremity of the ileum is as it were grafted in the opening of this fold, and strongly united to its sides by the adhesion of its transverse fibres to the transverse fibres of the c\u00e6cum and colon.\n\nThis union forms a pretty thick ring, which likewise advances into the common cavity of the c\u00e6cum and colon, where it is wrinkled or formed into gathers, almost like the lower extremity of the oesophagus, the pylorus or inside of the anus. Its circumference is more or less oval; and, by a kind of continuity with the common fold of the c\u00e6cum and colon, it forms two productions, which M. Morgagni calls the fren\u00e6 of the valvula coli.\n\nThe membranous coat of the extremity of the ileum is continued on the c\u00e6cum and colon, without sinking into any fold, at the place where the ileum enters the colon.\n\nThis valvula coli is contrived to hinder the return of the excrements into the ileum; it produces this effect partly as a valve, and partly as a kind of sphincter.\n\nThe capacious arch of the colon is contracted by both extremities to the regio lumbaris, near the kidneys, by two particular ligaments, one on the right side, the other on the left, which are only small duplicatures of the peritoneum, more or less transverse.\n\nThe remaining portion, which forms the two convolutions in form of the roman S, contracts below the left kidney, being narrower there, than lower down. The coats of this portion become gradually thicker and stronger, and likewise the ligamentary bands, which approach each other by degrees, and seem to increase in breadth.","sp":306,"ep":307},{"h":"INTESTINUM RECTUM AND ANUS","t":"The last of all the intestines, is named rectum, or the straight gut, which, properly speaking, is a true continuation of the last convolution of the colon; and it is the repository, sink, and common sewer, of the whole intestinal canal.\n\nThe rectum having passed below the last vertebra of the loins, to the inside of the os sacrum, is bent backward on that concave side to which it is connected; and having reached the os coccygis, it runs likewise in the direction of that bone, and bends a little forward, terminating beyond the extremity of the coccyx.\n\nThe figure of this intestine varies according as it is full or empty. When empty, it is irregularly cylindrical, and links in by a kind of transverse folds; and in that state, it is about three fingers breadth in diameter, more or less. When full, it is wider in proportion to the quantity of faeces, wind, or whatever else is contained in it; and it may be extended to the size of a large bladder, so as to represent a kind of stomach.\n\nThe membranous coat often contains a great quantity of fat, spread between it and the muscular coat, and forming round the intestine numerous eminences, in the room of the appendices adipof\u00e6 of the colon.\n\nThe muscular or fleshy coat is very thick: the longitudinal fibres, which in the other intestines are very thin, are in this stronger than the circular fibres of the rectum. The ligamentary bands continue to increase in breadth, and to approach each other.\n\nThe nervous or filamentous and internal coats, are larger here, than in the other intestines; and when the rectum is empty, they form a great number of waving ruge in its cavity, which disappear, in proportion as that cavity is filled.\n\nThe innermost coat is very improperly termed villosa, and scarce deserves the name of papillaris, because of the smallness of the little corpules spread on its surface.\nIt contains a great number of single or solitary glands; and it is always moistened by a mucus of different consistencies discharged by these glands or folliculi.\n\nNear the extremity of this intestine, the rugae or folds become in a manner longitudinal; and at last, towards the circumference of the inner margin of the anus, they form little bags or semilunar lacunae, the openings of which are turned upward, toward the cavity of the intestine. These lacunae are something like those at the lower extremity of the oesophagus, or upper orifice of the stomach.\n\nAt length the extremity of the rectum contracts, and terminates by a narrow orifice called the anus, the sides of which are disposed in close folds or gathers. This extremity of the intestine has several muscles belonging to it, some of which surround it like sphincters, the rest are broad fleshy planes inserted in it, and which being likewise fixed to other parts, sustain it in its natural situation, and restores it to that situation when disturbed by the force necessary for the exclusion of the faeces. These latter muscles are termed levatores ani, the first go by the general name of sphincters.\n\nThese sphincters are three in number, one intestinal or orbicular, and two cutaneous or oval; whereof one is large, superior, and internal; the other small, inferior, and external.\n\nThe intestinal or orbicular sphincter of the anus, consists merely in an augmentation of the inferior portion of the fleshy fibres of the extremity of the rectum.\n\nThe cutaneous ligament goes out anteriorly, from the extremity of the os coccygis. It is very slender, and divides into two portions at the orifice of the anus, which run into the membrana adiposa, and are inserted in the skin on each side of the anus, by a kind of expansion; and continuing to divericate, they are lost on the two sides of the peritoneum.\n\nThe interosseous ligament of the os pubis is a very strong triangular membrane, fixed by two of its edges in the inferior rami of these bones, all the way up to their common symphysis. The third edge, which is the lowest, is loose; and this whole membrane, the middle of which is perforated by a particular hole, is stretched very tight between the two bones, and under their cartilaginous arch, to which it adheres very closely.\n\nAt the lower part of this interosseous ligament, along its whole lower or loose edge, lies a digastric muscle, fixed by its two extremities in the rami of the os pubis, its middle tendon lying on the middle of the edge of the ligament.\n\nThe cutaneous sphincters have each an anterior and posterior insertion, ending both ways in a kind of point, and comprehending the orifice of the anus between their middle portions.\n\nThey are distinguished from each other by their situation, by their size, and by a kind of white cellular line. The greatest of the two appears to be double, and the smallest lies nearest the skin, and adheres most closely to it.\n\nThey are inserted backward, partly in the apex of the os coccygis, and partly in the contiguous portion of the cutaneous ligament of that bone. Forward their chief insertion is in the middle tendon of the transversalis urethrae; and they have likewise some connexions to other muscles of the urethra.\n\nThe levatores ani are broad, thin, muscular portions, fixed by one extremity of their fleshy fibres round the concave side of the inferior portion of the pelvis, from the symphysis of the os pubis, beyond the spine of the ilium. The other extremity of these fibres runs down on each side behind, and under the curvature of the end of the rectum, where they meet together, and unite from the basis of the os coccygis all the way to the margin of the anus.\n\nWe ought likewise to remark, that the margin or edge of the anus is formed by the union of the skin and epidermis with the internal coat of the rectum; so that the most superficial portion of that coat seems to be a continuation of the epidermis.\n\nMESENTERIUM & MESOCOLON.\n\nThis great bundle of intestines is not left to move at random in the cavity of the abdomen; but artfully bound down by a membranous web, which prevents the intestinal convolutions from being entangled in each other, and from being twisted or compressed in all their different ways of meeting; and yet allows them a gentle floating, but limited motion.\n\nThis web is distinguished into two portions; one of which, being very broad and very much plaited, connects the small intestines; the other, which is long and incurvated, does the same office to the greater intestines.\n\nThese two portions are in reality only one and the same continuation of the membranous lamina of the peritoneum doubled back upon itself; and they are distinguished only by their breadth. Taken both together, they form a kind of spiral roll, more or less plaited in its circumference. The first portion has retained the name of mesentery, the other is termed mesocolon.\n\nThe mesentery begins at the last incursion of the duodenum, and runs obliquely from left to right, along the vertebrae of the loins. In this space, the membranous portion of the peritoneum is detached on both hands, produces a duplicature by two elongations or particular laminae applied to each other, and thus forms the mesentery.\n\nIt is narrow at its upper and lower parts, but chiefly at the upper. The middle portion is very broad, and the edge of it next the intestines is everywhere very much plaited. These plaits or folds are only waving inflections, such as may be observed in the edge of a piece of shawmoy, which has been often drawn through the fingers. They make this edge of the mesentery very long, and they run through about one third of its breadth.\n\nThe two laminae are joined together by a cellular substance, which contains glands, vessels, and nerves; and in some subjects a great quantity of fat, which keeps the two laminae a distance from each other.\n\nAlong the whole circumference of the mesentery, the two laminae are naturally separated, and applied to the two sides of the small intestines, which they invest by their union, or rather reciprocal continuation on the great curvature\ncurvature of that canal, and carry it as in a scarf or sling. This is what forms the external or membranous coat of the intestine.\n\nThe mesocolon is the continuation of the mesentery, which having reached the extremity of the ilium, contracts and changes its name. At this place the particular lamina which is turned to the right side, forms a small transverse fold, called ligamentum coli dextrum.\n\nAfterwards the mesocolon ascends towards the right kidney, where it seems to be lost by the immediate adhesion of the colon to that kidney, and to the first incursion of the duodenum. Then it appears again, and, increasing in breadth, it continues its course almost transversely under the liver, stomach, and spleen, where it begins to turn downward, under the left hypochondrium, toward the kidney on the same side.\n\nThrough this whole course, the mesocolon extends in breadth, and forms nearly a transverse semicircular plane, very little plaited at its great circumference. By this circumference or edge, it is connected to the colon; and hides that ligamentary band of this intestine, which runs along its small curvature. By its short or small edge, it forms the triangular case of the duodenum; and by its great edge, the external coat of the colon, in the same manner as the mesentery does that of the small intestine. As it passes under the large extremity of the stomach, it adheres a little to the lower portion of that extremity, as the diaphragm does to the upper.\n\nHaving got below the left kidney, it contracts and forms another transverse fold, called ligamentum coli sinistrum. Afterwards it expands again, but not so much as in the upper part, and runs down on the left psoas muscle, toward the last vertebra of the loins. This descending portion is fixed to the convolutions of the colon in the same manner as the superior portion is to the arch of that intestine.\n\nThe intestine rectum is likewise invested by a particular production of the peritoneum, called commonly by the barbarous name of mesorectum. This production is very narrow; and, about the middle of the foreside of the rectum, it forms a transverse semicircular fold, which appears when the intestine is empty, but is lost when it is filled.\n\nGLANDUL\u00c6 MESENTERIC\u00c6, VASA LYMPHATICA & LACTEA.\n\nBetween the laminae of the mesentery, a great number of glands lie scattered through the cellular substance. In the natural state, these glands are something of the figure of lentils or little round beans; some of them being orbicular, others oval, but all of them a little flattened.\n\nThese glands are of the number of those that anatomists call glandulae conglomerate, the structure of which is not as yet sufficiently known. They seem to be of a cellular substance, surrounded by a very fine membrane or coat, on which, by the help of microscopes, we discover an intertexture of particular filaments.\n\nBesides the blood-vessels which are distributed in a reticular manner in the mesenteric glands, and besides many nervous filaments spread through them, we discover an infinite number of small vessels of another kind running from gland to gland.\n\nThese vessels are extremely thin and transparent, and furnished on the inside with numerous valves, which appear on the outside like little small knots very near each other. They go out from each gland by ramifications, as by so many roots, and having formed a small trunk, they are again divided, and enter some neighbouring gland by the same kind of ramifications by which they went out from the former.\n\nThey are termed lymphatic vessels, because for the most part they contain a very clear, limpid, though mucilaginous serum, called lympha by anatomists. But as they have likewise been observed to be filled with a white milky fluid, called chyle, they have been called vasa chylifera, or vene lactae. They have the name of veins, because their valves are disposed as those of the ordinary blood-veins, and because the fluid which they contain runs from smaller into larger tubes.\n\nThey derive their first origin from the tunica villosa of the intestine, and chiefly from that of the small intestine, by a great number of small capillary roots. From these roots there arises, between the coats of the intestine, a kind of rete mirabile, which surrounds almost the whole circumference of the intestinal canal, between the muscular and external coat.\n\nThis reticular texture of lacteal vessels keeps close to the external coat, and leaves the canal along with it, on the side of the mesentery, where it forms two planes of ramifications, plainly distinguished from each other by the cellular substance, and adhering closely to the inside of the two membranes of the mesentery. In this separate state they run on the laminae of the mesentery, as far as the first mesenteric glands, where they unite again into one plane.\n\nAfter this union, the lacteal vessels are distributed almost uniformly through the whole extent of the mesentery, from its circumference to its origin or adhesion to the vertebrae of the back, between the mesenteric glands, which they join, and form frequent anastomoses or communications.\n\nHaving passed through the mesentery, the ramifications begin to unite as they approach the spina dorsi, and consequently their number is lessened, and their size increased; and having passed the last mesenteric glands, they terminate about the middle of the adhesion of the melocolon in small common trunks, which receive a great number of lymphatic vessels from the glandulae lumbares, and others below these.\n\nThe lacteal vessels which lie between the mesenteric glands and middle adhesion of the mesocolon to the spina dorsi, run down on the body of the inferior aorta, between the extremities of the small muscle of the diaphragm, and terminate in a kind of cistern, called by some receptaculum chyli, by others receptaculum Pecqueti.\n\nThe greatest part of the receptaculum chyli lies behind the right portion of the inferior muscle of the diaphragm, on the right side of the aorta, at the union of the last vertebra of the back with the first of the loins. It is a kind of membranous vehicle, the conformation of which is various in human subjects. Sometimes it is of\nan uniform long oval figure, like the vesicula fellis; sometimes it is divided by strictures, into several small roundish bags more or less flattened, and sometimes it surrounds the trunk of the aorta like a collar.\n\nIt is composed of very thin coats, and its cavity is divided by small pellicular or membranous septa, the disposition of which is irregular. It is chiefly round the lower part of this receptacle, that the lacteal vessels are inserted, some on the sides, and some behind the aorta; and they are accompanied by numerous lymphatic vessels. The upper portion is contracted between the aorta and vena azygos, and forms a particular canal, which runs up through the thorax, by the name of ductus thoracicus.\n\nHEPAR & VESICULA FELLIS.\n\nThe liver is a large and pretty solid mass, of a dark red colour, a little inclined to yellow, situated immediately under the arch of the diaphragm, partly in the right hypochondrium, which it fills almost entirely, and partly in the epigastrium, between the appendix ensiformis and spina dorfi, and terminating commonly in the left hypochondrium.\n\nThe figure of the liver is irregular, it being arched or convex on the upper part, unequally concave on the lower, and very thick on the right and back sides. Towards the left and anterior sides its thickness decreases very much, and terminates there by a kind of edge; and it is broader from right to left, than from before backwards.\n\nIt may be divided into lateral parts called lobes; one of which is termed the great or right lobe; the other, the small or left lobe. These two lobes are distinguished above, by a membranous ligament; and below very plainly, by a considerable fissure lying in the same direction with the superior ligament.\n\nThe eminences on the concave side of the liver belong to the great lobe. The principal eminence is a sort of triangular or pyramidal apophysis situated backward near the great fissure which distinguishes the two lobes.\n\nThis triangular eminence is termed lobulus Spigelii, or simply the small lobe of the liver. One of its angles advances a considerable way toward the middle of the lower side of the great lobe, and is lost there. Toward the foreside, there is another eminence less prominent but broader; and to this eminence and the former, the ancients gave the general name of porta.\n\nThe depressions on the concave or lower side of the liver are four in number. The first is the fissure that separates the two lobes, which runs across the concave side, from the eminences already mentioned, to the anterior edge, where it terminates by a notch of different depths in different subjects. This is termed the great fissure of the liver.\n\nThe second depression is situated transversely between the two eminences of the great lobe, and filled by the sinus of the vena porta. The third depression is backward, between the great lobe and lobulus Spigelii, and the vena cava passes through it. The fourth is a kind of sulcus between the lobulus and small lobe of the liver, which in the fetus served to receive a venal canal lost in adults, in whom it appears only as a kind of ligament. This sulcus is in some measure a continuation of the great fissure, and joins the vena cava by an acute angle.\n\nBesides these four depressions, there is one on the fore-part of the great lobe, in which the vesicula fellis is lodged; and it sometimes runs as far as the edge, where it forms a small notch. We may likewise reckon among these depressions, a small superficial cavity in the posterior and lateral part of the lower side of the great lobe, by which it rests on the right kidney; and likewise a superficial cavity in the left lobe, where it runs over the stomach.\n\nLastly, on the posterior edge of the liver, there is a great sinus common to both lobes, which gives passage to the spina dorfi and oesophagus, near the place where the vena cava descends.\n\nThe convex side of the liver is commonly connected to the diaphragm by three ligaments, which are only continuations of the membranous lamina of the peritoneum. One lies near the edge of the extremity of each lobe, and one in the middle, and they are accordingly termed the right, middle, and left ligaments. There is a cellular substance in the duplicature of each, in which the blood-vessels and lymphatics run, and which sends off a kind of lamina into the substance of the liver.\n\nThe right ligament sometimes connects the great lobe to the cartilages of the false ribs; and the left ligament, or that of the small lobe, is often double, and advances toward the middle ligament. This middle ligament begins low, in the great fissure of the liver, near the eminences called porta, and from thence passes thro' the anterior notch and over the convex side of the liver at the union of the two lobes, and is fixed obliquely in the diaphragm.\n\nIt is likewise fixed along the upper and inner part of the vagina of the right musculus rectus of the abdomen, in such an oblique manner as to be nearer the linea alba below than above.\n\nBesides these ligaments the great lobe of the liver is likewise connected to the right ala of the tendinous portion of the diaphragm, not by a ligament, but by a broad and immediate adhesion, without the intervention of the membrane of the peritoneum, which is only folded quite round this adhesion, to form the external membrane of all the rest of the body of the liver.\n\nThe middle ligament, called improperly ligamentum hepatis suspensorium, contains in its duplicature a thick white rope, like a round ligament, which was the umbilical vein in the fetus. Thus the lower part represents a falx, the convex edge of which is sharp, and the other rounded.\n\nAll these ligaments serve to keep the liver in its proper situation, and to hinder it from inclining too much towards either side: But we must not imagine that any of them serve to suspend it; because it is sufficiently supported by the stomach and intestines, especially when they are filled.\n\nWhen the stomach is empty, or when we fast longer than ordinary, it is a common expression to say the stomach pinches us. As the liver is not then sustained by the stomach and intestines, it defends by its own weight, and\nand chiefly by the means of the middle ligament pulls the diaphragm along with it. It is in that place therefore that we have this uneasy sensation, and not at the superior orifice of the stomach, as is commonly believed.\n\nThe liver is composed of several kinds of vessels, the ramifications of which are multiplied in an astonishing manner, and form by the intertexture of their capillary extremities, an innumerable collection of small pulpy, friable corpuscles, which are looked upon to be so many organs designed to separate from the mass of blood a particular fluid termed the bile.\n\nThe greatest part of these vessels from one end to the other is included in a membranous vagina called capsula vena portae, or capsula Glissoni.\n\nThe trunk of the vena portae is situated transversely between the broad anterior eminence of the great lobe of the liver, and the root of the lobulus, in a particular fissure, and forms what is called the sinus of the vena portae. From this sinus five principal branches go out, which afterwards divided into millions of ramifications through the whole substance of the liver.\n\nAt this place the vena portae lays down the common office of a vein, and becomes a kind of artery as it enters, and is again ramified in the liver. The extremities of all these ramifications of the trunk of the vena portae hepatica end in the pulpy friable corpuscles which seem to be thick villous folliculi.\n\nIts in these folliculi that the bile is secreted, and it is immediately collected in the same number of extremities of another kind of vessels, which unite by numerous ramifications into one common trunk. These ramifications are termed porti bilarii, and the trunk ductus hepaticus; and the ramifications of these two kinds of vessels are invested together by the capsula of the vena portae.\n\nThe blood, deprived of this bilious fluid, is reconveyed to the heart by a great number of venal ramifications, which afterwards unite into three principal branches, besides others that are less considerable, that terminate in the vena cava, and are all called by the name of vena hepatica.\n\nThe capillary extremities of the ramifications of the vena cava, join those of the vena portae, and accompany them through the liver; and yet the great branches of both veins intersect each other in several places.\n\nThe ductus hepaticus, or trunk of the porti bilarii, having run a little way, joins another canal called ductus cysticus or vesicularis, because it comes from the vesicula fellea. These two united ducts form a common trunk named ductus cholidochus, because it conveys the bile. This duct having reached the incursion of the duodenum, infiltrates itself through the coats of that intestine, and opens into the cavity thereof, not by a round papilla, but by an oblong orifice, rounded at the upper part, and contracted at the lower, like the spout of an ewer, or like a common tooth-picker.\n\nThe gall-bladder is a kind of small bag shaped like a pear, that is, narrow at one end and wide at the other. The wide extremity is termed the fundus or bottom, the narrow extremity the neck, and the middle portion the body. About one third of the body of the vesicula lies in a depression on the concave side of the liver, from the trunk or sinus of the vena portae, where the neck is situated to the anterior edge of the great lobe, a little toward the right side, where the bottom is placed.\n\nThe gall-bladder is composed of several coats; the outermost of which is a continuation of that which invests the liver, and consequently of the peritoneum.\n\nThe second coat is fleshy, and made up of two strata, one longitudinal, the other transverse, the fibres of which have nearly the same irregular direction with those of the stomach; and this disposition of the fibres in these viscera is owing to the different diameters in the several portions of them, and to their incurvation.\n\nThese two coats are connected by a cellular substance continued between the body of the vesicula and the liver, all the way, to a whitish stratum, which is looked upon as the third coat of the gall-bladder answering to the tunica nervosa of the intestine.\n\nThe innermost or fourth coat has on the inside a great number of reticular folds, filled with small lacunae, like perforated papill\u00e6, especially near the neck of the vesicula where these folds are longitudinal, and afterwards form a kind of small pylorus with plaits of the same nature with those in the great one. These lacun\u00e6 are looked upon to be glands.\n\nThat side of the body of the vesicula which lies next the liver is connected to that viscus by a vast number of filaments, which run a great way into the substance of the liver; and among these filaments there are some ducts which form a communication between the porti bilarii and vesicula. They are most numerous near the neck of the vesicula, and they are named ductus cysto-hepatici, or hepatico-cystici.\n\nThe neck of the vesicula is formed by the contraction of the small extremity; and this neck bending afterwards in a particular manner, produces a narrow canal named ductus cysticus.\n\nThe neck of the vesicula is nearly of the same structure with the other parts. It has on the inside several reticular rug\u00e6 and some folds which appear like fragments of valvulae conniventes, situated very near each other, from the neck to the contraction of the cystic duct. The first of these folds is pretty broad and large, and almost circular; the next is more oblique, and smaller in size; and the rest diminish in the same manner.\n\nThe bile which passes through the ductus hepaticus into the cholidochus, may be called hepatic; and that which is collected in the vesicula fellea, may be termed cystic. The hepatic bile flows continually through the ductus cholidochus into the duodenum, whereas the cystic bile flows only by reason of plentitude or by compression.\n\nThe uses of the liver shall be explained after the description of pancreas, spleen, and omentum, all these viscera having a great relation to the liver.","sp":307,"ep":315},{"h":"LATISSIMUS DORSI","t":"This is a broad, thin, and mostly fleshy muscle, lying between the axilla, where it is very narrow, and the back on which it expands itself by radiated fibres, both in length and breadth, from the middle of the back all the way to the lower part of the regio lumbaris; and from this situation it has its name.\n\nIts insertions are partly tendinous, and partly fleshy. In the first place, it is sometimes, but not always, fixed in the inferior costa of the scapula near the angle, by a fasciculus of fleshy fibres.

Then they pass on to the same sides of the first phalanges, and join the tendons of the extensor communis; each of them being connected with the nearest portion thereof, at the articulation of the first phalanx with the second.","sp":244,"ep":244},{"h":"MEDULLA OBLONGATA","t":"The medulla oblongata is a medullary substance situated from before backward in the middle part of the bases of the cerebrum and cerebellum without any discontinuation; between the lateral parts of both these bases; and therefore it may be looked upon as one middle medullary basis common to both cerebrum and cerebellum, by the reciprocal continuity of their medullary substances, through the great notch in the transverse septum of the dura mater; which common basis lies immediately on that portion of the dura mater which lines the basis of the cranium. The medulla oblongata is therefore justly esteemed to be a third general part of the whole mass of the brain, or as the common production or united elongation of the whole medullary substance of the cerebrum and cerebellum.\n\nIt is extremely difficult, if not altogether impossible, to examine or demonstrate it as we ought, in its natural situation; but we are obliged to do both on a brain inverted.\n\nThe lower side of the medulla oblongata in an inverted situation, presents to our view several parts which are in general either medullary productions, trunks of nerves, or trunks of blood vessels.\n\nThe chief medullary productions are these: The large or anterior branches of the medulla oblongata; which have likewise been named crura anteriora, femora, and brachia medullae oblongatae, and pedunculi cerebri: The transverse protuberance, called likewise processus annularis, or pons varolii: The small or posterior branches, called pedunculi cerebri, or crura posteriores medullae oblongatae: The extremity or cauda of the medulla oblongata, with two pairs of tubercles, one of which is named corpora olivaria, the other corpora pyramidalia; and to all these productions we must add a production of the infundibulum and two medullary papillae.\n\nThe great branches of the medulla oblongata are two very considerable medullary fasciculi, the anterior extremities of which are separated, and the posterior united, so that, taken both together, they represent a Roman V.\n\nThe transverse, annular, or rather semi-annular protuberance, is a medullary production, which seems at first sight to surround the posterior extremities of the great branches; but the medullary substance of this protuberance is in reality intimately mixed with that of the two former. Varolius, an ancient Italian author, viewing those parts in an inverted situation, compared the two branches to two rivers, and the protuberance to a bridge over them both, and from thence it has the name of pons Varolii.\n\nThe small branches of the medulla oblongata are lateral productions of the transverse protuberance, which by their roots seem to compass that medullary portion in which the fourth ventricle or calamus scriptorius is formed.\n\nThe extremity is no more than the medulla oblongata contracted in its passage backward to the anterior edge of the great foramen of the os occipitis, where it terminates in the medulla spinalis; and in this part of it several things are to be taken notice of. We see first of all, four eminences, two named corpora olivaria, and the other two corpora pyramidalia. Immediately afterwards, it is divided into two lateral portions by two narrow grooves, one on the upper side, the other on the lower. They both run into the substance of the medulla, as between two cylinders, flattened on that side by which they are joined together.\n\nWhen we separate these ridges with the fingers, we observe a crucial intertexture of several small medullary cords.\ncords, which go obliquely from the substance of one lateral portion into the substance of the other.\n\nThe corpora olivaria and pyramidalia are whitish eminences situated longitudinally near each other on the lower side of the extremity or cauda, immediately behind the transverse or annular protuberances. The corpora olivaria are in the middle, so that the interstice between them, which is a kind of superficial groove, answers to the inferior groove of the following portion.\n\nThe corpora pyramidalia are two lateral eminences depending on the olivaria. These four eminences are situated on the lower half of the medulla.\n\nThe tubercula mammillaria, or papillae medullares, which are situated very near the production of the infundibulum, have been taken for glands.\n\nThese tubercles seem to have some immediate relation to the roots or bases of the anterior pillar of the fornix.\n\nThe beak or tube of the infundibulum is a very thin production from the sides of that cavity; and it is strengthened by a particular coat given to it by the pia mater. It is bent a little from behind forward, toward the glandula pinealis, and afterwards expands again round this gland.\n\nThe membrana arachnoidea, or external lamina of the pia mater, appears to be very distinctly separated from the internal lamina, in the interstices between all these eminences on the lower side of the medulla oblongata, without any visible cellular substance between them.\n\nFrom this medulla oblongata, arise almost all the nerves which go out of the cranium through the different foramina by which its basis is perforated. It likewise produces the medulla spinalis, which is no more than a common elongation of the cerebrum and cerebellum, and of their different substances; and therefore the medulla oblongata may justly be said to be the first origin or primitive source of all the nerves of the human body.\n\n**MEDULLA SPINALIS.**\n\nThe medulla spinalis is only an elongation of the extremity of the medulla oblongata; and it has its name from its being contained in the bony canal of the spina dorsif; consequently a continuation or common appendix of the cerebrum or cerebellum, as well because of the two substances of which it is composed, as because of the membranes by which it is invested.\n\nThe dura mater, after it has lined the whole internal surface of the cranium, goes out by the great occipital foramen, and forms a kind of funnel, in its progress downward through the bony canal of the vertebrae.\n\nThe spinal marrow is made up of a cortical and medullary substance, as the cerebrum and cerebellum; but with this difference, that the ash-colored substance lies within the other; and in a transverse section of this medulla, the inner substance appears to be of the figure of an horse-hoe.\n\nThe body of the medulla spinalis runs down all the way to the first vertebra of the loins, where it terminates in a point. The size of it is proportionable to that of the bony canal, so that it is larger in the vertebrae of the neck than those of the back.\n\nIt sends off from both the fore and back sides, at different distances, flat fasciculi of nervous filaments. The anterior and posterior fasciculi having got a little beyond the edge of the medulla, unite in pairs, and form on each side a kind of knots, called ganglia by anatomists, each of which produces a nervous trunk. These ganglia are made up of a mixture of cortical and medullary substance, accompanied by a great number of small bloodvessels.\n\nThe dura mater, which invests the medulla, sends out on each side the same number of vaginae as there are ganglia and nervous trunks. These vaginae are productions of the external lamina; the internal lamina, which is very smooth and polished on the inside, being perforated by two small holes very near each other, where each vagina goes off, through which holes the extremities of each anterior and posterior fasciculus are transmitted; and immediately after their passage through the internal lamina, they unite.\n\n**USES OF THE BRAIN AND ITS APPENDAGES IN GENERAL.**\n\nMALPHIGHI was the first who discovered the brain to be a gland, or an organ fitted to separate some particular fluid from the mass of blood.\n\nThe infinite number of small secretory clusters strain or filter the mass of blood carried to them by the numerous ramifications, and separate from it an excessively fine fluid; the remaining blood being conveyed back by the same number of venal extremities, into the sinuses of the dura mater, and from thence into the jugular and vertebral veins.\n\nThis subtile fluid, commonly called animal spirit, nervous juice, or liquor of the nerves, is continually forced into the medullary fibres of the white portion of the cerebrum, cerebellum, medulla oblongata, and medulla spinalis; and by the intervention of these fibres supplies and fills the nerves, which are a continuation of them.\n\n**PERICRANIUM.**\n\nBESIDES the external integuments of the head, the skin, hair, and cellular substance, there is an aponeurotic expansion which covers the head like a cap, and is spread round the neck and on the shoulders like a riding-hood.\n\nThis aponeurosis is very strong on the head, and it appears to be made up at least of two strata of fibres crossing each other. As it is spread on the neck it becomes gradually thinner, and ends indefinably on the clavicles. It sends out a production on each side, from above downward, and from without inward, which having passed over the superior extremity of the musculus sternomastoideus, runs behind that muscle toward the transverse apophysis of the vertebrae of the neck, where it communicates with the ligamenta inter-transversalia.\n\nThe external surface of all the bones of the head, as\nwell as of all the other bones of the human body, except the teeth, is covered by a particular membrane, of which that portion which particularly invests the cranium is named pericranium, and that which invests the bones of the face is simply termed periosteum.\n\nThe pericranium is made up of two laminae closely united together. The internal lamina, which has by some been taken for a particular periosteum, covers immediately all the bony parts of this region; and the external lamina has been looked upon as a membrane distinct from the internal, and named pericranium particularly.\n\nSect. V. Of the Eye.\n\nThe Globe or Ball of the Eye.\n\nThe globe of the eye is made up of several proper parts, some of which being more or less solid, represent a kind of shell formed by the union of several membranous strata called the coats of the globe of the eye; and the other parts being more or less fluid, and contained in particular membranous capsules, or in the interstices between the coats, are termed the humours of the globe of the eye. These capsules are likewise termed coats.\n\nThe coats of the globe of the eye are of three kinds. Some form chiefly the shell of the globe; some are additional, being fixed only to a part of the globe; and some are capsular, which contain the humours. The coats which form the shell are three in number. The external is termed tunica sclerotica or cornea; the middle coat is named choroides; and the third or innermost, retina. The additional coats are two; one called tendinosa or albuginea, which forms the white of the eye; and the other, conjunctiva. The capsular tunic\u00e6 are likewise two, the vitrea, and crystallina.\n\nThe Coats of the Eye.\n\nThe most external, thickest, and strongest coat of the eye is the sclerotica or cornea, and it invests all the other parts of which the globe is composed. It is divided into two portions, one called cornea opaca, the other cornea lucida; which is only a small segment of a sphere, situated anteriorly.\n\nThe cornea opaca is made up of several strata closely connected together, and is of an hard compact texture resembling parchment. About the middle of its posterior convex portion, where it sustains the optic nerve, it is in a manner perforated, and thicker than anywhere else.\n\nThe cornea lucida is made up in the like manner of several strata or laminae closely united, and appears to be a continuation of the opaque portion or sclerotica, though of a different texture.\n\nThis portion is something more convex than the cornea opaca, so that it represents the segment of a small sphere added to the segment of a greater.\n\nThe cornea lucida is perforated by a great number of imperceptible pores, through which a very fine fluid is continually discharged, which soon afterwards evaporates.\n\nThe second coat of the globe of the eye is the choroides, which is of a blackish colour, more or less inclined to red, and adheres, by means of a great number of small vessels, to the cornea opaca, from the insertion of the optic nerve, all the way to the union of the two corneas, where it leaves the circumference of the globe, and forms a perforated septum, by which the small segment of the globe is separated from the greater. This portion goes commonly by the particular name of uvea, which was formerly given to the whole second coat; and as it is of different colours in several subjects, it has likewise got the name of iris.\n\nThe anterior portion or perforated septum of the choroides has the name of uvea, and the hole near the centre of this septum is called pupilla. The anterior lamina of the same septum is termed iris, and the radiated plic\u00e6 of the posterior lamina, processus ciliares. Between the two laminae of the uvea, we find two very thin planes of fibres which appear to be fleecy, the fibres of one plane being orbicular, and lying round the circumference of the pupilla, and those of the other being radiated, one extremity of which is fixed to the orbicular plane, the other to the great edge of the uvea.\n\nThe plic\u00e6 or processus ciliares are small radiated and prominent duplicatures of the posterior lamina of the uvea, and their circumference answers partly to that of the white ring of the external lamina. They are oblong thin plates; their posterior extremities, or those next the choroides, being very fine and pointed; the others, or those next the pupilla, broad, prominent, and ending in acute angles.\n\nThe space between the cornea lucida and uvea contains the greatest part of the aqueous humour, and communicates by the pupilla with a very narrow space behind the uvea, or between that and the crystalline. These two spaces have been termed the two chambers of the aqueous humour, one anterior, the other posterior.\n\nThe third coat of the eye is of a very different texture from that of the other two coats. It is white, soft, and tender, and in a manner medullary, or like a kind of paste spread upon a fine reticular web. It appears to be thicker than the choroides, and reaches from the insertion of the optic nerve, to the extremities of the ciliary radii, being equally fixed to the choroides through its whole extent. At the place which answers to the insertion of the optic nerve, we observe a small depression, in which lies a sort of medullary button terminating in a point; and from this depression blood-vessels go out, which are ramified on all sides through the substance of the retina.\n\nThe Humours of the Eye and their Capsulae.\n\nThe vitreous humour is a clear and very liquid gelatinous fluid, contained in a fine transparent capsule, called tunica vitrea, together with which it forms a mass nearly of the consistence of the white of an egg. It fills the greatest part of the globe of the eye, that is, almost all that space which answers to the extent of the retina, except a small portion behind the uvea, where it forms a fossula, in which the crystalline is lodged.\n\nThe tunica vitrea is composed exteriorly of two laminae\nThe very closely connected, which quite surround the mass of humour, and are immediately applied to the retina, all the way to the great circumference of the corona ciliaris; but from thence to the circular edge of the fossula of the crystalline, this coat is full of radiated sulci, which contain the processus ciliares of the uvea.\n\nThe internal lamina of the tunica vitrea gives off, through the whole substance of this humour, a great number of cellular elongations or septa.\n\nThe radiated sulci of the tunica vitrea, which may be termed fasci ciliares, are perfectly black, when the coat is taken out of the body.\n\nThe crystalline is a small lenticular body, of a pretty firm consistence, and transparent like crystal. It is contained in a transparent membranous capsula, and lodged in the anterior fossula of the vitreous humour.\n\nThe figure of the crystalline is lenticular, but its posterior side is more convex than the anterior, the convexity of both sides being very rarely equal.\n\nThe crystalline capsula or coat is formed by a duplicature of the tunica vitrea. The external lamina covers the anterior side of the crystalline mass; the internal lamina covers the backside, and likewise the fossula vitrea, in which the crystalline is lodged.\n\nThe anterior portion swells when macerated in water, and then appears to be made up of two pelliculae, united by a fine fleshy substance.\n\nThe aqueous humour is a very limpid fluid, resembling a kind of lympha or serum, with a very small degree of viscosity; and it has no particular capsula like the crystalline and vitreous humours. It fills the space between the cornea lucida and uvea, that between the uvea and the crystalline, and the hole of the pupilla. These two spaces are called the chambers of the aqueous humour, and they are distinguished into the anterior and posterior.\n\nThe anterior chamber, which is visible to every body, between the cornea lucida and uvea, is the largest; the other between the uvea and crystalline is very narrow, especially near the pupilla, where the uvea almost touches the crystalline.\n\nThe Tunica Albuginea and Muscles of the Globe of the Eye.\n\nThe tunica albuginea, called commonly the white of the eye, and which appears on all the anterior convex side of the globe, from the cornea lucida, to the beginning of the posterior side, is formed chiefly by the tendinous expansion of four muscles.\n\nThere are commonly six muscles inserted in the globe of the human eye, and they are divided into four recti and two obliques. The recti are again divided, from their situation, into superior, inferior, internal, and external; and from their functions, into a levator, depressor, adductor, and abductor. The two oblique muscles are denominated from their situation and size, one being named obliquus superior or major, the other obliquus inferior, or minor. The obliquus major is likewise called trochlearis, because it passes through a small cartilaginous ring, as over a trochlea or pulley.\n\nThe musculi recti are fixed by their posterior extremities at the bottom of the orbit near the foramen opticum in the elongation of the dura mater, by short narrow tendons. From thence they run wholly fleshy, toward the great circumference of the convexity of the globe, between the optic nerve and cornea lucida, where they are expanded into flat broad tendons which touch each other, and afterwards unite. These tendons are fixed first of all by a particular insertion in the circumference just mentioned, and afterwards continue their adhesion all the way to the cornea, forming the tunica albuginea.\n\nThe superior oblique muscle is fixed to the bottom of the orbit, by a narrow tendon, in the same manner as the recti, between the rectus superior and internus. From thence it runs on the orbit opposite to the interstice between these two muscles, toward the internal angular apophysis of the os frontis, where it terminates in a thin tendon, which having passed through a kind of ring; as over a pulley, runs afterwards in a vagina obliquely backward under the rectus superior, that is between that muscle and the globe; and, increasing in breadth, it is inserted posteriorly and laterally in the globe, near the rectus externus.\n\nThe ring through which this muscle passes, is partly cartilaginous and partly ligamentary. The cartilaginous portion is flat, of a considerable breadth, and like half a ring. The ligamentary portion adheres strongly to the two ends of the cartilage, and is fixed in the small fossula which lies in the orbit, on the angular apophysis of the os frontis. By means of this ligament, the ring is in some measure moveable, and yields to the motions of the muscle. To the anterior edge of the ring, a ligamentary vagina is fixed, which invests the tendon all the way to its insertion in the globe.\n\nThe obliquus inferior is situated obliquely at the lower side of the orbit, under the rectus inferior, which consequently lies between this muscle and the globe. It is fixed by one extremity a little tendinous, to the root of the nasal apophysis of the os maxillare, near the edge of the orbit between the opening of the ductus nasalis, and the inferior orbital fissure.\n\nFrom thence it passes obliquely, and a little transversely backward, under the rectus inferior, and is fixed in the posterior lateral part of the globe by a flat tendon, opposite to, and at a small distance from the tendon of the obliquus superior, so that these two muscles do in some measure surround the outer posterior part of the globe.\n\nThe rectus superior moves the anterior portion of the globe upward when we lift up the eyes; the rectus inferior carries this portion downward; the internus, toward the nose; and the externus, toward the temples.\n\nWhen two neighbouring recti act at the same time, they carry the anterior portion of the globe obliquely toward that side which answers to the distance between these two muscles; and when all the four muscles act successively, they turn the globe of the eye round, which is what is called rolling the eyes.\n\nThe use of the oblique muscles is chiefly to counterbalance the action of the recti, and to support the globe in all the motions already mentioned. This is evident from their\ntheir insertions, which are in a contrary direction to those of the recti, their fixed points with relation to the motions of the globe being placed forward, and those of the recti backward, at the bottom of the orbit.\n\nThe rectus externus, by being bent on the globe, not only hinders it from being carried outward, but also prevents the indirect motions of the obliqui from thrusting it out of the orbit toward the temples.\n\nThe Supercilia, and Musculi Frontales, Occipitales, and Superciliares.\n\nThe supercilia, or eye-brows, are the two hairy arches situated at the lower part of the forehead, between the top of the nose and temples, in the same direction with the bony arches which form the superior edges of the orbits. Their colour is different in different persons, and often in the same person different from that of the hair on the head; the hairs of which they consist are strong and pretty stiff, and they lie obliquely, their roots being turned to the nose, and their points to the temples.\n\nThe supercilia have motions common to them with those of the skin of the forehead, and of the hairy scalp. By these motions the eye-brows are lifted up, the skin of the forehead is wrinkled more or less regularly and transversely; and the hair and almost the whole scalp is moved, but not in the same degree in all persons. The eye-brows have likewise particular motions which contract the skin above the nose; and all these different motions are performed by the following muscles.\n\nThe frontal muscles are two thin, broad, fleshy planes of unequal lengths, lying immediately behind the skin and membrana adiposa, on the anterior parts of the forehead, which parts they cover from the root of the nose, and through about two thirds of the arch of the eyebrows on each side, all the way to the lateral parts of the hair on the forehead. At the root of the nose they touch each other as if they were but one muscle; and at this place their fibres are short and longitudinal, or vertical.\n\nThese muscles are fixed by the inferior extremities of their fleshy fibres immediately in the skin, running thro' the membrana adiposa. They cover the musculi superciliares, and adhere closely to them by a kind of intertexture. By the same fibres they seem to be inserted in the angular apophyses of the os frontis, and to be blended a little with the muscles of the palpebrae and nose. The upper extremities of their fleshy fibres are fixed in the external or convex surface of the pericranium. Each of their lateral portions covers a portion of the temporal muscle on the same side, and adheres very closely to it.\n\nThe occipital muscles are two small, thin, broad, and very short fleshy planes, situated on the lateral parts of the occiput, at some distance from each other. They are inserted by the inferior extremities of their fleshy fibres in the superior transverse line of the os occipitis, and also a little above it. From thence they run up obliquely from behind forward, and are fixed in the inner concave surface of the pericranium.\n\nThe breadth of these muscles reaches from the posterior middle part of the occiput, toward the mastoid apophysis, and they diminish unequally in length as they approach the apophyses.\n\nThese four muscles seem always to act in concert, the occipitales being only auxiliaries or assistants to the frontales, the office of which is to raise the supercilia, by wrinkling the skin of the forehead.\n\nThe musculi superciliares are fleshy fasciculi, situated behind the supercilia, and behind the inferior portion of the musculi frontales, from the root of the nose to above one half of each superciliary arch. They are strongly-inserted, partly in the synarthroses of the os naso, with the os frontis, where they come very near the proper muscles of the nose, and partly in a small neighbouring portion of the orbit. From thence they first run up a little, and afterwards more or less in the direction of the eye-brows. They are made up of several small fasciculi of oblique fibres, all fixed by one end in the manner already said, and by the other partly in the lower extremity of the muscles by which they are covered, and partly in the skin of the supercilia.\n\nThe action of these muscles is to depress the eyebrows, to bring them close together, and to contract the skin of the fore-head immediately above the nose, into longitudinal and oblique wrinkles, and the skin which covers the root of the nose into irregular transverse wrinkles.\n\nThe Palpebrae and Membrana Conjunctiva.\n\nThe palpebrae are a kind of veils or curtains placed transversely above and below the anterior portion of the globe of the eye; and accordingly there are two eyelids to each eye, one superior, the other inferior. The superior is the largest and most moveable in man. They both unite at each side of the globe, and the places of their union are termed angles, one large and internal, which is next the nose, the other small or external, which is next the temples.\n\nThe palpebrae are made up of common and proper parts. The common parts are the skin, epidermis, and membrana adiposa. The proper parts are the muscles, the tarso, the puncta or foramina lacrymalia, the membrana conjunctiva, the glandula lacrymalis, and the particular ligaments which sustain the tarso. The tarso and their ligaments are in some measure the basis of all these parts.\n\nThe tarso are thin cartilages forming the principal part of the edge of each palpebra; and they are broader at the middle than at the extremities. Those of the superior palpebra are something less than half an inch in breadth; but in the lower palpebrae they are not above the sixth part of an inch; and their extremities next the temples are more slender than those next the nose.\n\nThese cartilages are suited to the borders and curvature of the eye-lids. The lower edge of the superior cartilage and upper edge of the inferior, terminate equally, and both may be termed the ciliary edges. The opposite edge of the upper tarso is something semi-circular between its two extremities; but that of the inferior tarso is more uniform, and both are thinner than the ciliary edges.\nThe broad ligaments of the tarso are membranous elongations formed by the union of the periosteum of the orbits and pericranium along both edges of each orbit. The superior ligament is broader than the inferior, and fixed to the superior edge of the upper cartilage; as the inferior is to the lower edge of the lower cartilage, so that these ligaments and the tarso, taken alone or without the other parts, represent palpebrae.\n\nThe membrana conjunctiva is a thin membrane, one portion of which lines the inner surface of the palpebrae. At the edge of the orbit it has a fold, and is continued from hence on the anterior half of the globe of the eye, adhering to the tunica albuginea; so that the palpebrae and the forepart of the globe of the eye are covered by one and the same membrane, which does not appear to be a continuation of the pericranium, but has some connection with the broad ligaments of the tarso.\n\nThe name of conjunctiva is commonly given only to that part which covers the globe, the other being called simply the internal membrane of the palpebrae; but we may very well name the one membrana oculi conjunctiva, and the other membrana palpebrarum conjunctiva. That of the palpebrae is a very fine membrane adhering very close, and full of small capillary blood-vessels. It is perforated by numerous imperceptible pores, through which a kind of serum is continually discharged.\n\nThe conjunctiva of the eye adheres by the intervention of a cellular substance, and is consequently loose, and as it were moveable; and it may be taken hold of and separated in several places from the tendinous coat. It is of a whitish colour; and being transparent, the albuginea makes it appear perfectly white: These two coats together forming what is called the white of the eye.\n\nThe lacrymal gland is white, and of the number of those called conglomerate glands. It lies under that depression observable in the arch of the orbit near the temples, and laterally above the globe of the eye. It is a little flattened, and divided as it were into two lobes, one of which lies toward the insertion of the musculus rectus superior, the other toward the rectus externus. It adheres very closely to the fat which surrounds the muscles and posterior convexity of the eye, and it was formerly named glandula innominata.\n\nFrom this gland several small ducts go out, which run down almost parallel to each other, through the substance of the tunica interna or conjunctiva of the superior palpebra, and afterwards pierce it inwardly near the superior edge of the tarso.\n\nThe flat edge of each palpebra is adorned with a row of hairs called cilia, or the eye-lashes. Those belonging to the superior palpebra are bent upward, and longer than those of the lower palpebra which are bent downward. These rows are placed next the skin, and are not single, but irregularly double or triple. The hairs are near the middle of the palpebra than toward the end for about a quarter of an inch from the outer angle they are quite wanting.\n\nAlong the inner border of the palpebrae, near the internal commissure, or toward the eye, we see a row of small holes which may be named foramina or puncta ciliaria. They are the orifices of the same number of small oblong glands which lie in the sulci, channels, or grooves on the inner surface of the tarso. These little glands are of a whitish colour; and when squeezed, a sebaceous matter like soft wax, is discharged through the puncta ciliaria.\n\nNear the great or internal angle of the palpebrae, the flat portion of their edges terminates in another which is rounder and thinner. By the union of these two edges an angle is formed.\n\nAt this place, the extremity of the flat portion is distinguished from the round portion by a small protuberance or papilla, which is obliquely perforated by a small hole in the edge of each palpebra. These two small holes are very visible, and often more so in living than in dead bodies, and they are commonly named puncta lachrymalia, being the orifices of two small ducts which open beyond the angle of the eye into a particular reservoir, termed facculus lachrymalis, which shall be described in the article of the nose.\n\nThe puncta lachrymalia are opposite to each other, and so they meet when the eye is shut. Round the orifice of each of these points, we observe a whitish circle which seems to be a cartilaginous appendix of the tarso, and which keeps the orifice always open.\n\nThe caruncula lachrymalis is a small reddish, granulated, oblong body, situated precisely between the internal angle of the palpebrae and globe of the eye. The substance of it seems to be wholly glandular. We discover upon it a great number of fine hairs covered by an oily, yellowish matter; and on the globe of the eye, near this glandular body, we see a semilunar fold, formed by the conjunctiva, the concave side of which is turned to the uvea, and the convex side to the nose.\n\nThe Muscles of the Palpebrae.\n\nThe muscles of the palpebrae are commonly reckoned to be two, one peculiar to the upper eye-lid, named levator palpebrae superioris; the other common to both, called musculus orbicularis palpebrarum.\n\nThe levator palpebrae superioris is a very thin muscle, situated in the orbit above, and along the rectus superior oculi. It is fixed to the bottom of the orbit, by a small narrow tendon, near the foramen opticum, between the posterior insertions of the rectus superior and obliquus superior. From thence its fleshy fibres run forward on the rectus, increasing gradually in breadth, and terminate by a very broad aponeurosis in the tarso of the superior palpebra.\n\nBy the musculus palpebrarum obliquus we understand all that extent of fleshy fibres, which by a thin stratum surrounds the edge of each orbit, and from thence, without any interruption, covers the two palpebrae all the way to the cilia. Almost all of them have a common tendon situated transversely between the internal angle of the eye and the nasal apophysis of the os maxillare. This is a slender ligamentary tendon, strongest where it is fixed in the bone, and diminishing gradually as it approaches the angle of the palpebrae, where it terminates at\nat the union of the points, or at the extremities of the two raphs.\n\nThis muscle is divided into four portions, whereof the first is that which surrounds the orbit. The second portion is that which lies between the upper edge of the orbit and the globe of the eye, and which covers the inferior edge of the orbit below, some of its fibres being fixed to both edges of the orbit.\n\nThe third portion seems to belong more particularly to the palpebrae, and the greatest part of it is spent in the palpebra superior. The fibres of this portion meet at the two angles of the eye, where they appear to make very acute inflections without any discontinuation.\n\nThe fourth portion is an appendix to the third, from which it differs chiefly in this, that its fibres do not reach to the angles, and form only small arches, the extremities of which terminate in each palpebra.\n\nAll these different portions of the orbicular muscle adhere to the skin, which covers it from the upper part of the nose to the temples, and from the supercilium to the upper part of the cheek. When they contract, several wrinkles are formed in the skin, which vary according to the different directions of the fibres.\n\nThe Uses of the Eye, and of its Appendages, in general.\n\nEvery body knows that the eye is the organ of vision. The transparent parts of the globe modify the rays of light, by different refractions; the retina and choroides receive the different impressions of these rays; and the optic nerve carries these impressions to the brain. When objects are at a great distance or obscure, the pupilla is dilated; and it is contracted when objects are near, or placed in a great light. The muscles of the globe of the eye and of the palpebrae perform the motions already described.\n\nThe glandula lachrymalis continually moistens the fore-part of the globe of the eye; and the lachrymal serum is equally spread over that globe by the motions of the superior palpebra, the inner surface of which is in a small measure villous. The union of the two palpebra directs this serum towards the puncta lachrymalia; and the unctuous matter, discharged through the foramina ciliaria, hinders it from running out between the palpebrae. The large size and viscid surface of the caruncula prevents it from running beyond the puncta, and thus forces it into them.\n\nThe supercilia may hinder sweat from falling on the eyes. The superior cilia, which are longer than the inferior, may have the same use; and they both serve to prevent dust, insects, &c., from entering the eyes when they are only a little open.\n\nSect. VI. The Nose.\n\nThe bones of the nose have already been described in the futures of the bones of the head.\n\nThe soft parts are the integuments, muscles, facculus lachrymalis, membrana pituitaria, and hairs of the nares.\n\nThe internal nares, or the two cavities of the nose, comprehend the whole space between the external nares and posterior openings immediately above the arch of the palate; from whence these cavities reach upward as far as the lamina cribrosa of the os ethmoides, where they communicate forward with the sinus frontales, and backward with the sinus sphenoidales. Laterally, these cavities are bounded on the inside by the septum narium, and on the outside, or that next the cheeks, by the conchae, between which they communicate with the sinus maxillaris.\n\nThe particular situation of these cavities deserves our attention. The bottom of them runs directly backward, so that a straight and pretty large filet may easily be passed from the external nares, under the great apophysis of the occipital bone. The openings of the maxillary sinuses are nearly opposite to the upper edge of the osseum maxillare. The openings of the frontal sinuses are more or less opposite to, and between the pterygoid rings of the musculi trocheares; and by these marks the situation of all the other parts may be determined.\n\nThe inferior portion of the external nose is composed of several cartilages, which are commonly five in number, and of a pretty regular figure. The rest are only additional, smaller, more irregular, and the number of them more uncertain. Of the five ordinary cartilages, one is situated in the middle, the other four laterally. The middle cartilage is the most considerable, and supports the rest, being connected immediately to the bony parts; but the other four are connected to the middle cartilage, and to each other, by means of ligaments.\n\nThe sub-septum, or portion under the septum narium, is a pillar of fat applied to the inferior edge of the cartilaginous partition, in form of a soft moveable appendix. The thickness of the alae narium, and especially that of their lower edges, is not owing to the cartilages, which are very thin, but to the same kind of solid fat with which these cartilages are covered. The great cartilage is immovable by reason of its firm connection to the bony parts of the nose; but the lateral cartilages are moveable, because of their ligamentary connections, and they are moved in different manners by the muscles belonging to them.\n\nThe external nose is covered by the common integuments, the skin, epidermis, and fat. Those which cover the tip of the nose and alae narium are a great number of glandular bodies, called glandulae sebacea, the contents of which may easily be squeezed out by the fingers.\n\nSix muscles are commonly reckoned to belong to the nose; two recti, called also pyramidales or triangulares; two obliqui, or laterales; and two transversi, or myrtiformes. The nose may also be moved in some measure by the muscles of the lips, which in many cases become assistants to the proper muscles of this organ.\n\nThe musculus pyramidalis, or anterior, on each side, is inserted by one extremity in the fynarthrosis of the os frontis and osse nasa, where its fleshy fibres mix with those of the musculi frontales and superciliares. It is very flat, and runs down on the side of the nose, increasing gradually in breadth, and terminating by an aponeurosis, which represents the basis of a pyramid, and is inser-\nIt is proper here to observe the whole extent of the maxillary sinus. Below, there is but a very thin partition between it and the dentes molares, the roots of which do, in some subjects, perforate that septum. Above, there is only a very thin transparent lamina between the orbit and the sinus. Backward, above the tuberosity of the os maxillare, the sides of the sinus are very thin, especially at the place which lies before the root of the apophysis pterygoidei, through which the inferior maxillary nerve sends down a ramus to the foramen palatinum posterius, commonly called gustatorium. Inward, or toward the concha narium, the bony part of the sinus is likewise very thin.\n\nThe lachrymal f\u00e6culus is an oblong membranous bag, into which the serous fluid is discharged from the eye through the puncta lachrymalia; and from which the same fluid passes to the lower part of the internal nares. It is situated in a bony groove and canal, formed partly by the apophysis nasalis of the os maxillare and os unguis, partly by the same os maxillare and lower part of the os unguis, and partly by this lower portion of the os unguis and a small superior portion of the concha narium inferior.\n\nThis bony lachrymal duct runs down for a little way obliquely backward, toward the lower and lateral part of the internal nares on each side, where its lower extremity opens on one side of the sinus maxillaris under the inferior concha. The upper part of this duct is only an half canal or groove; the lower is a complete canal, narrower than the former.\n\nThe f\u00e6culus lachrymalis may be divided into a superior or orbital portion, and an inferior or nasal portion. The orbital portion fills the whole bony groove, being situated immediately behind the middle tendon of the musculus orbicularis. The nasal portion lies in the bony canal of the nose, being narrower and shorter than the former.\n\nThe orbital portion is disposed at its upper extremity, much in the manner of an intestine sac, and at the lower extremity is continued with the portio nasalis. Towards the internal angle of the eye, behind the tendon of the orbicular muscle, it is perforated by a small short canal formed by the union of the lachrymal ducts.\n\nThe nasal portion having reached the lower part of the bony duct under the inferior concha, terminates in a small, flat, membranous bag, the bottom of which is perforated by a round opening.\n\nThe substance of this f\u00e6culus is something spongy or cellular, and pretty thick, being strongly united by its convex side to the periosteum of the bony canal.\n\nThe ductus incisiori, or naso-palatini of Steno, are two canals which go from the bottom of the internal nares across the arch of the palate, and open behind the first or largest dentes incisorii. Their two orifices may be distinctly seen in the skeleton at the lower part of the nasal fossa, on the anterior and lateral sides of the cribrum maxillare; and we may likewise perceive their oblique passage through the maxillary bones, and lastly their inferior orifices in a small cavity or fossula, called foramen palatinum anterius.\nThe nose is the organ of smelling, by means of the villous portion of the internal membrane, to which the olfactory nerves are chiefly distributed. It is likewise of use in respiration; and the mucilaginous fluid spread over the whole pituitary membrane, prevents the air from drying that membrane, and so rendering it incapable of being affected. The nose serves likewise to regulate and modify the voice, and to this the sinuses likewise contribute. The sacculus lachrymalis receives the serum from the eyes, and discharges it upon the palate, from whence the greatest part of it runs to the pharynx.\n\n**Sect. VII. The Ear.**\n\nAnatomists commonly divide or distinguish the ear into external and internal. By the external ear they mean all that lies without the external orifice of the meatus auditorius in the os temporis; and by the internal ear, all that lies within the cavities of that bone, and also the parts that bear any relation thereto.\n\nThe greatest part of the external ear consists of a large cartilage very artificially framed, which is the basis of all the other parts of which this portion of the ear is made up. The internal ear consists chiefly of several bony pieces, partly formed in the substance of the os temporum, and especially in that portion of it called apophysis petrosa, and partly separated from, but contained in a particular cavity of that bone.\n\nThe external ear, taken altogether, resembles in some degree the shell of a mussel, with its broad end turned upward, the small end downward, the convex side next the head, and the concave side outward. Two portions are distinguished in the external ear taken all together; one large and solid, called in Latin pinna, which is the superior, and by much the greatest part; the other small and soft, called the lobe, which makes the lower part.\n\nThe foreside is divided into eminences and cavities. The eminences are four in number, called helix, anthelix, tragus, and antitragus. The helix is the large folded border or circumference of the great portion of the ear. The anthelix is the large oblong eminence or rising surrounded by the helix. The tragus is the small anterior protuberance below the anterior extremity of the helix, which in an advanced age is covered with hairs. The antitragus is the posterior tubercle below the inferior extremity of the anthelix.\n\nThe cavities on the foreside are four in number; the hollow of the helix; the depression at the superior extremity of the anthelix, called fossa navicularis; the concha, or great double cavity that lies under the rising termed anthelix, the upper bottom of which is distinguished from the lower by a continuation of the helix in form of a transverse cleft; and lastly, the meatus of the external ear situated at the lower part of the bottom of the concha.\n\nThe backside of the external ear shews only one considerable eminence, which is a portion of the convex side of the concha, the other portion being hid by the addition of the ear to the os temporis.\n\nThe other parts of the external ear, besides the cartilage, are ligaments, muscles, integuments, sebaceous and ceruminous glands, arteries, veins and nerves.\n\nThe cartilage of the outward ear is nearly of the same extent and figure with the large solid portion thereof, already mentioned; but it is not of the same thickness, being covered by integuments on both sides. In the lobe or soft lower portion of the ear, this cartilage is wanting.\n\nThe external ear is fixed to the cranium, not only by the cartilaginous portion of the meatus auditorius, but also by ligaments, which are two in number, one anterior, the other posterior. The anterior ligament is fixed by one extremity to the root of the apophysis zygomatica of the os temporis, at the anterior and a little toward the superior part of the meatus ossis, close to the corner of the glenoid cavity; and by the other extremity, to the anterior and superior part of the cartilaginous meatus.\n\nThe posterior ligament is fixed by one end to the root of the mastoid apophysis, and by the other to the posterior part of the convexity of the concha, so that it is opposite to the anterior ligament.\n\nOf the muscles of the external ear, some go between the cartilages and the os temporis, others are confined to the cartilages alone. Both kinds vary in different subjects, and are sometimes so very thin, as to look more like ligaments than muscles. The muscles of the first kind are generally three in number, one superior, one posterior, and one anterior. The superior muscle is fixed in the convexity of the fossa navicularis, and of the superior portion of the concha; from whence it runs up to the squamous portion of the os temporis, expanding in a radiated manner, and is inserted principally in the ligamentary aponeurosis, which covers the posterior portion of the temporal muscle.\n\nThe anterior muscle is small, more or less inserted, and like an appendix to the superior. It is fixed by one extremity above the root of the zygomatic apophysis, and by the other in the anterior part of the convexity of the concha.\n\nThe posterior muscle is almost transverse, and of a considerable breadth, being fixed by one end to the posterior part of the convexity of the concha, and by the other in the root of the mastoid apophysis.\n\nThe small muscles which are confined to the cartilages are only small strata of fibres found on both sides of the cartilages.\n\nThe lobe of the ear, or that soft portion which lies under the tragus, antitragus, and meatus auditorius, is made up of nothing but skin and cellular substance. The meatus auditorius is partly bony, and partly cartilaginous. The bony portion is the longest, and forms the bottom of the canal. The cartilaginous portion is the shortest, and forms the external opening or orifice of the canal.\n\nThese two portions joined endwise to each other, form a canal of about three quarters of an inch in length, of different wideness in its different parts, and a little contorted. It is lined on the inside by the skin and cellular membrane, through its whole length; and thus these integuments make up for the breaks in the cartilaginous portion.\nportion, and form a kind of cutaneous tube in the other portion.\n\nThe skin which covers both sides of the cartilage contains a great number of small glands, which continually discharge an oily whitish humour, collected chiefly near the adhesions of the ear to the head, and under the fold of the helix; and these glands are of the sebaceous kind. The skin which lines the meatus auditorius contains another kind of glands, of a yellowish colour, and which may be plainly seen on the convex side of the cutaneous tube already mentioned.\n\nThese glands are disposed in such a manner as to leave reticular spaces between them, and they penetrate a little way into the substance of the skin. They are called glandula ceruminosa, because they discharge that matter which is named cerumen, or the wax of the ear. The inner surface of the cutaneous tube is full of fine hairs, between which lie the orifices of the ceruminous glands. The first place in which we meet with these glands is on that part of the convex side of the cutaneous tube which supplies the breaks of the cartilaginous meatus.\n\nAll the bony parts of the organ of hearing, or bones of the internal ear, being contained in the inferior portions of the osseum temporum; it will be very proper to recollect what has been already said about these, in Part I.\n\nAll the bony organ of hearing may be divided into four general parts: 1. The external meatus auditorius; 2. The tympanum or barrel of the ear; 3. The labyrinth; 4. The internal meatus auditorius. It likewise be divided into immovable or containing parts, which take in all the four already mentioned; and moveable or contained parts, which are four little bones lodged in the tympanum, called incus, malleus, stapes, and os orbiculare or lenticulare.\n\nThe external auditory passage begins by the external auditory hole, the edge of which is rough and prominent; but backwards towards the mastoid apophysis it appears very much sloped. The passage itself is about half an inch in length, running obliquely from behind forward, in a curve direction, and sometimes winding a little in the middle, like a screw. Its cavity is almost oval, wider at the entry than at the middle, after which it widens again by degrees.\n\nIt terminates inwardly by an even circular edge lying in a plane very much inclined; the upper part of it being turned outward, and the lower part inward; so that the whole canal is longer on the lower side than on the upper. The concave side of the circular edge is grooved quite round.\n\nIn children this bony canal is wanting, as well as the mastoid apophysis; and the inner circular edge is a distinct ring, which in an advanced age unites entirely, and becomes one piece with the rest. It is termed the bony circle in infants, and indeed it is very easily separated from all the other parts.\n\nIt would seem therefore, that the whole bony canal in adults is only a prolongation of the bony circle in children; because even in a more advanced age, the whole canal may, without much difficulty, be taken out. The circular groove lies between the mastoid apophysis and the articular fissure or crack.\n\nThe tympanum or barrel of the ear is a cavity irregularly semi-spherical, the bottom of it being turned inward, and the mouth joined to the circular groove already mentioned. Both eminences and cavities are observable in it.\n\nThe remarkable eminences are three in number; a large tuberosity lying in the very bottom of the barrel, a little toward the back part; and a small irregular pyramid situated above the tuberosity, and a little more backward; the apex of it is perforated by a small hole, and on one side of the basis two small bony filaments are often found in a parallel situation. In the third eminence is a cavity shaped like the mouth of a spoon, situated at the upper and a little towards the anterior part of the bottom of the tympanum.\n\nThe principal cavities in the tympanum are, the opening of the mastoid cells or sinuities; the opening of the Eustachian tube; the bony half-canal; the fenestra ovalis and rotunda; and to these may be added the small hole in the pyramid.\n\nThe opening in the mastoid cells is at the posterior and upper part of the edge of the barrel. The cells themselves which end there are dug in the substance of the mastoid process, being very irregular and full of windings and turnings.\n\nThe opening of the Eustachian tube is at the anterior and a little toward the upper part of the edge of the barrel. This tube runs from the tympanum, towards the posterior openings of the nasal fossa, and arch of the palate. The bony portion thereof is dug in the apophysis petrosa, along the duct of the carotid apophysis; and when it leaves that, it is lengthened out by the spinal apophysis of the os sphenoides.\n\nThe bony half-canal, of which the cavity resembling the mouth of a spoon is the extremity, lies immediately above the Eustachian tube, towards the upper side of the apophysis petrosa, or rather in the very substance of that upper side.\n\nThe fenestra ovalis is a hole of communication between the tympanum and labyrinth. It lies immediately above the tuberosity, the upper side of it being a little rounded, the lower a little flattened; and one extremity being turned forward, the other backward.\n\nThe fenestra rotunda is something less than the ovalis, and situated in the lower, and a little towards the posterior part of the large tuberosity; the opening of it, which is the orifice of a particular duct in the labyrinth, lying obliquely backward and outward.\n\nThe hole in the apex of the pyramid is the orifice of a cavity, which may be named the sinus of this pyramid.\n\nThe tympanum contains several little bones called the bones of the ear. They are generally four in number, denominated from something to which they are thought to bear a resemblance, viz. incus, malleus, stapes, and os orbiculare or lenticulare.\n\nThe incus, or anvil, resembles, in some measure, one of the anterior grinders with its roots at a great distance from each other; at least it comes nearer to this than to the shape of the anvil. It may be divided into a body and branches. The body is a large substance, the branches\nbranches or legs are two, one long and one short. The body is turned forward, the short leg backward, and the long leg downward.\n\nThe body of the incus is broader than it is thick. It has two eminences, and two cavities between them, much in the same manner as we see in the crown of the first grinders.\n\nThe short leg is thick at its origin, and from thence decreasing gradually, it ends in a point. It is situated horizontally, its point being turned backward, and joined to the edge of the mastoid opening of the tympanum.\n\nThe long leg, viewed through the external auditory passage, appears to be situated vertically; but if we look upon it either on the fore or backside, we see it is inclined, the extremity of it being turned much more inward, than the root or origin. The point of the extremity is a little flattened, and bent inward like a hook, and sometimes a little hollowed like a kind of ear-pick.\n\nThe malleus or hammer is a long bone, with a large head, a small neck, an handle, and two apophyses, one in the neck, the other in the handle.\n\nThe top of the head is considerably rounded, and from thence it contracts all the way to the neck. Both head and neck are in an inclined situation, and the eminences and cavities in it answer to those in the body of the incus.\n\nThe handle is looked upon by some as one of the apophyses of the malleus; and in that case, it is the greatest of the three. It forms an angle with the neck and head, near which it is something broad and flat, and decreases gradually toward its extremity.\n\nThe apophysis of the handle, termed by others the small or short apophysis of the malleus, terminates the angle already mentioned, being extended towards the neck, and lying in a straight line with that side or border of the handle which is next it.\n\nThe apophysis of the neck, called also apophysis gracilis, is in a natural state very long, but so slender without, that it is very easily broken, especially when dry; it arises from the neck, and sometimes appears much longer than it really is, by the addition of a small dried tendon sticking to it.\n\nThe stapes is a small bone, very well denominated from the resemblance it bears to a stirrup. It is divided into the head, legs, and basis.\n\nThe head is placed upon a short flattened neck, the top of it being sometimes flat, sometimes a little hollow.\n\nThe two legs taken together, form an arch, like that of a stirrup, in the concave side of which is a groove, which runs through their whole length. One leg is longer, more bent, and a little broader than the other.\n\nThe basis resembles that of a stirrup, both in its oval shape, and union with the legs, except that it is not perforated as the stirrups now are, but solid, like those of the ancients. Round its circumference, next the legs, is a little border, which makes that side of the basis appear a little hollow. The other side is pretty smooth, and one half of the circumference is something more curve than the other.\n\nThe orbicular or lenticular bone is the smallest bone in the body. It lies between the head of the stapes and extremity of the long leg of the incus, being articulated with each of these. In dry bones it is found very closely connected, sometimes to the stapes, sometimes to the incus, and might in that state be easily mistaken for an epiphysis of either of these bones.\n\nThe labyrinth is divided into three parts, the anterior, middle, and posterior. The middle portion is termed vestibulum; the anterior, cochlea; and the posterior, the labyrinth in particular, which comprehends the three semicircular canals.\n\nThe vestibulum is an irregularly round cavity, less than the tympanum, and situated more inward and a little more forward. These two cavities are, in a manner, set back to back, with a common partition-wall between them, perforated near the middle by the fenestra ovalis, by which the cavities communicate with one another.\n\nThe cavity of the vestibulum is likewise perforated by several other holes; on the outside, or towards the tympanum, by the fenestra rotunda; on the backside, by the five orifices of the semicircular canals; on the lower part of the foreside, by two holes, which are the entry of the cochlea; and on the foreside, towards the internal meatus auditorius, opposite to the fenestra ovalis, by a great many very small holes for the passage of the nerves.\n\nThe semicircular canals are three in number, one vertical and superior, one vertical and posterior, and one horizontal. The superior vertical canal is situated transversely with respect to the apophysis petrosa, the convex side or curvature of it being turned upward, and the extremities downward, one inward, the other outward. The posterior vertical canal lies parallel to the length of the apophysis, the curvature being turned backward, and the extremities forward, one upward, the other downward; and the superior extremity of this canal meets and loses itself in the internal extremity of the former. The curvature and extremities of the horizontal canal are almost on a level; the curvature lying obliquely backward, and the extremities forward, ending under those of the superior vertical canal, but a little nearer each other; and the inner being almost in the middle space, between the extremities of the posterior vertical canal.\n\nThe horizontal canal is generally the least of the three; the posterior vertical is often, and the superior vertical sometimes, the greatest; all the three canals are larger than a semicircle, forming nearly three quadrants; they are broader at the orifices than in the middle. These orifices open into the back-side of the vestibulum, being but five in number, so that in the posterior part of the vestibulum, two appear towards the inside, and three towards the outside.\n\nThe cochlea is a sort of spiral shell, with two ducts, formed in the anterior part of the apophysis petrosa, in some measure resembling the shell of a snail. The parts to be distinguished in it, are the basis, the apex, the spiral lamina, or half septum, by which its cavity is divided into two half-canals; the spindle round which the cochlea turns; and lastly, the orifices and union of the two ducts.\n\nThe basis is turned directly inward, toward the internal foramen auditorium, the apex outward, and the axis of the spindle is nearly horizontal.\nThe basis of the cochlea is gently hollowed, and towards the middle perforated by several small holes. The spindle is a kind of short cone, with a very large basis, which is the middle of the basis of the cochlea. Thro' its whole length runs a double spiral groove, which, through a microscope, shews a great number of pores.\n\nThe cochlea makes about two turns and an half from the basis to the apex; and the two ducts, being strictly united together through their whole course, form an entire common septum, which must not be confounded with the half septum or spiral lamina, as is often done. The first might be termed the common septum, the other the particular septum or half-septum.\n\nBoth of them are closely joined to the spindle, being thicker there than in any other place. The common septum is complete, and separates the turns entirely from each other; whereas the half-septum in the skeleton is only a spiral lamina, the breadth of which is terminated all round by a very thin border lying in the middle cavity of the cochlea. In the natural state, there is a membranous half-septum, which completes the partition between the two ducts.\n\nThe two half-canals turn jointly about the spindle, one being situated towards the basis of the cochlea, the other towards the apex: for which reason they have been termed the one internal, and the other external; the division of them into the upper and lower flight, not being agreeable to the natural state, but liable to convey a very false idea thereof.\n\nThe spiral or volute of the cochlea, begins at the lower part of the vestibulum, runs from thence forward to the top, then backward down to the bottom, afterwards upwards and forwards, and so on from the basis which is turned inward, to the apex which is turned outward.\n\nThe two half-canals communicate fully at the apex of the cochlea. Their separate openings are towards the basis, one of them being immediately into the lower part of the foreside of the vestibulum, the other into the fenestra rotunda.\n\nThe internal auditory hole is in the backside of the apophysis petrosa, in some measure behind the vestibulum and basis of the cochlea. It is a kind of blind hole, divided into two fossulae, one large, the other small. The large one lies lowest, and serves for the portio molis of the auditory nerve or seventh pair. The small one is uppermost, and is the opening of a small duct through which the portio dura of the same nerve passes.\n\nThe inferior fossula is full of little holes, which, in the natural state, are filled with nervous filaments of the portio mollis, which go to the spindle, to the semicircular canals, and to those of the cochlea. It is this fossula which forms the shallow cavity at the basis of the spindle of the cochlea.\n\nThe passage for the portio dura of the auditory nerve runs behind the tympanum, and its orifice is the stylo-masto\u00efd hole. It begins by the small fossula, and pierces from within, outwards, the upper part of the apophysis petrosa, making there an angle or curvature. From thence it is inclined backward, behind the small pyramid of the tympanum, and runs down to the stylo-masto\u00efd hole. It communicates likewise, by a small hole, with the sinus of the pyramid; and lower down, by another hole, with the barrel of the ear.\n\nThe internal parts of the ear are chiefly the membrana tympani, the periosteum of the barrel, os\u00edculos auditis, labyrinth and all its cavities, the membrana masto\u00efdea interna, the muscles of the os\u00edculos, and the parts which complete the formation of the Eustachian tube.\n\nThe Eustachian tube is a canal or duct which goes from the tympanum to the posterior openings of the nares, or nasal fossa, and toward the arch of the palate.\n\nThe bony portion of it lies through its whole length immediately above the fissure of the glenoid or articular cavity of the os temporis, and terminates at the meeting of the spinal apophysis of the os sphenoidale with the apophysis petrosa of the os temporis.\n\nThe other or mixed portion reaches in the same direction from this place to the internal ala of the apophysis pterygo\u00efdes, or to the posterior and outer edge of the nares. It is properly divided into four parts, two superior, and two inferior.\n\nThe two upper parts or quarters are bony; and of these the innermost is formed by the side of the apophysis petrosa, the outermost by the side of the apophysis spinalis of the os sphenoides, so that the upper half of this portion of the tube is bony. Of the two inferior parts, the internal is cartilaginous, and the external membranous; so that the lower half of this portion of the tube is partly cartilaginous next the os sphenoidale, and partly membranous next the apophysis petrosa.\n\nThe Eustachian tube thus formed, is very narrow in the bony part next the ear. The other portion grows gradually wider, especially near the posterior nares, where the inner cartilaginous side terminates by a prominent edge, and the outer side joins that of the neighbouring nostril. The cavity of the tube is lined by a membrane like that of the internal nares, of which it appears to be a continuation.\n\nThe situation of the two tubes is oblique, their posterior extremities at the ears being at a greater distance than the anterior at the nares, and the convex sides of the prominent edges are turned toward each other. The openings of the tubes are oval at this place, as is likewise their whole cavity, especially that of the mixed portion.\n\nThe membrana tympani is a thin, transparent, flatish pellicle, the edge of which is round, and strongly fixed in the orbicular groove which divides the bony meatus of the external ear from the tympanum or barrel. This membrane is very much stretched or very tense, and yet not perfectly flat: for on the side next the meatus externus it has a small hollowness, which is pointed in the middle; and on the side next the tympanum it is gently convex, and also pointed in the middle.\n\nThis membrane is situated obliquely, the upper part of its circumference being turned outward, and the lower part inward, suitably to the direction of the bony groove already mentioned. It is made up of several very fine laminae, closely united together. The external lamina is in some measure a production of the skin and cuticle of the external meatus; the internal lamina is a continuation of the periosteum of the tympanum; and when the membrane has been first macerated in water, each...\neach of these laminae may be subdivided into several others.\n\nThe depression in the middle of the membrana tympani is caused by the adhesion of the little bone called malleus, the handle of which is closely joined to the inside of the membrane from the upper part of the circumference all the way to the center to which the end of the handle is fixed. This handle seems to lie in a very fine membranous duplicature, by means of which it is tied to the membrana tympani, and which serves it for a periosteum.\n\nThe periosteum of the tympanum or barrel of the ear produces that of the small bones; it is likewise continued over the two fenestra, and enters the eustachian tube, where it is lost in the inner membrane of that duct.\n\nThe cells of the mastoid cavity are very irregular cavities in the substance of the mastoid apophysis, which communicate with each other, and have a common opening towards the inside, and a little above the posterior edge of the orbicular groove. These cells are lined by a fine membrane, which is partly a continuation of the periosteum of the tympanum, and partly seems to be of a glandular structure like a kind of the membrana pituitaria. The mastoid opening is opposite to the small opening of the Eustachian tube, but a little higher.\n\nThe ligaments of the osseous come next in order. The incus is tied by a strong short ligament, fixed in the point of the short leg, to the edge of the mastoid opening. Between the incus and malleus we find a small, thin cartilage. The malleus is connected through the whole length of its handle to the inside of the membrana tympani.\n\nThe malleus has three muscles, one external, one anterior, and one internal; and the stapes has one muscle. The external or superior muscle of the malleus, is a thin fasciculus of fleshy fibres lying along the upper part of the bony meatus auditorius, between the periosteum and the other integuments. The outer part of it is pretty broad, and it contracts by degrees as it advances towards the upper part or break of the orbicular groove of the tympanum, into which it enters by a small tendon, above the membrana tympani, and is inserted in the neck of the malleus, near the small eminence or short apophysis of the handle.\n\nThe anterior muscle of the malleus, is fleshy, long, and thin. It runs along the outside of the Eustachian tube, to which it adheres very closely through its whole length. Its anterior extremity is fixed in that side of the tube just before the sphenoidal spine; and the posterior extremity ends in a long thin tendon, which runs in the articular or glenoid fissure of the os temporis, through a small oblique notch; in which fissure it enters the tympanum, and is inserted in the long thin apophysis of the malleus. It is partly accompanied by a nerve, which forms what is called the chorda tympani.\n\nThe internal muscle of the malleus is very fleshy and distinct. It lies along the inside of the Eustachian tube, partly on the cartilaginous, and partly on the bony portion, being fixed by one extremity in the apophysis petrosa. Afterwards it runs along the cavity of the bony half-canal of the tympanum, within which cavity it is invested by a portion of a membranous or ligamentary vagina, which being fixed to the edges of the half-canal, forms an infire tube therewith.\n\nAt the extremity of this bony half-canal, where we observe the cavity shaped like the mouth of a spoon, this muscle ends in a tendon, which is bent round the transverse bony or ligamentary ridge in the last-named cavity, as over a pulley, and is inserted in the neck of the malleus above the small apophysis, advancing likewise as far as the handle.\n\nThe muscle of the stapes is short and thick, and lies concealed within the small bony pyramid at the bottom of the tympanum. The cavity which it fills, touches very nearly the bony canal of the portio dura of the auditory nerve; and it terminates in a small tendon which goes out of the cavity through the small hole in the apex of the pyramid. As it goes through the hole it turns forward, and is inserted in the neck of the stapes on the side of the longest and most crooked leg of that bone.\n\nThe three parts of the labyrinth, that is, the vestibulum, semicircular canals, and cochlea, are lined by a fine periosteum, which is continued over all the sides of their cavities, and shuts the two fenestrae of the tympanum.\n\nThe periosteum of the two sides of the bony spiral lamina advances beyond the edge of that lamina, and forms a membranous duplicature, which extending to the opposite side compleats the spiral septum.\n\nThis septum separates the two half-canals from the basis to the apex; but there it leaves a small opening, by which the small extremities of the half-canals communicate with each other. The large extremity of the external half-canal ends by an oblique turn in the fenestra rotonda, which is shut by a continuation of the periosteum of that canal. The large extremity of the other half-canal opens into the vestibulum; and these two extremities are entirely separated by a continuation of the periosteum.\n\nThe ear is the organ of which we can most distinctly unfold the structure, and demonstrate the greatest number of parts, that is, of small machines of which it is made up. We know likewise in general, that it is the organ of hearing; but when we endeavour to discover the uses of each of these parts, that is, how each contributes to the great design of the whole, after having thoroughly examined them, we must be obliged to own, that the greatest part of what the most able philosophers have said upon this subject, is without any real foundation.\n\nSect. VIII. The Mouth.\n\nThe mouth may be distinguished into external and internal, and the parts of which it consists may likewise come under the same two general heads.\n\nThe parts of the neck still undescribed are only the larynx, pharynx, glandula thyroidea, and the musculus cutaneus, which really belong to the head; and therefore, instead of making a particular section for so small a number of parts, especially since the larynx and pharynx have so near a relation to the internal parts of the mouth, we are under a necessity of describing them, before proceeding to the mouth in particular.\nThe larynx forms the protuberance in the upper and anterior part of the neck, called commonly *pomum Adam*.\n\nIt is chiefly made up of five cartilages, viz., Cartilago thyroidea, which is the anterior and largest; cricoides, the inferior, and basis of the reft; two arytenoidea, the posterior and smallest; and the epiglottis, which is above all the reft. These cartilages are connected together by ligaments, and they have likewise muscles, glands, membranes, &c., belonging to them.\n\nThe cartilago thyroidea is large and broad, and folded in such a manner as to have a longitudinal convexity on the foreside, and two lateral portions, which may be termed alae. The upper part of its anterior middle portion is formed into an angular notch; the upper edge of each ala makes an arch; and, together with the middle notch, these two edges resemble the upper part of an ace of hearts.\n\nThe lower edge of each ala is more even, and the posterior edges of both are very smooth, being lengthened out both above and below by apophyses, which are named the cornua of the thyroid cartilage.\n\nThe cricoid cartilage resembles a thick, irregular ring, very broad on one side, and narrow on the other; or it may be compared to a small portion of a thick tube, cut horizontally at one end, and very obliquely at the other. It is distinguished into a basis and top, into an anterior, posterior, and two lateral sides. The basis is almost horizontal, when we stand; and to this the aspera arteria is connected; so that the cricoides may be looked upon as the upper extremity of the trachea.\n\nThe posterior portion of the cricoides is larger than the reft, and its posterior or convex side is divided by a longitudinal eminence or prominent line into distinct surfaces, for the insertion of muscles. The top is gently sloped above this prominent line, and terminates on each side by a kind of obtuse angle, formed between it and the oblique edge of each lateral portion of this cartilage.\n\nThe whole posterior side is distinguished into two lateral portions by two prominent lines, each of which runs down almost in a straight direction from the articular surface at the top, a little below the middle of this side, where it terminates in another articular line a little concave; and near these four articular surfaces there are small tubercles. The two superior surfaces are for the articulation of the cartilagines arytenoidea; and the two inferior, for the articulation of the inferior cornua or appendices of the cartilago thyroidea.\n\nThe cartilagines arytenoidea are two small, equal, similar cartilages, which, joined together, resemble the spout of an ewer, and they are situated on the top of the cricoides. In each, we may consider the basis; cornua; two sides, one posterior and concave, the other anterior and convex; and two edges, one internal, the other external, which is very oblique. The bases are broad and thick, and have each a concave articular surface, by which they are joined to the cricoides.\n\nThe cornua are bent backward, and a little toward each other.\n\nThe epiglottis is an elastic cartilage, nearly of the figure of a purplish leaf, narrow and thick at the lower part, thin and slightly rounded at the upper part, gently convex on the foreside, and concave on the backside. It is situated above the anterior or convex portion of the cartilago thyroidea; and its lower extremity is tied by a short, pretty broad, and very strong ligament, to the middle notch in the upper edge of that cartilage. It is perforated by a great number of holes, something like those in the leaves of the hypericum, or St John's Wort, which are hid by the membranes that cover its two sides.\n\nThe cartilago thyroidea is connected to the cricoides by several short strong ligaments, round the articulations of the two inferior cornua, with the lateral articular surfaces of the cricoides. The apices of the superior cornua are fixed to the posterior extremities of the great cornua of the os hyoidei, by slender, round ligaments, about a quarter of an inch in length.\n\nThe thyroidea is likewise connected to the os hyoidei by a short, broad, strong ligament, one end of which is inserted in the superior notch of the cartilage, and the other in the lower edge of the basis of the bone. It has also two ligaments at the middle of the concave side, which belong to the arytenoidea.\n\nThe cricoides is tied to the lower part of the thyroidea by a strong ligament; and by the ligaments already mentioned, to the inferior cornua of that cartilage. Its basis is fixed to the first cartilaginous ring of the trachea arteria, by a ligament exactly like those by which the other rings are connected together; and the membranous or posterior portion of the trachea is likewise fixed to the posterior part of the basis of the cricoides.\n\nThe cartilagines arytenoidea are connected to the cricoides by ligaments, which surround their articulations with the top of that cartilage. Anteriorly the basis of each arytenoidea is fixed to one end of a ligamentary cord, which by its other end is inserted about the middle of the concave side of the anterior portion of the thyroidea. At their insertions in the thyroidea, these two ligaments touch each other, but a small space is left between them, where they are fixed in the two arytenoidea, and they seem likewise to have a small adhesion to the top of the cricoides. This is what is called the glottis.\n\nUnder these two ligamentary cords there are two others, which run likewise from behind forward. The interstice between the superior and inferior cords on each side form a transverse fissure, which is the opening of a small membranous bag, the bottom of which is turned outward, that is, toward the ala of the thyroidea. These two sacculi are chiefly formed by a continuation of the internal membrane of the larynx, and the inner surface of their bottom appears sometimes to be glandulous.\n\nOn the anterior surface of the arytenoid cartilages, there is a small depression between the basis and the convex upper part. This depression is filled by a glandulous body, which not only covers the anterior surface of each arytenoidea, but is likewise extended forward from the basis over the posterior extremity of the neighbouring ligamentary cord.\nThe epiglottis has likewise two lateral ligaments, by which it is connected to the arytenoides, all the way to their points or cornua. It has also a membranous ligament, which running along the middle of its anterior or concave side, ties it to the root or basis of the tongue. This ligament is only a duplicature of the membrane which covers the epiglottis, continued to the neighbouring parts. Lastly, there are two lateral membranous ligaments belonging to it, fixed near the glandulous bodies called amygdala.\n\nThe epiglottis is not only perforated by the regular holes already mentioned, but has likewise a great number of small irregular fissures and breaks, which are so many different lacunae situated between its two membranes, and filled with small glands, the excretory orifices of which are chiefly on the backside of this cartilage.\n\nThe larynx gives insertion to a number of muscles, which shall now be described.\n\nThe sterno-thyroides are two long, flat, narrow, thin muscles, like ribbons, broader above than below, and situated along that part of the neck which lies between the thyroid cartilage and the sternum. They are covered by the sterno-hyoidei, and they cover the thyroid glands, passing immediately before them.\n\nEach muscle is fixed, by its lower extremity, partly in the superior portion of the inner or backside of the sternum, partly in the ligament and neighbouring portion of the clavicle, and partly in the cartilaginous portion of the first rib. Sometimes it runs a great way down on the first bone of the sternum, and crosses the muscle on the other side. From thence it runs up on the alpina arteria, close by its fellow, passes before the thyroid glands, over the cricoid cartilage; and is inserted, by its upper extremity, in the lower part of the lateral side of the thyroid cartilage, and partly along that whole side.\n\nThe thyro-hyoidei, or hyo-thyroides are two flat, thin muscles, lying close by each other, between and above the former. Each of them is inserted, by its upper extremity, partly in the basis, and partly in the neighbouring part of the great cornua of the os hyoides; and by its lower extremity, in the lower part of the lateral side of the thyroid cartilage, immediately above the superior extremity of the sterno-thyroides; and both this superior extremity of the last named muscle, and the lower extremity of the thyro-hyoideus, are, at their place of union, confounded a little with the thyro-pharyngeus inferior.\n\nThe crico-thyroides are two small muscles, situated obliquely at the lower part of the thyroid cartilage. They are inserted by their lower extremities in the anterior portion of the cricoid cartilage, near each other, and by their superior extremities, laterally in the lower edge of the thyroid cartilage, at a distance from each other.\n\nThe two musculi crico-arytenoides posteriores are situated posteriorly at the large or back portion of the cri- coides, filling almost the two longitudinal surfaces of that portion, and distinguished by the prominent line between these two surfaces. Each of them runs up obliquely, and is inserted, by its upper extremity, in the posterior part of the basis of the arytenoid cartilage of the same side, near the angle of that basis.\n\nVol. I. No. 13.\n\nThe two crico-arytenoides are small, and situated more laterally than the former. Each muscle is fixed by one end to the side of the broad part of the cri- coides, and by the other to the lower part of the side of the neighbouring arytenoides.\n\nThe two thyro-arytenoides are very broad, each mus- cle being situated laterally between the thyroids and cri- coides. It is fixed by a broad insertion in the infide of the ala of the thyroid cartilage; and the fibres contracting from thence, run from before backward, and from below upward, towards the neighbouring arytenoid car- tilage, in which they are inserted, from the glottis to the angle of the basis.\n\nThe arytenoides are small muscles lying on the poste- rior concave sides of the arytenoid cartilages, of which two are called crucial arytenoides, and one transversa.\n\nThe crucial muscles run each obliquely from the basis of one arytenoid cartilage, to the middle and upper part of the other, the left muscle covering the right.\n\nThe arytenoideus transversalis is inserted more or less directly, by both extremities, in the two arytenoid car- tilages.\n\nThe two thyro-epiglottici cross the thyro-arytenoides, being inserted in the inner lateral part of the thyroids, and laterally in the epiglottis.\n\nThe aryteno-epiglottici are small fleshy fasciculi, each of which is fixed by one extremity in the head of one of the arytenoid cartilages, and by the other in the near-est edge of the epiglottis.\n\nThe larynx serves particularly to admit and let out the matter of respiration; and the solidity of the pieces of which it is composed hinders not only external objects, but also any hard thing which we swallow, from disfor- dering this passage. The glottis, being a narrow slit, modifies the air which we breathe; and as it is very easily dilated and contracted, it forms the different tones of the voice, chiefly by means of the different muscles in- serted in the cartilagines arytenoides, to which the other muscles of the larynx are assistants.\n\nThe whole larynx is likewise of use in deglutition, by means of its connection with the os hyoides, to which the digastric muscles of the lower jaw adhere; which muscles raise the larynx together with the os hyoides every time we swallow.\n\nThe facility of varying and changing the tone of the voice, depends on the flexibility of the cartilages of the larynx, and decreases in proportion as we advance in age, because these cartilages gradually harden and ossify.\n\nThe musculi sterno-thyroides serve in general to pull down the thyroid cartilage, and the whole larynx along with it. The thyro-hyoidei may, as occasion requires, either draw up the larynx toward the os hyoides, or draw that bone downward toward the cartilago thyroidea.\n\nIt is difficult to determine the use of the crico-thyro- d\u00e6i from their situations. They may either pull the cri- coides obliquely, backward, or the thyroides obliquely forward.\n\nBoth the lateral and posterior crico-arytenoides, may separate the arytenoid cartilages, and thereby open or dilate the glottis.\n\nThe thyro-arytenoides acting together, draw both the\narytenoid cartilages forward; and consequently loosen the glottis, and render it capable of the smallest quaverings of the voice.\n\nThe arytenoidei bring the arytenoid cartilages close together, and press them against each other; and when the cartilages are in this situation, they may at the same time be inclined either forward by the thyro-arytenoidei, or backward by the crico-arytenoidei posteriores. By this means the glottis, when shut, may be either relaxed or tense; and in this last case it is entirely shut, as when we hold in our breath in straining.\n\nThe general use of the epiglottis is to cover the glottis like a pent-house, and thereby hinder any thing from falling into it when we eat or drink; it serves likewise to hinder the air which we inspire from rushing directly upon the glottis, but by splitting it, as it were, obliges it to enter by the sides, or in an oblique course. The muscles of the epiglottis do not appear to be absolutely necessary for that cartilage; for in deglutition, it may be sufficiently depressed by the basis of the tongue; and it may raise itself again by its own elasticity. The thyro-epiglottici and aryteno-epiglottici may serve to shut any lateral openings that might remain when the epiglottis is depressed by the basis of the tongue; and the hyo-epiglottici may pull it a little forward in strong respirations, as in sighing, yawning, &c.\n\n**The Pharynx.**\n\nThe pharynx is a muscular and glandular bag, the outer surface of which is closely joined to the inner surface of all that space which is at the bottom of the mouth, behind the posterior nares, uvula, and larynx, and which reaches from the great or anterior apophysis of the os occipitis all the way to the oesophagus, which is the continuation of the pharynx.\n\nThough almost all the muscular or fleshy portions of which the pharynx is composed, concur in the formation of one contained bag or receptacle, they are nevertheless very distinguishable from each other, not only by their different insertions, from which they have been denominated, but also by the different directions of their fibres. The greatest part of them may be looked upon as digestive muscles, the middle tendons of which lie backward in one longitudinal line, which in some subjects appears plainly like a linea alba.\n\nThe cephalo-pharyngei are inserted in the lower side of the apophysis basilaris, or great apophysis of the os occipitis, about the middle of the posterior part. From thence they separate laterally, and sometimes join the stylo-pharyngei. The linea alba of the pharynx begins by the middle adhesion of these muscles.\n\nThe petro-pharyngei are inserted in the lower part of the extremity of the apophysis petroa; the spheno-pharyngei, partly in the os sphenoides, directly above the internal ala of the apophysis pterygoidei, and partly in the neighbouring cartilaginous portion of the Eustachian tube; and the pterygo-pharyngei, in the edge of the same ala of the apophysis pterygoidei. These three muscles on each side run obliquely backward, covering each other by some fibres, and meet at the linea alba. Their use may be to draw the middle portion or great cavity of the pharynx upward.\n\nThe stylo-pharyngei are inserted internally by one extremity in the apophysis, or epiphysis styloides. From thence each muscle runs down obliquely along the lateral part of the pharynx, covering and crossing the other muscles. It extends gradually in breadth as it descends, and forms two principal portions, one superior which is narrow, and one inferior which is broad. The narrow portion is spread among the muscular fibres above the thyroid cartilage, and the broad portion is inserted in the side of that cartilage; and thus the stylo-pharyngeus is partly a true stylo-thyroidaeus. These muscles may draw the pharynx laterally upward, especially by their thyroid portions.\n\nThe pterygo-pharyngei are two small muscles inserted between the uvula and lower extremity of the internal ala of the apophysis pterygoidei, and run obliquely backward on the sides of the pharynx. The gloso-pharyngei are fibres which run along the lateral edges of the tongue, from which they are parted backward, and run down on the sides of the pharynx under the stylo-pharyngei.\n\nThe hyo-pharyngei in general are those on each side which are inserted in the os hyoides; and they may be reckoned three pairs, the bato-pharyngei, kerato-pharyngei minores, and kerato-pharyngei majores; these denominations being taken from their insertions in the basis, and in the small and great cornua of the os hyoides.\n\nThe myo-pharyngei is a muscular portion distinct from the genio-glossus, inserted in the side of the pharynx.\n\nThe syndesmo-pharyngei are fasciculi of muscular fibres very distinctly inserted by one end along the ligaments by which the superior cornua of the cartilage thyroidei are connected to the extremities of the great cornua of the os hyoides. From thence they run backward and meet at the linea alba.\n\nThe thyro-pharyngei are very broad, and each muscle is inserted along the outside of the ala of the cartilago thyroidei, between the edge of that cartilage and the oblique line in which the thyro-hyoidei are fixed. From thence they run up obliquely backward, and meet under the linea alba.\n\nThe crico-pharyngei are inserted each in the lower part of the side of the cricoid cartilage. They seem to be appendices of the thyro-pharyngei, shewing no other marks of distinction but these insertions, and a small difference in direction, because as they run backward they descend a little.\n\nThe lowest of these muscular fibres make a complete circle backward, between the two sides of the basis of the cartilago cricoidei. This circle is the beginning of the oesophagus, and has been thought by some to form a distinct muscle, called oesophagus.\n\nThe particular uses of all these muscles are very difficult to be determined. It is certain that those of the middle and lower portions of the pharynx serve chiefly for deglutition.\nThe palate is that arch or cavity of the mouth, surrounded anteriorly by the alveolar edge and teeth of the upper jaw, and reaching from thence to the great opening of the pharynx. This arch is partly solid and immovable, and partly soft and moveable. The solid portion is that which is bounded by the teeth, being formed by the two osa maxillaria, and two osa palati. The soft portion lies behind the other, and runs backward like a veil fixed to the edge of the osa palati, being formed partly by the common membrane of the whole arch, and partly by several muscular fasciculi, &c.\n\nThe membrane that covers all this cavity is like that which lines the superior and middle portions of the pharynx. It is very thick set with small glands, the orifices of which are not so sensible as in the pharynx, and especially in the rugae of the superior portion thereof.\n\nThis membrane, together with that of the posterior nares, forms, by an uninterrupted continuation, the anterior and posterior surface of the soft portion, or septum palati; so that the muscular fasciculi of this portion lie in the duplicature of a glandulous membrane.\n\nThe septum, which may likewise be termed velum, or valvula palati, terminates below by a loose floating edge, representing an arch situated transversely above the basis or root of the tongue. The highest portion or top of this arch sustains a small, soft, and irregularly conical glandulous body, fixed by its basis to the arch, and its apex hanging down without adhering to anything, which is called uvula.\n\nOn each side of the uvula there are two muscular half arches, called columnae septi palati. They are all joined to the uvula by their upper extremities, and disposed in such a manner as that the lower extremities of the two which lie on the same side are at a little distance from each other, and so as that one half-arch is anterior, the other posterior, an oblong triangular space being left between them, the apex of which is turned toward the basis of the uvula.\n\nThe two half arches on one side, by joining the like half arches on the other side, form the entire arch of the edge of the septum. The posterior half arches run, by their upper extremities, more directly toward the uvula than the anterior. The anterior half arches have a continuation with the sides of the basis of the tongue, and the posterior with the sides of the pharynx. At the lower part of the space left between the lateral half arches on the same side, two glands are situated, termed amygdala.\n\nThe half arches are chiefly made up of several flat fleshy portions, almost in the same manner with the body of the septum. The membrane which covers them is thinner than the other parts of it towards the palate, pharynx, and tongue. Each portion is a distinct muscle, the greatest part of which terminate by one extremity in the substance of the septum and of the half arches, and by the other extremity in parts different from these.\n\nAs anatomists used formerly to ascribe all these muscles, as far as they knew them, to the uvula, without any regard to the septum, they termed them in general either pterygo-staphylini, or peri-staphylini.\n\nThe glosso-staphylini are two small muscles, fixed each in the lower and lateral part of the basis of the tongue; from whence they run up obliquely backward along the anterior half arches of the septum palati, and terminate insensibly on each side near the uvula, some of their fibres being spread through the septum.\n\nThe pharyngo-staphylini are likewise two small muscles, each of them being fixed by one extremity to the lateral part of the musculi thyro-pharyngei, as if they were portions detached from these muscles. From thence they run up obliquely forward along the two posterior half arches of the septum, and terminate in the septum above the uvula, where they meet together, and seem to form an entire arch by the union of their fibres.\n\nThe thyro-staphylini are two small muscles, which accompany the pharyngo-staphylini very closely, through their whole course, except that their posterior extremities are fixed in the thyroid cartilages near the other muscles. They are inserted in the septum in the same manner with the former.\n\nThe spheno-salpingo-staphylini are each fixed by one extremity, partly to the sphenoidal side of the bony portion of the Eustachian tube, partly to the nearest soft portion of the same tube. From thence it runs toward the external ala of the apophysis pterygoides, into which one portion of this muscle is inserted. The other portion runs to the end of the ala, and turns round to the forked extremity thereof, as over a pulley, and is afterwards inserted in the septum palati, near the uvula.\n\nThe pterygo-staphylinus superior is so named because it has a small insertion in the upper part of the apophysis pterygoides, besides that in the sphenoidal part of the bony portion of the tube. The pterygo-staphylinus inferior on each side, is a small muscle, inserted by one extremity in the uncus pterygoideus, and by the other in the septum near the uvula.\n\nThe petro-salpingo-staphylini, or salpingo-staphylini interni, are those which are commonly called peri-staphylini interni. Each muscle is fixed by one extremity, partly to the inner side of the bony portion of the Eustachian tube, or that next the apophysis petrosa, partly along the cartilaginous portion of the same tube. From thence it passes a little way under the soft membranous part, and then, turning toward the septum, is fixed in the edge, and partly in the upper side thereof.\n\nThe staphylini, or epistaphylini, are two small fleecy ropes, closely united together, as if they made but one muscle. They are fixed by one extremity in the common point of the posterior edges of the osa palati, and from thence run downward and backward along the middle of the septum, and likewise along the middle of almost the whole uvula. These muscles have been termed azigos Morgagni, from the discoverer, but he considered them as one muscle. The pterygo-staphylini inferiores are of the same kind, and might be termed staphylini, or epi-staphylini laterales, and these last, medii.\n\nThe septum palati serves to conduct the lachrymal lympha, and that which is continually collected on the arch of the palate, into the pharynx. It serves for a valve.\nvalve to hinder what we swallow; and especially what we drink, from returning by the nares. The uses of the different muscles of the septum are not as yet sufficiently known, nor the different motions of which it is capable.\n\n**The Tongue.**\n\nThe tongue is divided into the basis and point; the upper and under sides; and the lateral portions or edges. The basis is the posterior and thickest part; the point, the anterior and thinnest part. The upper side is not quite flat, but a little convex, and divided into two lateral halves, by a shallow depressed line, called linea linguae mediana. The edges are thinner than the other parts, and a little rounded as well as the point. The lower side reaches only from the middle of the length of the tongue to the point.\n\nThe tongue is principally composed of very soft fleety fibres, intermixed with a particular medullary substance, and disposed in various manners. Many of these fibres are confined to the tongue without going any farther, the rest form separate muscles which go out from it in different ways, and are inserted in other parts. All the upper side of the tongue is covered by a thick membrane of a papillary texture, upon which lies another very fine membrane like a kind of epidermis, which is likewise continued over the lower side, but without papillae.\n\nThree sorts of papillae may be distinguished in the upper side of the tongue, capitatae, semi-lenticulares, and villosae. Those of the first kind are the largest, resembling little mushrooms with short stems, or buttons without a neck. They lie on the basis of the tongue in small superficial fossulae.\n\nThey resemble small conglomerate glands seated on a very narrow basis, and each of them has sometimes a small depression in the middle of their upper or convex side. They occupy the whole surface of the basis of the tongue. They are glandular papillae, or small salivary or mucilaginous glands.\n\nWe oftentimes observe, about the middle of this part of the tongue, a particular hole of different depths, the inner surface of which is entirely glandular, and filled with small papillae, like those of the first kind. It is called foramen caecum Morgagnii, as being first described by that author. Since that time M. Vaterus has discovered a kind of salivary ducts belonging to it; and M. Heister found two of these ducts very distinctly, the orifices of which were in the bottom of the foramen caecum near each other. He observed the ducts to run backward, divericating a little from each other, and that one of them terminated in a small oblong vesicle situated on the side of the small cornu of the os hyoides.\n\nThe papillae of the second kind, or semi-lenticulares, are small orbicular eminences, only a little convex, their circular edge not being separate from the surface of the tongue. When we examine them in a sound tongue, with a good microscope, we find their convex sides full of small holes or pores, like the end of a thimble.\n\nThey lie chiefly in the middle and anterior portions of the tongue, and are sometimes most visible on the edges, where they appear to be very smooth and polished, even to the naked eye.\n\nThe papillae of the third kind, or villosae, are the smallest and most numerous. They fill the whole surface of the upper side of the tongue, and even the interspaces between the other papillae.\n\nThe fleety fibres of which the tongue is composed, and which go no further than the tongue, may be termed musculi linguae interiores; and they are the same which Spigelius named musculi linguales. The fibres these muscles consist of are of three general kinds, longitudinal, transverse, and vertical; and each of these situations admits of different degrees of obliquity. The longitudinal fibres point to the basis and apex of the tongue, and seem partly to be expansions of the musculi stylo-glossi, hyo-glossi, and genio-glossi; of which hereafter. The vertical fibres seem likewise to be in part produced by the same genio-glossi, and the transverse by the mylo-glossi.\n\nThe musculi exteriore are four in number, and make a part of the body of the tongue.\n\nThe mylo-glossi are small fleety planes, situated transversely, one on each side, between the ramus of the lower jaw, and the basis of the tongue. Their insertion in the jaw is immediately above the posterior half of the mylo-hyoideus, between the prominent oblique line on the inside of the bone, and the dentes molares. From thence they run toward the basis of the tongue, and are lost there on one side of the gloso-pharyngei.\n\nThe stylo-glossi are two long small muscles which run down from the styloid apophyses, or epiphyses, and form two portions of the lateral parts of the tongue. Each muscle is fixed in the outside of the apophysis styloides by a long tendon. The stylo-hyoideus is the lowest, and the stylo-pharyngeus is in the middle, but more backward.\n\nAs it runs down almost opposite to the inside of the angle of the lower jaw, it sends off a pretty broad and short lateral aponeurotic ligament, which being fixed in that angle serves for a frenum, or ligamentum suspensorium, to the muscle in this part of its course. From thence it passes on to the side of the basis of the tongue, where it first of all adheres closely to the lateral portion of the hyo-glossus, and then forms, together with that muscle, a large portion of the side of the tongue.\n\nThe hyo-glossi are each inserted in three parts of the os hyoides that lie near each other, in the basis, in the root of the great cornu, and in the symphysis between these two; and on this account the hyo-glossus has been divided by some into two or three distinct muscles, called baso-glossus, cerato-glossus, and chondro-glossus.\n\nIt is situated on the inside, and a little lower than the stylo-glossus, with which it forms the lateral part of the tongue. The portion inserted in the basis of the os hyoides lies more anteriorly, and is larger than the other two; that which is inserted in the symphysis is the least, and that inserted in the great cornu the most posterior. This muscle is partly sustained by the mylo-hyoideus, as by a girth; and the anterior portion is distinguished from the rest by the passage of the nerves of the fifth pair, and of the arteries which accompany them.\n\nThe genio-glossi are situated close to each other on the lower\nSome of them lie very near the skin, and the rest at a greater distance from it.\n\nAs these lymphatic glands differ more in situation than in size or figure, they are commonly enumerated and denominated from the places where they lie; e.g.,\n- Glandulae parotides lymphaticae,\n- Glandulae maxillares lymphaticae,\n- Glandulae jugulares, &c.\n\nThe lymphatic vessels were discovered more than a hundred years ago. But their nature and origin were not understood till Dr Alexander Monro, present Professor of Anatomy in the University of Edinburgh, published his treatise, De Venis Lymphaticis Valvulosis, in the year 1757. In this treatise the Doctor has proved, by many accurate experiments, that the lymphatic vessels are a system of absorbents: That they are not continuations of the arteries or veins; but that they are a distinct system of vessels, destined for absorbing a pellucid liquor called lymph, from the different cavities of the body, &c., and for transmitting it to the blood, by the contraction of their coats, and the pressure of the neighbouring parts.\n\nBesides these vessels which accompany the glands, there are others of the same structure found on the several viscera, where no lymphatic glands have hitherto been discovered. We meet with them in very great numbers in the external membrane of the liver, and in the duplicature of the superior membranous ligament of this viscus.\n\nAnother sort of vessels termed lymphatics, are the small arteries and veins, which, in the natural state, transmit only the serous part of the blood. These vessels differ from the absorbent lymphatics in the smallness of their diameter, and in their structure and situation. All these little arteries and veins are uniform, extremely narrow; and though their sides are not thinner than those of the valvular lymphatics, yet their diameters are generally less. The other lymphatics are full of valves, and very thin, but they are not narrow in proportion. The arterial and venal lymphatics are found on the parts which are naturally white, as on the skin, the white of the eye, &c.","sp":339,"ep":359},{"h":"MESOTHENAR","t":"This is a flat, and nearly triangular muscle, lying between the first phalanx of the thumb, and the bottom of the palm of the hand.\n\nIt is inserted, by a very broad basis, in the ligament which connects the os magnum of the carpus to that which supports the thumb.

This muscle is commonly thought to be a third small transversalis on that side where it is found, but it seems rather to be an additional muscle to the obliquus superior.\n\nUSES of the Muscles which move the Head on the Trunk.\n\nThe action of the sterno-mastoidei is different, according as either both muscles, or only one of them, acts, and according to the different situation of the head and trunk.\n\nWhen we keep the head and trunk straight, whether in standing or sitting, both muscles preserve the head in that posture against any force by which it would otherwise be moved backward.\n\nOne of these muscles acting alone, may have the same use, if the force to push the head back be applied between the anterior and lateral parts of it.\n\nThey both serve likewise to perform the rotations of the head, that is, to make it turn to either side as on a pivot; and, in this case, when we turn the head to one side, the sternomastoideus on the other side acts, and not that on the same side.\n\nThey both serve, in the next place, to bring the head near the thorax when we lie on the back, or bend backward in sitting. In this case, the sternum, being the fixed point, must remain immoveable; but as its connection with the first rib, and the inflexibility of the cartilage of that rib, are not always sufficient for this, the musculi recti of the abdomen must lend their assistance in great efforts.\n\nThe two splenii serve to support the head in an erect posture, whether in standing or sitting; to moderate the flexion of the head forward, and to bring it back again to its natural posture.\n\nThey serve alternately to co-operate with either of the sternomastoidei, for the rotation of the head: Thus when the right sternomastoideus turns the head, the left splenius corresponds with it by its upper part; while the lower part at the same time turns the vertebrae of the neck.\n\nThe complexi are assistants to the splenii, to keep the head straight in sitting or standing, to hinder it from inclining forward, and to raise it when inclined.\n\nThe recti majores, and minores postici, and obliqui superiores, turn the head a little backward on the first vertebra of the neck. The recti majores contribute most to this motion; and the minores seem likewise to hinder the articular membranes from being pinched between the bones in great motions.\n\nThe recti majores and minores antici, and the two transversales antici, move the head forward on the first vertebra; and the recti minores, and transversales breves, likewise defend the capsular ligaments.\n\nThe obliqui inferiores or majores are true rotators of the head, by turning the first vertebra upon the odontoid apophysis of the second; all which alternate motions the head follows, without being hindered in the motions forward and backward in any degree of rotation.\n\nOf the transversales antici, the first only move the head in the manner above mentioned; neither can they perform any other motions, their insertions being confined to the os occipitis and first vertebra. The transversales antici secundi have no share in the particular motions of the head, but ought rather to be ranked among the muscles which move the vertebrae of the neck.\n\nThe complexi minores belong to the head only by their superior portions; the other portions belonging rather to the neck. They may serve alternately in the lateral motions of the head, and thereby co-operate with the splenii.\nnious and sterno-mastoidaeus of the same side, when these two act together; and they may likewise be of use to preserve the capsular ligaments to which they adhere.\n\nThe small accessorii, when they are found, have the same uses with the muscles to which they are supernumerary.\n\n**Sect. XV. Of the Vertebral Muscles.**\n\n**LONGUS COLLIS.**\n\nThis vertebral muscle is made up of several others, situated laterally along the fore-side of all the vertebrae of the neck, and some of the upper vertebrae of the back.\n\nIt may be divided into two portions; one superior, consisting of oblique converging muscles; and one inferior, composed of oblique diverging muscles.\n\nThe superior portion is covered by the rectus anticus longus of the head. The muscles, of which it consists, are fixed below to the transverse apophyses that lie between the first vertebra and the last. From thence they run up obliquely, and are inserted in the anterior eminence of the first vertebra, and in the bodies of the three following.\n\nThe inferior portion appears almost straight, and yet all the muscles that compose it are diverging, or directed obliquely outward. They are fixed below to the anterior lateral part of the body of the last vertebra of the neck, and of the first three of the back, and sometimes of more. From thence they run upward, and a little obliquely outward, and are inserted near the transverse apophyses of all the vertebrae of the neck, except the first and last.\n\n**TRANSVERSALES COLLIS MAJOR.**\n\nThis is a long thin muscle, placed along all the transverse apophyses of the neck, and the four, five, or six upper apophyses of the back, between the complexus major and minor.\n\nIt is composed of several small muscular fasciculi, which run directly from one or more transverse apophyses, and are inserted sometimes in the apophysis nearest to these, sometimes in others more remote, the several fasciculi crossing each other between the insertions of the two complexi, which are likewise crossed by them.\n\n**TRANSVERSALES GRACILIS ET COLATERALES COLLIS.**\n\nThis is a long thin muscle, resembling the transversalis major in every thing but size, and situated on the side of that muscle.\n\n**SEMI-SPINALIS ET TRANSVERSO-SPINALIS COLLIS.**\n\nThis name is given to all that fleshy mass which lies between the transverse and spinal apophyses, from the second vertebra of the neck, to the middle of the back.\n\nIt is composed of several oblique converging mus-\n\ncles, which may be divided into external and internal.\n\nThe external are fixed below to the transverse apophyses of the six, seven, eight, or nine upper vertebrae of the back, by tendinous extremities, which, as they ascend, become fleshy, and mix with each other. Their superior insertions in the neck are six in number, whereof the first, which is tendinous, is in the seventh spinal apophysis; the rest, which are fleshy, are in the five next spinal apophyses.\n\nThe internal are shorter and more oblique than the external, and partly covered by them. They are fixed, by their lower extremities, to the transverse apophyses of the three or four upper vertebrae of the back, and to the oblique apophyses of the four or five lower vertebrae of the neck; and, by their other extremities, they are inserted in the six spinal apophyses of the neck.\n\n**SPINALES COLLIS MINORES.**\n\nThese muscles lie between the six spinal apophyses of the neck, and between the last of the neck and first of the back, being inserted in these apophyses, by both extremities, on one side of the posterior cervical ligament, which parts them from those on the other side.\n\n**TRANSVERSALES COLLIS MINORES.**\n\nThese are very small short muscles, found in the interstices of several transverse apophyses in which they are inserted. They are likewise termed inter-transversales.\n\n**SACRO-LUMBARIS.**\n\nThis is a long complex muscle, narrow and thin at the upper part, broad and thick at the lower, representing a kind of flat pyramid. It lies between the spine and posterior part of all the ribs, and along the back-part of the regio lumbaris, all the way to the os sacrum.\n\nThrough all this space, it is closely accompanied by the longissimus dorsi, which lies between it and the spinal apophyses of the vertebrae, a narrow, fatty, or cellular line running between them.\n\nIt is fixed below, by a broad thin tendinous aponeurosis, to the superior spines of the os sacrum, and to the neighbouring lateral parts of that bone; and, lastly, to the external labium of the posterior part of the crista ossis ilium, all the way to the great tuberosity.\n\nFrom thence this muscle runs upward, and a little laterally, over all the regio lumbaris; the aponeurosis fending off, from its inside, a mass of fleshy fibres, which are divided, from below upwards, into several large fasciculi, inserted in all the transverse apophyses of the loins.\n\nAfterwards it runs up obliquely over all the ribs, sometimes as high as the two or three lowest vertebrae of the neck, sometimes higher, and sometimes it ends at the first vertebra of the back.\n\n**LONGISSIMUS DORSI.**\n\nThis is a very complex, long, and narrow muscle, something...\nsomething like the sacro-lumbaris, but more fleshy and thicker, situated between the spinal apophyses and the muscle just mentioned, from which it is divided by a small, fatty, or cellular line; but at the lower part they are confounded together. It covers the semi-spinalis, or transverso-spinalis dorsi, and the semi-spinalis lumborum. Its upper part lies between the sacro-lumbaris and transversalis colli.\n\nIts inferior insertions are partly by distinct tendinous portions, and by a broad aponeurosis common to it with the sacro-lumbaris; and partly by a large fasciculi of fleshy fibres, which, at first sight, seem to compose one uniform mass. It is fixed, by the long, flat, tendinous portions of different breadths, to the last spinal apophysis of the back, to all those of the loins, and to one or two of the superior spines of the os sacrum. These portions lie at different distances from each other, but are all connected by a thin aponeurosis fixed to their edges.\n\nFrom thence they run up obliquely, diverging from the apophyses; and, beginning to be fleshy at their inner or anterior sides, they terminate above in small roundish tendons, inserted in the extremities of the seven upper transverse apophyses of the back, and in the neighbouring ligaments of all the true ribs.\n\nThe other inferior insertion wholly fleshy, is partly in the inner or foreside of the aponeurosis of the sacro-lumbaris, and partly in the upper portion of the os sacrum, being from thence continued to the great tuberosity of the os illium.\n\nFrom thence this uniform mass of fleshy fibres runs up in a course almost direct, crossing the tendinous portions which are more oblique; and join the inferior fibres of the sacro-lumbaris by large fasciculi inserted in the transverse and oblique apophyses of the vertebrae of the loins. The fibres of this portion go afterwards to the ribs, being inserted by planes more or less fleshy, in the lower convex edge of all the false ribs, between the condyles or tubercles and the angles.\n\nAt the sixth or seventh vertebra of the back, one or more of the tendinous portions often communicate with some fasciculi of the semi-spinalis, or transverso-spinalis dorsi.\n\n**SPINALIS DORSI MAJOR.**\n\nThis is a pretty long and slender muscle, lying upon the lateral part of the extremities of the spinal apophysis of the back.\n\nIt is composed of several muscular fasciculi of different lengths, which, crossing each other, are inserted laterally by small tendons in the spinal apophyses from the second, third, or fourth vertebra of the back; and sometimes, though seldom, from the last of the neck, or first of the back, all the way to the first or second vertebra of the loins, with several irregular decussations, which vary in different subjects.\n\n**SPINALES DORSI MINORES.**\n\nThese muscles are of two kinds. Some go laterally from the extremity of one spinal apophysis to another; being often mixed with the short fasciculi of the spinalis major. The rest lie directly between the extremities of two neighbouring spinal apophyses, being separated from their fellows on the other side by the spinal ligament. They are smaller and thinner than those of the neck, and are properly enough termed inter-spinales.\n\n**TRANSVERSALES DORSI MINORES.**\n\nSome particular muscles of this kind are found fixed to the extremities of the three lowest transverse apophyses of the back. The rest are all in some measure continuations of the transversalis major.\n\n**SEMI-SPINALIS ET TRANSVERSO-SPINALIS DORSI.**\n\nThis is a fleshy mass, which, from all the spinal and transverse apophyses of the back and loins, is extended into distinct fasciculi over the vertebrae themselves.\n\nIt is made up, like that of the neck, of several oblique converging vertebral muscles, the uppermost of which is fixed below to the third transverse apophysis of the back, and above to the first spinal apophysis. The lowest is fixed below to the third transverse apophysis of the loins, and above to the last spinal apophysis of the back.\n\nThey may be divided into external, which are first discovered; and internal, which lie immediately on the vertebrae. The external, from the first vertebra to the seventh, inclusively, appear to be longer than the internal, which are covered by them.","sp":261,"ep":263},{"h":"MUSCULI PYRAMIDALES","t":"At the lower part of the recti, we meet commonly with two small muscles, which at first seem to be a portion or appendix of the former.

It is situated transversely between the tuberosity of the ischium and the great trochanter.\n\nIt is fixed by one extremity along that obtuse line which runs from under the acetabulum, toward the lower part of the tuberosity of the ischium. From thence it runs directly toward the great trochanter, and is inserted in almost all the lower half of the oblong eminence in that apophysis; but chiefly in the small rising or tuberosity in the middle of that eminence.\n\n**MUSCULUS FASCIAE LAT\u00c6.**\n\nThis is a small and pretty long muscle, situated a little obliquely upward and downward on the forepart of the hip.\n\nIt is fixed above to the outside of the anterior superior spine of the os ilium, between the insertions of the gluteus medius and sartorius. From thence its flethy fibres run down a little obliquely backward, forming a very flat body, four fingers breadth in length, and two in breadth.\n\nThis body lies between two laminae of the fascia lata, and is inserted therein by short tendinous fibres, which disappear at that place where the fascia adheres to the great trochanter and tendon of the gluteus maximus.\n\n**USES of the Muscles which move the Os Femoris on the Pelvis.**\n\nThe gluteus maximus serves chiefly, by its posterior portion, to extend the os femoris, and to draw it backward. By its anterior portion, it may co-operate with the rest in performing the abduction of the thigh; but when we sit, it can do this office only by its posterior portion.\n\nBy its insertion in the os coccygis, it may on some occasions bring it forward, and hinder it from being thrust too far backward, as in the excretion of hardened faeces, or in difficult births.\n\nThe gluteus medius is commonly, but falsely, reckoned an extensor of the thigh. Its use is to separate one thigh from the other, when we stand, and that more or less directly according to the action of its anterior, posterior, or middle portions.\n\nWhen we sit, the only use of this muscle is to perform the rotation of the os femoris about its axis, in such a manner, that if the leg be bent at the same time, it shall be separated from the other.\n\nThe glutaeus minimus has likewise been reckoned an extensor of the thigh, but without any foundation. It assists the glutaeus medius in the abdution of the thigh when we stand, and in the rotation when we sit.\n\nThe psoas bends the thigh on the pelvis, or brings it forward. It may likewise move the pelvis on the thighs, and hinder it from being carried along with the rest of the trunk, when the body is inclined backward while we sit, having the lower extremities fixed by some external force. In this situation it may likewise move the vertebrae of the loins.\n\nThe iliacus is a congener or assistant to the psoas, in bringing the thigh forward and upward. It may likewise move the pelvis in the same manner with the former.\n\nThe pectineus is an assistant to the two former muscles in moving both the thigh and the pelvis. It may likewise assist in bringing the thigh inward, or toward the other, whether it be extended or bent at the same time.\n\nThe three triceps muscles join in the same use; that is, to move the thigh inward, and bring the two thighs near each other; as when, in riding, we press the thighs close against the saddle; when, in sitting, we hold anything close between the knees; when we cross the thighs; or when, in standing, we bring the legs close together, in order to jump.\n\nThe use of these muscles is likewise to hinder the thighs from separating more than is convenient, especially in great efforts and jerks.\n\nThe pyriformis, gemelli, and quadratus, called likewise by the common name of quadrigemini, are congeners in their uses; and these have been confined by anatomists to the rotation of the os femoris about its axis from before outward; when we stand or lie at full length; likewise in sitting, or when the thigh is bent in any other posture, they carry the thigh outward, or separate the two thighs from each other when bent.\n\nAll the four co-operate in these two uses of rotation and abduction; but they co-operate equally or unequally, according to the different degrees of the extension or flexion of the thigh.\n\nThe obturator internus has nearly the same uses with the quadrigemini, in making the rotation of the thigh when extended, and the abdution when bent.\n\nThe obturator externus concurs with the internus in the same uses, though in a more simple manner, and in a more uniform direction. It acts chiefly when the thigh is extended more or less.\n\nThe musculus fasciae lat\u00e6 makes a rotation from before inwards, that is, in a contrary direction to that made by the quadrigemini and obturator internus; and this rotation is not so much confined as that of the quadrigemini, because it may have place whether the thigh be bent or extended.\n\n**SECT.**\nSect. X. The Muscles which move the Bones of the Leg on the Os Femoris.\n\nRectus Anterior five Gracilis Anterior.\n\nThis muscle is as long as the os femoris; and lies directly along the foreside of the thigh, from whence it has the name of rectus anterior.\n\nIt terminates above, by a pretty strong tendon, which is divided into two branches, one short and straight, the other long and bent. The short branch, running up in a straight line, is inserted in the anterior inferior spine of the os ilium.\n\nThe long branch is inflected backward over the supercilium of the acetabulum, and runs in the direction thereof, from the spine toward the great ischiatric sinus. It is strong and flat, adhering very closely to the bone, and covered by the orbicular ligament and the gluteus minimus.\n\nFrom thence the muscle runs down wholly flebby, and partly penniform, some of its fibres meeting above and separating below. It is narrow at the upper extremity, and grows gradually broader toward the middle. Afterwards it contracts again in the same manner, and, at the lower extremity of the os femoris, ends in a flat broad tendon.\n\nVastus Externus.\n\nThis is a very large flebby muscle, almost as long as the os femoris, broad at the extremities, and thick in the middle, lying on the outside of the thigh.\n\nIts upper insertion, being something tendinous, is in the posterior or convex rough surface of the great trochanter. It is likewise fixed by a flebby insertion along the outside of the os femoris for above two thirds of its length downward, in the corresponding part of the linea aspera, and in the neighbouring portion of the fascia lata.\n\nFrom all this extent the flebby fibres running downward, and a little obliquely forward toward the rectus anterior, terminate insensibly in a kind of short aponeurosis, which is fixed in all the nearest edge of the tendon of the rectus, in the side of the patella, in the edge of the ligament of that bone, and in the neighbouring lateral part of the head of the tibia.\n\nVastus Internus.\n\nThis muscle is very like the former, and situated in the same manner on the inside of the os femoris.\n\nIt is fixed above by a short flat tendon, in the anterior rough surface of the great trochanter, and by flebby fibres in that oblique line which terminates the basis of the collum femoris anteriorly, on the foreside of the insertions of the psoas and iliacus, in the whole inside of the os femoris, and in the linea aspera on one side of the insertions of the three tricipites, almost down to the internal condyle.\n\nFrom all this extent the fibres run downward, and a little obliquely forward, and the body of the muscle increases in the same manner as the vastus internus. It terminates below in an aponeurosis, which is fixed in the edge of the tendon of the rectus anterior, in the side of the patella, and of its tendinous ligament, and in the side of the head or upper extremity of the tibia.\n\nCrureus.\n\nThis is a flebby mass, covering almost all the foreside of the os femoris between the two vasti, which likewise cover the edges of this muscle on each side.\n\nIt is fixed to the foreside of the os femoris, from the anterior surface of the great trochanter down to the lowest quarter of the bone, by flebby fibres which run down successively over each other, between the two vasti, and are partly united to these two muscles, so as not to seem to form a distinct muscle.\n\nIt is not so thick as the two vasti; and as it is covered by them on each side, a sort of flebby channel is formed by all the three, in which the rectus is lodged, covering the forepart of the crureus.\n\nIt terminates below in a tendinous aponeurosis, which joins the backside of the tendon of the rectus anterior, and the neighbouring edges of the extremities of the two vasti. Thus, these four muscles form a common tendon, which is inserted in the places already mentioned.\n\nSartorius.\n\nThis is the longest muscle of the human body. It is flat, and about two fingers in breadth, situated obliquely along the inside of the thigh.\n\nIt is fixed above by a very short tendon, in the lower part of the anterior superior spine of the os ilium, before the musculus fasciae latae. The beginning of its body lies in the notch between the two anterior spines of that bone.\n\nFrom thence it runs down obliquely over the vastus internus and other muscles that lie near it, all the way to the inside of the knee, where it terminates in a small tendon, which grows broader near its extremity, and is inserted obliquely and a little tranversely in the forepart of the inside of the head of the tibia, near the spine or tuberosity of that bone, immediately above the insertion of the gracilis interior.\n\nGracilis Interior five Rectus Interior.\n\nThis is a long thin muscle, lying in a straight line on the inside of the thigh, between the os pubis and the knee.\n\nIt is fixed in the edge of the inferior branch of the os pubis, near the lymphatics, by a broad and very short tendon, on one side of the insertion of the triceps secundus, but a little lower down.\n\nFrom thence the flebby fibres contracting a little in breadth, run down to the internal condyle of the os femoris, where they terminate in a thin tendon, which afterwards degenerates into a kind of aponeurosis, and is inserted in the fore-part of the inside of the head of the tibia.\n\nBiceps.","sp":247,"ep":249},{"h":"OBTURATOR INTERNUS","t":"This is a flat muscle, almost triangular, situated in the bottom of the pelvis.

It is likewise fixed to the upper half of the inside of the os ischium from the upper oblique notch in the foramen ovale, to the superior part of the great posterior sinus of the os ilium.\n\nFrom all this extent the fleshy fibres, contracting in breadth, run down below the spine of the ischium, where they go out of the pelvis through the posterior notch of the ischium, and afterwards unite in one large flat tendon, which crossing over that of the pyriformis, unites with it, having first received on each side some additional fleshy fibres from the two gemelli.","sp":247,"ep":247},{"h":"OF ARCHES","t":"Arches are not so magnificent as colonnades; but they are more solid, and less expensive. They are proper for triumphal entrances, gates of cities, of palaces, of gardens, and of parks; and, in general, for all openings that require an extraordinary breadth.\n\nThere are various manners of adorning arches. Sometimes their piers are rusticated; sometimes they are adorned with pilasters, termini, or caryatides; and sometimes they are made sufficiently broad to admit niches, or windows. The circular part of the arch is either surrounded with rustic key-stones, or with an archivolt enriched with mouldings; which, in the middle, is sometimes interrupted by a console, a mask, serving at the same time as a key to the arch, and as a support to the architrave of the order. The archivolt is sometimes supported by an impost, at the head of the pier; and, at others, by columns placed on each side of it, with a regular entablature, or architrave cornice. There are likewise instances of arcades without piers, the arches being turned on single columns, as in the temple of Faunus at Rome, &c. This practice, however, ought to be seldom imitated, as it is neither solid nor handsome.\n\nWhen arches are large, the key-stone should never be omitted, but cut in the form of a console, and carried close under the soffit of the architrave, which, on account of its extraordinary length, requires a support in the middle. The imposts of arches should never be omitted; at least, if they be, a platform ought to supply their place. If columns are employed without pedestals in arcades, they should always be raised on a plinth. In all arches, the circular part ought not to spring immediately from the impost, but take its rise at such a distance above it, as is necessary in order to have the whole curve seen at the proper point of view.\n\nThe void or aperture of arches should never be higher, nor much lower, than double their breadth; the breadth of the pier should seldom exceed two thirds, nor be less than one third, of the breadth of the arch; and the angular pier ought to be broader than the others, by one half, one third, or one fourth; the impost should not be more than one seventh, nor less than one ninth of the aperture; and the archivolt must not be more than one eighth, nor less than one tenth of it. The breadth of the console must, at the bottom, be equal to that of the archivolt; and its sides must be drawn from the centre of the arch: The length of it must not be less than one and a half of its smallest breadth, nor more than double. The thickness of the pier depends on the breadth of the portico; for it must be strong enough to resist the pressure of its vault. But, with regard to the beauty of the building, it should not be less than one quarter of the breadth of the arch, nor more than one third. These are the general dimensions of arches.","sp":421,"ep":421},{"h":"OF ARCHITECTURE AS AN OBJECT OF TASTE","t":"Many ages must have elapsed before architecture came to be considered as a fine art. Utility was its original destination, and still continues to be its principal end. Experience, however, has taught us, that architecture is capable of exciting a variety of agreeable feelings. Of these, utility, grandeur, regularity, order, and proportion, are the chief.\n\nArchitecture being an useful as well as a fine art, leads us to distinguish buildings, and parts of buildings, into three kinds, viz. what are intended for use solely, what for ornament solely, and what for both. Buildings intended for utility solely, ought in every part to correspond precisely to that intention: The least deviation from use, though contributing to ornament, will be disagreeable; for every work of use being considered as a mean to an end, its perfection as a mean is the capital circumstance, and every other beauty in opposition is neglected as improper. On the other hand, in such things as are intended solely for ornament, as columns, obelisks, triumphal arches, &c. beauty alone ought to be regarded. The principal difficulty in architecture lies in combining use and ornament. In order to accomplish these ends, different and even opposite means must be employed; which is the reason why they are so seldom united in perfection; and hence, in buildings of this kind, the only practicable method is, to prefer utility to ornament according to the character of the building: In palaces, and such buildings as admit of a variety of useful contrivance, regularity ought to be preferred; but in dwelling-houses that are too small for variety of contrivance, utility ought to prevail, neglecting regularity as far as it stands in opposition to convenience.\n\nIn considering attentively the beauty of visible objects, we discover two kinds. The first may be termed intrinsic beauty, because it is discovered in a single object, without relation to any other. The second may be termed relative beauty, being founded on a combination of relative objects. Architecture admits of both kinds. We shall first give a few examples of relative beauty.\n\nThe proportions of a door are determined by the use to which it is destined. The door of a dwelling-house, which ought to correspond to the human size, is confined to seven or eight feet in height, and three or four in breadth. The proportions proper for a stable or coach-house are different. The door of a church ought to be wide, in order to afford an easy passage for a multitude; and its height must be regulated by its wideness, that the proportion may please the eye. The size of the win-\ndows ought always to be proportioned to that of the room they are destined to illuminate; for if the apertures be not large enough to convey light to every corner, the room must be unequally lighted, which is a great deformity. Steps of stairs should likewise be accommodated to the human figure, without regarding any other proportion; they are accordingly the same in large and in small buildings, because both are inhabited by men of the same size.\n\nWe shall next consider intrinsic beauty, blended with that which is relative. A cube in itself is more agreeable than a parallelopipedon; this constantly holds in small figures; but a large building in the form of a cube is lumpish and heavy; while a parallelopipedon, set on its smaller base, is more agreeable on account of its elevation: Hence the beauty of Gothic towers. But if this figure were to be used in a dwelling-house, to make way for relative beauty, we would immediately perceive that utility ought chiefly to be regarded; and this figure, inconvenient by its height, ought to be set on its larger base: The loftiness in this case would be lost; but that loss will be more than sufficiently compensated by the additional convenience. Hence the form of buildings spread more upon the ground than raised in height, is always preferred for a dwelling-house.\n\nWith regard to the internal divisions, utility requires that the rooms be rectangular, to avoid useless spaces. An hexagonal figure leaves no void spaces; but it determines the rooms to be all of one size, which is both inconvenient and disagreeable for want of variety. The cube be the most agreeable figure, and may answer for a room of a moderate size; yet, in a very large room, utility requires a different figure. Unconfined motion is the chief convenience of a great room; to obtain this, the greatest length that can be had is necessary. But a square room of a large size is inconvenient. It removes chairs, tables, &c., at too great a distance from the hand, which, when unemployed, must be ranged along the sides of the room. Utility therefore requires a large room to be a parallelogram. This figure is likewise best calculated for the admission of light; because, to avoid crosslights, all the windows ought to be in one wall; and if the opposite wall be at such a distance as not to be fully lighted, the room must be obscure. The height of a room exceeding nine or ten feet, has little relation to utility; therefore proportion is the only rule for determining the height, when above that number of feet.\n\nArtists who deal in the beautiful, love to entertain the eye; palaces and sumptuous buildings, in which intrinsic beauty may be fully displayed, give them an opportunity of exerting their taste. But such a propensity is peculiarly unhappy with regard to private dwelling-houses; because in these, relative beauty cannot be displayed to perfection, without hurting intrinsic beauty. There is no opportunity for great variety of form in a small house; and in edifices of this kind, internal convenience has not hitherto been happily adjusted to external regularity. Perhaps an accurate coincidence in this respect is beyond the reach of art. Architects, however, constantly split upon this rock; for they never can be persuaded to give over attempting to reconcile these two incompatibles:\n\nHow otherwise should it happen, that of the endless variety of private dwelling-houses, there should not be one found that is generally agreed upon as a good pattern? The unwearyed propensity to make a house regular as well as convenient, obliges the architect, in some articles, to sacrifice convenience to regularity, and, in others, regularity to convenience; and accordingly the house, which turns out neither regular nor convenient, never fails to displease.\n\nNothing can be more evident, than that the form of a dwelling-house ought to be suited to the climate; yet no error is more common than to copy in Britain the form of Italian houses, not forgetting even those parts that are purposely contrived for collecting air, and for excluding the sun: Winterset our colonnades and loggias, designed by the Italians to gather cool air, and exclude the beams of the sun, conveniences which the climate of this country does not require.\n\nWe shall next view architecture as one of the fine arts; which will lead us to the examination of such buildings, and parts of buildings, as are calculated solely to please the eye. Variety prevails in the works of nature; but art requires to be guided by rule and compass. Hence it is, that in such works of art as imitate nature, the great art is, to hide every appearance of art; which is done by avoiding regularity, and indulging variety. Put in works of art that are original and not imitative, such as architecture, strict regularity and uniformity ought to be studied, so far as consistent with utility.\n\nProportion is not less agreeable than regularity and uniformity; and therefore, in buildings intended to please the eye, they are all equally essential. It is taken for granted by many writers, that in all the parts of a building there are certain strict proportions which please the eye, in the same manner as in sound there are certain strict proportions which please the ear; and that, in both, the slightest deviation is equally disagreeable. Others seem to relish more a comparison between proportion in numbers, and proportion in quantity; and maintain, that the same proportions are agreeable in both. The proportions, for example, of the numbers 16, 24, and 36, are agreeable; and so, say they, are the proportions of a room, whose height is 16 feet, the breadth 24, and the length 36. But it ought to be considered, that there is no resemblance or relation between the objects of different senses. What pleases the ear in harmony, is not the proportion of the strings of the instrument, but of the sound which these strings produce. In architecture, on the contrary, it is the proportion of different quantities that pleases the eye, without the least relation to sound. The same thing may be said of numbers. Quantity is a real quality of every body; number is not a real quality, but merely an idea that arises upon viewing a plurality of things in succession. An arithmetical proportion is agreeable in numbers; but have we from this any reason to conclude, that it must also be agreeable in quantity? At this rate, a geometrical proportion, and many others, ought also to be agreeable in both. A certain proportion may coincide in quantity and number; and amongst an endless variety of proportions, it would be wonderful if there never should be an coincidence.\ncoincidence. One example is given of this coincidence, in the numbers 16, 24, and 36; but to be convinced that it is merely accidental, we need but reflect, that the same proportions are not applicable to the external figure of a house, and far less to a column.\n\nIt is ludicrous to observe writers acknowledging the necessity of accurate proportions, and yet differing widely about them. Laying aside reasoning and philosophy, one fact universally agreed on ought to have undeceived them, that the same proportions which please in a model are not agreeable in a large building: A room 48 feet in length, and 24 in breadth and height, is well proportioned; but a room 12 feet wide and high, and 24 long, approaches to a gallery.\n\nPerrault, in his comparison of the ancients and moderns, goes to the opposite extreme, maintaining, that the different proportions assigned to each order of columns are arbitrary, and that the beauty of these proportions is entirely the effect of custom. But he should have considered, that if these proportions had not originally been agreeable, they could never have been established by custom.\n\nFor illustrating this point, we shall add a few examples of the agreeableness of different proportions. In a sumptuous edifice, the capital rooms ought to be large, otherwise they will not be proportioned to the size of the building; for the same reason, a very large room is improper in a small house. But in things thus related, the mind requires not a precise or single proportion, rejecting all others; on the contrary, many different proportions are equally agreeable. It is only when a proportion becomes loose and distant, that the agreeableness abates, and at last vanishes. Accordingly, in buildings, rooms of different proportions are found to be equally agreeable, even where the proportion is not influenced by utility. With regard to the proportion the height of a room should bear to the length and breadth, it must be extremely arbitrary, considering the uncertainty of the eye as to the height of a room when it exceeds 16 or 17 feet. In columns, again, every architect must confess, that the proportion of height and thickness varies between 8 diameters and 10, and that every proportion between these two extremes is agreeable. Besides, there must certainly be a further variation of proportion, depending on the size of the column: A row of columns 10 feet high, and a row twice that height, requires different proportions: The intercolumniations must also differ in proportion according to the height of the row.\n\nProportion of parts is not only itself a beauty, but is inseparably connected with a beauty of the highest relish, that of concord and harmony; which will be plain from what follows: A room, the parts of which are all finely adjusted to each other, strikes us not only with the beauty of proportion, but with a pleasure far superior. The length, the breadth, the height, the windows, raise each of them a separate emotion: These emotions are similar; and, though faint when separately felt, they produce, in conjunction, the emotion of concord or harmony, which is very pleasant. On the other hand, where the length of a room far exceeds the breadth, the mind, comparing together parts so intimately connected, immediately perceives a disagreement or disproportion which disgusts. Hence a long gallery, however convenient for exercise, is not an agreeable figure of a room.\n\nIn buildings defined chiefly or solely to please the eye, regularity and proportion are essentially necessary, because they are the means of producing intrinsic beauty. But a skilful artist will not confine his view to regularity and proportion; he will also study congruity, which is perceived when the form and ornaments of a structure are suited to the purpose for which it is appointed. Hence every building ought to have an expression suited to its destination. A palace ought to be sumptuous and grand; a private dwelling, neat and modest; a playhouse, gay and splendid; and a monument, gloomy and melancholy. A heathen temple has a double definition: It is considered as a house dedicated to some divinity; therefore it ought to be grand, elevated, and magnificent; It is also considered as a place of worship; and therefore ought to be somewhat dark and gloomy, because dimness or obscurity produces that tone of mind which is favourable to humility and devotion. Columns, besides their chief definition of being supports, contribute to that peculiar expression which the destination of a building requires: Columns of different proportions serve to express loftiness, lightness, &c., as well as strength. Situation may also contribute to expression: Convenience regulates the situation of a private dwelling-house; and the situation of a palace ought to be lofty. This leads to a question, Whether the situation, where there happens to be no choice, ought, in any measure, to regulate the form of the edifice? The connection between a great house and a neighbouring field, though not extremely intimate, demands however some congruity. It would, for example, displease us to find an elegant building thrown away upon a wild uncultivated country: Congruity requires a polished field for such a building. The old Gothic form of building was well suited to the rough uncultivated regions where it was invented; but was very ill adapted to the fine plains of France and Italy.\n\nThe external structure of a house leads naturally to its internal structure. A large and spacious room, which is the first that commonly receives us, is a bad contrivance in several respects. In the first place, when immediately from the open air we step into such a room, its size in appearance is diminished by contrast; it looks little, compared with the great canopy of the sky. In the next place, when it recovers its grandeur, as it soon doth, it gives a diminutive appearance to the rest of the house; paling from it, every apartment looks little. In the third place, by its situation it serves only for a waiting-room, and a passage to the principal apartments. Rejecting therefore this form, a hint may be taken from the climax in writing for another that appears more suitable: A handsome portico, proportioned to the size and fashion of the front, leads into a waiting-room of a larger size, and this to the great room, all by a progression from small to great.\n\nGrandeur is the principal emotion that architecture is capable of raising in the mind: it might therefore be the chief study of the artist, in great buildings destined\nto please the eye. But as grandeur depends partly on size, it is unlucky for architecture that it is governed by regularity and proportion, which never deceive the eye by making objects appear larger than they are in reality. But though regularity and proportion contribute nothing to grandeur, so far as that emotion depends on size; yet they contribute greatly to it by confining the size within such bounds that it can be taken in and examined at one view; for, when objects are so large as not to be comprehended but in parts, they tend rather to distract than satisfy the mind.\n\nWe shall next pass to such ornaments as contribute to give buildings a peculiar expression. It has been doubted, whether a building can regularly admit any ornament but what is useful, or at least has that appearance. But, considering the double aim of architecture as a fine, as well as an useful art, there is no reason why ornaments may not be added to please the eye, without any relation to utility. A private dwelling-house, it is true, and other edifices, where use is the chief aim, admit not regularly any ornament but what has at least the appearance of use: But temples, triumphal arches, and other buildings intended chiefly or solely for show, may be highly ornamented.\n\nThis suggests a division of ornaments into three kinds, viz. 1. Ornaments that are beautiful without relation to use; such as statues, vases, basso or alto relievo: 2. Things in themselves not beautiful, but possessing the beauty of utility, by imposing on the spectator, and appearing to be useful; such as blind windows: 3. Where things are beautiful in themselves, and at the same time take on the appearance of use; such as pilasters.\n\nWith regard to the first, we naturally require that a statue be so placed, as to be seen in every direction, and examined at different distances. Statues, therefore, are properly introduced to adorn the great stair that leads to the principal door of a palace, or to lessen the void between pillars. But a niche in the external front is an improper place for a statue. There is an additional reason against placing them upon the roof or top of the walls; their rickety situation gives pain, as they have the appearance of being in danger of tumbling down; besides, we are inclined to feel from their being too much exposed to the inclemencies of the weather. To adorn the top of the wall with a row of vases, is an unhappy conceit, by placing a thing whose natural definition is utility, where it cannot have even the appearance of use. As to carvings upon the external surface of a building, termed basso relievo when flat, and alto relievo when prominent, all contradictory expressions ought to be avoided. Now, firmness and solidity being the proper expressions of a pedestal, and, on the contrary, lightness and delicacy of carved work, the pedestal, whether of a column or of a statue, ought to be sparingly ornamented. The ancients never ventured any bolder ornament than the basso relievo.\n\nWith respect to ornaments of the second kind, it is a great blunder to contrive them so as to make them appear useless. A blind window, therefore, when necessary for regularity, ought to be so disguised as to appear a real window: When it appears without disguise, it is disgustful, as a vain attempt to supply the want of invention; it shows the irregularity in a stronger light, by signifying that a window ought to be there in point of regularity, but that the architect had not skill sufficient to connect external regularity with internal convenience.\n\nAs to the third, it is an error to sink pilasters so far into the wall, as to remove totally, or mostly, the appearance of use. They should always project so much from the wall, as to have the appearance of supporting the entablature over them.\n\nFrom ornaments in general, we descend to a pillar, the chief ornament in great buildings. The destination of a pillar is to support, really or in appearance, another part termed the entablature. With regard to the form of a pillar, it must be observed, that a circle is a more agreeable figure than a square, a globe than a cube, and a cylinder than a parallelopipedon. This last, in the language of architecture, is saying, that a column is a more agreeable figure than a pilaster; and for that reason it ought to be preferred, when all other circumstances are equal. Another reason concurs, that a column annexed to a wall, which is a plain surface, makes a greater variety than a pilaster. Besides, pilasters at a distance are apt to be mistaken for pillars; and the spectator is disappointed when, on a nearer approach, he discovers them to be only pilasters.\n\nAs to the parts of a column, a bare uniform cylinder, without a capital, appears naked; and without a base, appears too ticklishly placed to stand firm. It ought therefore to have some finishing at the top and bottom: Hence the three chief parts of a column, the shaft, the base, and the capital. Nature undoubtedly requires proportion among these parts, but it admits of variety of proportion. Vitruvius and some of the elder writers seem to think, that the proportions of columns were derived from the human figure, the capital representing the head, the base the feet, and the shaft the body. The Tuscan has been accordingly denominated the Cigantic; the Doric, the Herculean; the Ionic, the Ma-trional; and the Corinthian, the Virginal:\u2014the Composite is a mixture of the Corinthian and Ionic. As to the base, the principle of utility interposes to vary it from the human figure, and to proportion it so to the whole, as to give the column the appearance of stability.\n\nAmong the Greeks, we find only three orders of columns, the Doric, the Ionic, and the Corinthian, distinguished from each other by their destination as well as by their ornaments. It has been disputed, whether any new order can be added to these: Some hold the affirmative, and give for instances the Tuscan and Composite; others maintain, that these properly are not distinct orders, but only the original orders with some slight variation. The only circumstances that can serve to distinguish one order from another, are the form of the column, and its destination. To make the first a distinguishing mark without regard to the other, would multiply orders without end. Destination is more limited, and it leads us to distinguish three kinds of orders; one plain and strong, for the purpose of supporting plain and massive buildings; one delicate and graceful, for supporting buildings of that character; and between these, a\nthird, supporting buildings of a mixed nature. So that, if distinction alone is to be regarded, the Tuscan is of the same order with the Doric, and the Composite with the Corinthian.\n\nThe ornaments of these three orders ought to be suited to the purposes for which they are intended. Plain and rustic ornaments would be not a little discordant with the elegance of the Corinthian order, and sweet and delicate ornaments not less with the strength of the Doric.\n\nWith respect to buildings of every kind, one rule, dictated by utility, is, that they be firm and stable. Another, dictated by beauty, is, that they also appear so to the eye; for everything that appears tottering, and in hazard of tumbling down, produceth in the spectator the painful emotion of fear, instead of the pleasing emotion of beauty; and accordingly it should be the great care of the artist, that every part of his edifice appear to be well supported. Some have introduced a kind of conceit in architecture, by giving parts of buildings the appearance of falling; of this kind is the church of St Sophia in Constantinople; the round towers in the uppermost stories of Gothic buildings is in the same false taste.\n\nS E C T. II.\n\nOF ARCHITECTURE AS A MECHANICAL ART.\n\nOf the Origin of Buildings.\n\nBuildings, in the first ages of society, behoved to be extremely rude. The first huts were probably of a conic figure, being the most simple, and best adapted to the materials that could be obtained in such an unculivated state of society. These huts were formed of branches of trees, covered with reeds, leaves, and clay.\n\nBut, finding the conic figure inconvenient, on account of its inclined sides, they changed it into a cubical one, in the following manner: They fixed in the ground several upright trees to form the sides, filling the intervals between them with branches closely interwoven, and covered with clay. The sides being thus compleated, four large beams were placed on the upright trunks, which, being well joined at the angles, kept the sides firm; and likewise served to support the roof, which was composed of many joists, covered with reeds, leaves, and clay.\n\nAs men improved in the art of building, new methods of rendering their huts lasting and handsome were gradually invented. They took off the bark and other unevenesses from the trunks of the trees that formed the sides, and raised them above the dirt on stones. The spaces between the ends of the joists were closed with clay, and the ends of them were covered with thin boards, cut in the form of triglyphs, &c.\n\nFrom this simple construction the different orders of architecture took their rise. When buildings of wood were laid aside, they imitated, in their edifices of stone, the form which necessity had introduced into the primitive huts: Hence the upright trees gave rise to the columns; and the beams, joists, rafters, and strata of materials that formed the covering, suggested architraves, friezes, triglyphs, and cornices.\n\nAt what time, or by whom, the Grecian orders were invented, is not certainly known. But the following is the account which Vitruvius gives of them.\n\nDorus, king of Achaia, and son of Helenes and Opisca, built a temple to Juno in the ancient city of Argos, which happened to be in the manner now called Doric, from the name of the inventor. This manner was afterwards imitated in many other temples in the several cities of Achaia.\n\nThe Athenians, about the same time, sent thirteen colonies into Asia, under the command of Ion, son of Xuthus and Creusa. This Ion conquered all Caria, founded many cities, and called the country Ionia. The first temple he built was after the Doric manner. But afterwards he built a temple to Diana of a more delicate structure, and formed upon the proportions of a female body, as the Doric had been on those of a robust man. The capital was adorned with volutes, to represent the curls of a woman's hair; and flutings were cut on the shaft of the column, in imitation of the folds of her garment. This order got the name of Ionic, in honour of the Ionians who invented it.\n\nThe third sort of columns, called Corinthian, are said to owe their origin to the following accident:\u2014A young girl of Corinth having died, her nurse placed on her tomb a basket, containing certain trinkets, in which she delighted when alive, and covered it with a tyle to prevent the rain from spoiling them. The basket happened to be placed on a root of acanthus, which pushing out its leaves in the spring, covered the sides of the basket; some of the longest of which, being obstructed by the corners of the tyle, were forced downwards, and curled in the manner of volutes. Calimachus the sculptor, passing near the tomb, was so pleased with the beautiful appearance of the acanthus growing in this manner, that he imitated it in the columns which he afterwards made at Corinth.\n\nVillipandus treats this story of Calimachus as a fable, and maintains that the Corinthian capital took its origin from an order in Solomon's temple; and it must be acknowledged, that some descriptions in the Bible favour this opinion.\n\nBesides these three orders, said to be invented by the Greeks, two other, viz. the Tuscan and Composite, are thought to have been invented by the Romans. The Tuscan first appeared in Tuscany, before the Romans had any intercourse with the Greeks. The Composite is a mixture of the Ionic and Corinthian. These five manners of building, invented by the ancients, are called Orders, on account of the regularity and beauty of their forms.\nOf the Parts that compose an Order, and their Ornaments.\n\nThe parts that compose an order may be distributed into two different classes. In the first may be ranged all that have any analogy to the primitive huts, and represent some part that was necessary in their construction. Such are the shaft of the column, with the plinth of its base, and the abacus of its capital, representing the upright trees, with the stones on which they were placed, and those that covered them; likewise the architrave and triglyphs, representing the beams and joists; the mutules, modillions, or dentils, which all of them represent the rafters, or some other pieces of timber used to support the covering; and the cornice, representing the beds of materials that composed the covering. All these may properly be distinguished by the name of essential members. The subservient parts, contrived for the use or ornament of the former, and commonly called mouldings, may constitute the second class.\n\nThere are eight regular mouldings in ornamenting columns; the fillet, liflet, or square; the altragal, or bead; the torus, or tore; the scotia, mouth, or cymatium; the echinus, ovolo, or quarter-round; the inverted cyma, talon, or ogee; the cyma, cyma recta, or cymatium; the cavetto, or hollow. The names of these allude to their forms, and their forms are adapted to the purposes for which they are intended. See Plate XXVII.\n\nThe ovolo and talon, as they are strong at the extremities, are fit for supports; the cyma and cavetto, though improper for supports, serve for coverings to shelter other members; the torus and altragal, being shaped like ropes, are intended to bind and fortify the parts with which they are connected: But the use of the scotia and fillet, is only to separate and distinguish the other mouldings, to give a graceful turn to the profile, and to prevent the confusion which would arise from joining several curved members together.\n\nThere are various methods of describing the contours of mouldings; but the simplest and best is to form them of quadrants of circles, as in Plate XXVII.\n\nAn assemblage of what are called essential parts and mouldings, is termed a profile. The most perfect profiles are such as are composed of few mouldings, varied in form and size; and so disposed, that the straight and curved ones succeed each other alternately. When ornaments are employed in mouldings, some of them should be left plain, in order to give a proper repose: For, when all are ornamented, the figure of the profile is lost.\n\nOf the Orders of Architecture.\n\nAn Order consists of two principal members, the Column and the Entablature; each of which is composed of three principal parts. Those of the Column are, the Base, the Shaft, and the Capital; and those of the Entablature are, the Architrave, the Frieze, and the Cornice. All these are subdivided into many lesser parts, whose number, form, and dimensions characterize each order, and express the degree of strength, delicacy, richness, or simplicity peculiar to it.\n\n1. Of the Tuscan.\n\nThe Tuscan (Plate XXIV.) is the most solid and simple of all the orders. It is composed of few parts, devoid of ornaments, and so massive, that its seems capable of supporting the heaviest burden. There are no remains of a regular Tuscan order among the antiques; the doctrine of Vitruvius concerning it is obscure; and the profiles of Palladio, Scamozzi, Serlio, de l'Orme, and Vignola, are all imperfect.\n\nThe height of the Tuscan column is 14 modules, or semidiameters, each consisting of 30 minutes; and that of the whole entablature 3\u00bd modules; which being divided into 10 equal parts, three of them are for the height of the architrave, three for the freeze, and the remaining four for the cornice: The capital is one module; the base, including the lower cincture of the shaft, is likewise one module; and the shaft, with its upper cincture and altragal, 12 modules.\n\nThese are the general dimensions of the order; the particular dimensions may be learned by inspection of the Plates.\n\nIn the remains of antiquity, the quantity of diminution at the top of the Tuscan column is various; but seldom less than one eighth, nor more than one sixth of the inferior diameter of the column. The last of these is generally preferred; and Chalmers and others make the same diminution in all columns, without regard to their order.\n\n2. Of the Doric Order.\n\nThe Doric Order, (Plate XXV.) is next in strength to the Tuscan; and being of a grave, robust, and masculine aspect, is by Scamozzi called the Herculean. As it is the most ancient of all the orders, it retains more of the structure of the primitive huts than any of the rest; the triglyphs in its freeze representing the ends of the joists; and the mutules in its cornice, representing the rafters.\n\nThe height of the Doric column, including its capital and base, is 16 modules, and the height of the entablature four; the latter of which being divided into eight parts, two of them are for the architrave, three for the frieze, and three for the cornice.\n\nIn most of the antiques, the Doric column is executed without a base. Vitruvius likewise makes it without one; the base, according to him, having been first employed in the Ionic order, in imitation of the sandal of a woman's foot. Scamozzi blames this practice, and most of the modern architects are of his opinion.\n\nIn the profile of the theatre of Marcellus, the frieze is enriched with husks and roses; the architrave consists only of one fascia and a fillet; the drops are conical; the metope is enriched with a bull's skull, adorned with a garland of beads, in imitation of those on the temple of Jupiter Tonans at the foot of the Capitol. In some antique fragments, and in a great many modern buildings, the metopes are alternately adorned with ox-skulls and pateras. But they may be filled with any other ornaments, according to the destination of the building.","sp":400,"ep":405},{"h":"OF BALLUSTRADES","t":"Ballustrades are sometimes of real use in buildings; and at other times they are only ornamental. Such as are intended for use, as when they are employed in stair-cases, before windows, or to inclose terraces, &c., must always be nearly of the same height; never exceeding three feet and a half, nor ever less than three. But those that are principally designed for ornament, as when they finish a building, should be proportioned to the architecture they accompany; and their height ought never to exceed four fifths of the height of the entablature on which they are placed; nor should it ever be less than two thirds thereof, without counting the zoccolo, or plinth, the height of which must be sufficient to leave the whole ballustrade exposed to view.\n\nThe best proportion for ballustrades is to divide the whole given height into thirteen equal parts; eight of these for the height of the balluster, three for the base, and two for the cornice or rail; or into fourteen, (if it be required to make the balluster less), giving eight parts to the balluster, four to the base, and two to the rail. One of these parts may be called a module; and, being divided into nine minutes, may serve to determine the dimensions of the particular members.\n\nIn ballustrades, the distance between two ballusters should not exceed half the diameter of the balluster measured in its thickest part, nor be less than one third of it.\n\nThe breadth of the pedestals, when they are placed on columns or pilasters, is regulated by them; the dye never being made broader than the top of the shaft, nor much narrower: and when there are neither columns nor pilasters in the front, the dye should not be much lower than a square, and seldom higher. On stairs, or any other inclined planes, the same proportions are to be observed as on horizontal ones.","sp":422,"ep":422},{"h":"OF BASEMENTS AND ATTICS","t":"Instead of employing several orders one above the other in a composition, the ground-floor is sometimes made in the form of a basement, on which the order that decorates the principal story is placed. The proportion of these basements is not fixed, but depends on the nature of the rooms on the ground-floor. In the palace of the Porti in Vicenza, the height of the basement is equal to that of the order. In some buildings, its height exceeds two thirds of that of the order; and in others only half the height of the order. It is not, however, advisable to make the basement higher than the order it supports; neither should it be lower than one half of the order.\n\nThe usual method of decorating basements is with rustics of different kinds. The best, where neatness and finishing is aimed at, are such as have a smooth surface. Their height, including the joint, should never be less, nor much more, than half a module of the order placed on the basement. Their figure may be from a square to a sesquialtera; and their joints may be either square or chamfered. The square ones should not be broader than one eighth of the height of the rustic, nor narrower than one tenth; and their depth must be equal to their breadth; those that are chamfered, must form a rectangle; and the breadth\nbreadth of the whole joint may be from one fourth to one third of the height of the flat surface of the rustic.\n\nInstead of a second order, it is sometimes usual to crown the first with an Attic Story: These Attics should never exceed in height one third of the height of the order on which they are placed, nor be less than one quarter of it. Their figure is that of a pedestal: The base, dye, and cornice, of which they are composed, may bear the same proportions to each other as those of pedestals do; and the base and cornice may be composed of the same mouldings as those of pedestals. Sometimes the Attic is continued throughout; at others, it projects, and forms a pilaster over each column of the order. The breadth of this pilaster is seldom made narrower than the upper diameter of the column below it, and never broader. Its projection may be equal to one quarter of its breadth.","sp":421,"ep":422},{"h":"OF CEILINGS","t":"Ceilings are either flat, or coved, in different manners. The simplest of the flat kind are those adorned with large compartments, surrounded with one or several mouldings, either let into the ceiling, or projecting beyond its surface: And when the mouldings that form the compartments are enriched, and some of the compartments adorned with well-executed ornaments, such ceilings have a good effect, and are very proper for common dwelling-houses, and all low apartments. Their ornaments and mouldings do not require a bold relief; but, being near the eye, they must be finished with taste and neatness. For higher rooms, a flat ceiling which has the appearance of being composed of various joints framed into each other, and forming compartments of various geometrical figures, should be employed. The sides of the joints forming the compartments are generally adorned with mouldings, and represent either a simple architrave, or an architrave-cornice, according to the size of the compartments and the height of the room.\n\nCoved ceilings are more expensive; but they are likewise more beautiful. They are used promiscuously in large and small rooms, and occupy from one fifth to one third of the height of the room. If the room be low in proportion to its breadth, the cove must likewise be low; and when it is high, the cove must be so likewise: By which means the excess of the height will be rendered less perceptible. But, where the architect is at liberty to proportion the height of the room to its superficial dimensions, the most eligible proportion for the cove is one fourth of the whole height. In parallelogram-figured rooms, the middle of the ceiling is generally formed into a large flat panel. This panel, with the border that surrounds it, may occupy from one half to three fifths of the breadth of the room. The figure of the cove is commonly either a quadrant of a circle or of an ellipse, taking its rise a little above the cornice, and finishing at the border round the great panel in the centre. The border projects somewhat beyond the coves on the outside.\nside; and, on the side towards the pannel, it is generally made of a sufficient depth to admit the ornaments of an architrave, or architrave and cornice.\n\nIn Britain, circular rooms are not much in use; but they are very beautiful. Their height must be the same with that of square rooms; their ceilings may be flat; but they are handsomer when coved, or of a concave form.\n\nArcs doubleaux, or soffits of arches, when narrow, are ornamented with guillochis, or frets; but, when broad, they may be adorned in a different manner.\n\nWhen the profiles of the room are gilt, the ceilings ought likewise to be gilt. The usual method is to gild all the ornaments, and to leave the grounds white, pearl colour, light blue, or of any other tint proper to set off the gilding to advantage. Painted ceilings, so common in France and Italy, are but little used in Britain.","sp":441,"ep":442},{"h":"OF CHIMNEY-PIECES","t":"Among the ancients, there are very few examples of chimney-pieces to be met with. Neither the Italians nor French have excelled in compositions of this kind. Britain, by being possessed of many able sculptors at different\ndifferent times, has surpassed all other nations, both in taste of design, and workmanship.\n\nThe size of the chimney must be regulated by the dimensions of the room where it is placed. In the smallest apartments, the breadth of the aperture should never be less than three feet, to three feet six inches. In rooms from 20 to 24 feet square, or of equal superficial dimensions, it may be from 4 to $4\\frac{1}{2}$ feet broad; in those of 24 to 27, from $4\\frac{1}{2}$ to 5; and, in such as exceed these dimensions, the aperture may even be extended to $5\\frac{1}{2}$ or 6 feet.\n\nThe chimney should always be situate so as to be immediately seen by those who enter the room. The middle of the partition wall is the most proper place in halls, salons, and other rooms of passage; but in drawing-rooms, dressing-rooms, and the like, the middle of the back wall is the best situation. In bed-rooms, the chimney is always in the middle of one of the partition-walls; and in closets, and other very small places, to save room, it is put in a corner. Where-ever two chimneys are used in the same room, they should be placed either directly facing each other, if in different walls, or at equal distances from the centre of the wall in which they both are.\n\nThe proportion of the apertures of chimney-pieces of a moderate size is generally a perfect square; in small ones, it is a trifle higher; and in large ones, a trifle lower. Their ornaments consist in architraves, friezes, cornices, columns, pilasters, terminals, caryatides, consoles, and all kinds of ornaments of sculpture, representing animals and vegetables, &c., likewise vases, chalices, trophies of arms, &c. In designing them, regard must be had to the nature of the place where they are to be employed. Such as are intended for halls, salons, guard-rooms, galleries, and other large places, must be composed of large parts, few in number, of distinct and simple forms, and having a bold relief; but chimney-pieces for drawing-rooms, dressing-rooms, &c., may be of a more delicate and complicated nature.\n\nChimney-pieces are composed of wood, stone, or marble; the last of which ought to be preferred, as figures or profiles are best represented in a pure white.\n\nPlate XXXIII. Fig. 1, 2, 3, and 4, are different designs for chimney-pieces by Palladio and Inigo Jones. Their proportion may be gathered from the designs, which are accurately executed.","sp":440,"ep":441},{"h":"OF GATES","t":"DOORS, AND PIERS.\n\nThere are two kinds of entrances, viz., doors and gates. The former serve only for the passage of persons on foot; but the latter likewise admit horsemen and carriages. Doors are used as entrances to churches, and other public buildings, to common dwelling-houses, and apartments: And gates serve for inlets to cities, fortresses, parks, gardens, palaces, &c. The apertures of gates being always wide, they are generally made in the form of an arch, that figure being the strongest. But doors, which are generally of small dimensions, are commonly parallelograms, and closed horizontally.\n\nThe general proportion for the apertures, both of gates and doors, whether arched or square, is, that the height be about double the breadth.\n\nThe usual ornaments of gates consist of columns, pilasters, entablatures, pediments, rustics of different kinds, impots, archivolts, &c.; and the most common method of adorning doors is with an architrave, for rounding\nthe sides and top of the aperture, on which are placed a regular frieze and cornice. Sometimes the cornice is supported by a couple of consoles placed on each side of the door; and sometimes, besides an architrave, the aperture is adorned with columns, pilasters, caryatides, or termini; and a regular entablature with a pediment.\n\nInside-doors, however small the building may be, should never be narrower than two feet nine inches; nor should they ever, in private houses, exceed three feet six inches in breadth, which is more than sufficient to admit the bulkiest person. Their height should at least be six feet three or four inches; otherwise a tall person cannot pass without stooping. In churches, palaces, &c., where there is a constant ingress and egress of people, the apertures must be larger. The smallest breadth that can be given to a gate is $8\\frac{1}{2}$ or 9 feet, which is but just sufficient for the passage of a coach.\n\nPlate XXXI. Fig. 1. Is a rustic door, composed by the celebrated Vignola, in which the aperture occupies two thirds of the whole height, and one half of the whole breadth; the figure of it being a double square. The rustics may be either smooth or hatched; their joints must form a rectangle, and the breadth of each joint may be one third, or two sevenths, of the vertical surface of a rustic. The joints of the claveaux, or key-stones, must be drawn to the summit of an equilateral triangle, whose base is the top of the aperture. The architrave surrounding the aperture may be composed either of a large ogee and fillet, or of a plat-band and fillet. Its whole breadth must be one tenth of the breadth of the aperture; the remaining part of each pier being for the rustics. The entablature is Tuscan: The cornice is to be one fifteenth of the whole height of the door; and what remains below it being divided into twenty-one equal parts, the two uppermost of them will be for the frieze and architrave, and the remaining nineteen for the rustics and plinth at the foot of the door.\n\nFig. 2. Is a disposition of Michael Angelo's. The windows of the Capitol at Rome are of this kind; and Sir Christopher Wren hath executed doors of the same kind under the semicircular porches in the flanks of St Paul's. The figure of the aperture may be a double square; the architrave one sixth of the breadth of the aperture; and the whole entablature one quarter of its height. The front of the pilasters or columns, on each side, must be on a line with the fascia of the architrave; and their breadth must be a demi-diameter.\n\nFig. 3. Is likewise a design of Vignola's. It is of the Corinthian order, and executed in the Cancellaria at Rome. The height is equal to double its breadth; and the whole ornament at the top is equal to one third of the height of the aperture. The architrave is in breadth one fifth of the breadth of the aperture; and the pilasters that support the consoles, are half as broad as the architrave. The whole is well imagined, but rather heavy; and it will be best to reduce the architrave to one sixth of the aperture, diminishing the entablature proportionally.\n\nFig. 4. Is a design of Serlio's. The aperture may be either twice as high as broad, or a trifle less. The diameter of the columns may be equal to one quarter of the breadth of the aperture; and their height may be from eight diameters to eight and a half. The entablature must be somewhat less than one quarter of the height of the columns; and the height of the pediment may be one quarter of its base.\n\nFig. 5. Is a door in the salon of the Farnese at Rome, designed by Vignola. The aperture forms a double square. The entablature is equal to three sevenths of its height, the architrave being one of these sevenths; and the whole ornament on the sides, consisting of the architrave and pilasters, is equal to two sevenths of the breadth of the aperture: The cornice is Composite, enriched with mutules and dentils; and the frieze is adorned with a festoon of laurel.\n\nFig. 6. Is copied from a door at Florence, said to be a design of Cigoli's. The height of the aperture is a trifle more than twice its breadth. It is arched; and the impost is equal to half a diameter. The columns are Ionic, somewhat above nine diameters high; and their shafts are garnished each with five rustic cinquefoils. The entablature is less than one quarter of the column; and the breadth of the tablet, in which there is an inscription, is equal to the breadth of the aperture.","sp":422,"ep":439},{"h":"OF INTERCOLUMNNIATIONS","t":"Columns are either engaged, or insulated; and, when insulated, are either very near the wall, or at a considerable distance from it. Engaged columns, or such as are near the walls of a building, are not limited in their intercolumnniations, as these depend on the breadths of the arches, windows, niches, or other decorations placed between the columns. But columns that are entirely detached, and perform alone the office of supporting the entablature, as in peristyles, porches, and galleries, must be near each other, for the sake both of real and apparent solidity.\n\nThe intercolumnniations among the ancients were various. Those used in the Ionic and Corinthian orders were the pycnothytle, of which the interval was equal to one diameter and a half of the column; the sylytle, whose interval was equal to two diameters; the eustyle, to two and a quarter; the diastyle to three, and the araeothytle to four. In the Doric order, they used other intercolumnniations, regulating them by the triglyphs, one of which was always placed directly over the middle of each column; so that they were either sylytle, monotriglyph, of one diameter and a half; diastyle, of two diameters and three quarters; or araeothytle, of four diameters; and the Tuscan intervals were very wide, some of them being above seven diameters, which was very practicable, as the architraves were of wood.\n\nAmong these different intercolumnniations, the pycnothytle and sylytle are too narrow; for although the ancients made frequent use of them, that ought rather to be ascribed to necessity than choice. For, as the architraves were composed of single stones, extending from the middle of one column to the middle of another, it would have been difficult, especially in large buildings, to find blocks of a sufficient length for diastyle intervals. With regard to the araeothytle and Tuscan intercolumnniations, they are by much too wide, and can only be used in rustic buildings, where the architraves are of wood; neither is the diastyle sufficiently solid in large compositions. The eustyle is a medium between the narrow and broad intervals; and, being at the same time both spacious and solid, hath been preferred to any of the rest by the ancients as well as the moderns.\n\nVignola observed nearly the same proportion in all his intercolumnniations; which practice, though condemned by several writers, is certainly preferable to any other; as it preserves the character of each order, and maintains in all of them an equal degree of real solidity. Setting aside therefore the pycnothytle and sylytle dispositions on account of their want of space, and the araeothytle for its deficiency in point of strength, it may be established, that the diastyle and eustyle intercolumnniations, (the latter of which, on most occasions, ought to have the preference), may be employed in all the orders without distinction, excepting the Doric; in which the most perfect interval is triglyph; neither the monotriglyph, nor the araeothytle, being to be suffered but in cases of necessity.\n\nSometimes, on account of the windows, doors, niches, and other decorations, which correspond with the intercolumnniations of the peristyle, or gallery, it is not possible to make the intervals so narrow as eustyle, or even as diastyle: Wherefore, the moderns, authorized by some few examples of the ancients, where grouped columns are employed, have invented a manner of disposing them, called by Perraults araeothytle, which admits of a larger interval, without any detriment to the apparent solidity of the building. This kind of disposition is composed of two sylytle intercolumnniations; the column that separates them being approached towards one of those at the extremities, sufficient room only being left between them for the projection of the capitals; so that the great space is three diameters and a half wide, and the little one half a diameter.\n\nIn peristyles, galleries, or porticos, all the intercolumnniations must be equal: But in a logia, or porch, the middle interval may be broader than the others, by a triglyph or modillion, or three or four dentils; unless the columns at the angles be coupled, or grouped with pilasters; in which case, all the intervals should be of the same dimensions.\n\nWhen buildings are very small, as is frequently the case in temples and other inventions used for ornamenting gardens, the intercolumnniations may be broader, in proportion to the diameter of the columns, than usual; because,\ncauses, when they are nearer each other than three feet, there is hardly room for a bulky person to pass between them.","sp":420,"ep":421},{"h":"OF NICHES AND STATUES","t":"It hath been customary, in all ages, to enrich different parts of buildings with representations of the human body. Thus the ancients adorned their temples, baths, theatres, &c., with statues of their deities, heroes, and legislators. The moderns still preserve the same custom, placing in their churches, palaces, &c., statues of illustrious persons, and even groups composed of various figures, representing occurrences collected from history, fables, &c. Sometimes these statues or groups are detached, raised on pedestals, and placed contiguous to the walls of a building, or in the middle of a room, court, or public square. But they are most frequently placed in cavities made in the walls, called niches. Of these there are two sorts; the one formed like an arch in its elevation, and semicircular or semieliptical in its plan; the other is a parallelogram both in its plan and elevation.\n\nThe proportion of both these niches depends on the character of the statues, or the general form of the groups placed in them. The lowest are at least a double square in height; and the highest never exceed 2\u00bd of their breadth.\n\nWith regard to the manner of decorating them, when they are alone in a composition, they are generally inclosed in a panel, formed and proportioned like the aperture of a window, and adorned in the same manner. In this case, the niche is carried quite down to the bottom; but on the sides and at the top, a small space is left between the niche and the architrave of the panel. And when niches are intermixed with windows, they may be adorned in the same manner with the windows, provided the ornaments be of the same figure and dimensions with those of the windows.\n\nThe size of the statues depends on the dimensions of the niches. They should neither be so large as to have the appearance of being rammed into the niches, as in Santa Maria Maggiore at Rome; nor so narrow as to seem lost in them, as in the Pantheon. The distance between the outline of the statue and side of the niche should never be less than one third of a head, nor more than one half, whether the niche be square or arched; and when it is square, the distance from the top of the head to the ceiling of the niche should not be greater than the distance on the sides. Statues are generally raised on a plinth, the height of which may be from one third to one half of a head; and sometimes, where the niches are large, the statues may be raised on small pedestals.\n\nThe character of the statue should always correspond with the character of the architecture with which it is surrounded. Thus, if the order be Doric, Hercules, Jupiter, Mars, Esculapius, and all male statues representing beings of a robust and grave nature, may be introduced; if Ionic, then Apollo, Bacchus, &c.; and if Corinthian, Venus, Flora, and others of a delicate nature, should be employed.","sp":440,"ep":440},{"h":"OF ORDERS ABOVE ORDERS","t":"When, in a building, two or more orders are employed, one above another, the laws of solidity require, the strongest should be placed lowest. Hence the Tuscan must support the Doric, the Doric the Ionic, the Ionic the Composite or Corinthian, and the Composite the Corinthian.\n\nThis rule, however, is not always strictly adhered to. Most authors place the Composite above the Corinthian. There are likewise examples where the same order is repeated, as in the theatre of Statilius Taurus, and the Coliseum; and others, where an intermediate order is omitted, and the Ionic placed on the Tuscan, or the Corinthian on the Doric. But none of these practices ought to be imitated.\n\nIn placing columns above one another, the axis of all the columns ought to correspond, or be in the same perpendicular line, at least in front.\n\nWith regard to the proportions of columns placed above each other, Scamozzi's rule, That the lower diameter of the superior column should constantly be equal to the upper diameter of the inferior one, is universally esteemed the best, and gives all the columns the appearance of one long tapering tree, cut into several pieces. According to this rule, the Doric column will be to the Tuscan, as $13\\frac{1}{2}$ to 14; the Ionic to the Doric, as 15 to 16; the Composite or Corinthian to the Ionic, as $16\\frac{1}{2}$ to 18; and the Corinthian to the Composite, as $16\\frac{1}{2}$ to 20.\n\nIn Britain there are few examples of more than two stories of columns in the same aspect: And, though in Italy, and other parts of Europe, we frequently meet with three, and sometimes more; yet it is a practice by no means to be imitated; for there is no possibility of avoiding many striking inconsistencies, or of preserving the character of each order in its intercolumnial decorations.","sp":421,"ep":421},{"h":"OF PEDESTALS","t":"Most writers consider the pedestal as a necessary part of the order, without which it is not complete. It is indeed a matter of little importance whether it be considered in that light, or as a distinct composition: We shall therefore treat of a pedestal as a distinct body, having no more connection with the order than an Attic, a base, or any other part with which it may on some occasions be associated.\n\nA pedestal consists of three principal parts; the base, the dye, and the cornice. The dye is always nearly of the same figure; being constantly either a cube or a parallelopipedon: But the base and cornice are varied and adorned with more or fewer mouldings, according to the simplicity or richness of the composition in which the pedestal is employed. Hence pedestals are, like columns, distinguished by the names of Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite.\n\nSome authors are adverse to pedestals, and compare a column raised on a pedestal to a man mounted on stilts; imagining that they were introduced merely from necessity, and for want of columns of a sufficient length. It is indeed true, that the ancients often made use of artifices to lengthen their columns; as appears by some that are in the Baptistery of Constantine at Rome; the shafts of which being too short for the building, were lengthened and joined to their bases by an undulated sweep, adorned with acanthus leaves. Nevertheless, there are many occasions where pedestals are evidently necessary; and some in which the order, were it not so raised, would lose\nJose much of its beautiful appearance. Thus, in the insides of churches, if the columns that support the vault were placed immediately on the ground, the seats would hide their bases, and a good part of their shafts; and, in the theatres of the ancients, if the columns of the scene had been placed immediately on the stage, the actors would have hid a part of them from the audience. In interior decorations, a pedestal diminishes the parts of the order, which otherwise might perhaps appear too clumsy, and hath the advantage of placing the column in a more favourable view, by raising its base nearer the level of the spectator's eye. In a second order of arcades, there is no avoiding pedestals; as without them it is impossible to give the arches any tolerable proportion.\n\nWith regard to the proportion that pedestals ought to bear to that of the columns they support, it is by no means fixed. Both the ancients and moderns vary greatly on this head. Vignola's proportions are generally reckoned the best. He makes his pedestals, in all the orders, of the same height, viz. one third of the column; and as their breadth of course increases or diminishes in the same degree as the diameters of their respective columns do, the character of the order is always preserved, which, according to any other method, is impossible.\n\nAs to the divisions of the pedestal; if the whole height be divided into nine parts, one of them may be given to the height of the cornice, two to the base, and the six remaining to the dye. The breadth of the dye is always made equal to that of the plinth of the column. The projection of the cornice may be made equal to its height; and the base being divided into three parts, two of them will be for the height of the plinth, and one for the mouldings, whose projection must be less than that of the cornice. These measures are common to all pedestals. See Plate XXX.","sp":419,"ep":420},{"h":"OF PEDIMENTS","t":"Pediments most probably owe their origin to the inclined roofs of the primitive huts. Among the Romans, they were used only as coverings to their sacred buildings, till Caesar obtained leave to cover his house with a pointed roof, after the manner of temples. In the remains of antiquity we meet with two kinds of pediments, the triangular and circular. The former of these are promiscuously applied to cover small or large bodies: But the latter being of a heavier figure, are never used but as coverings to doors, niches, windows, or gates.\n\nAs a pediment represents the roof, it should never be employed but as a finishing to the whole composition.\n\nThe ancients introduced but few pediments into their buildings, usually contenting themselves with a single one to adorn the middle or principal part. But some of the moderns, and particularly the Italians, have been so immoderately fond of them, that their buildings frequently consist of almost nothing else.\n\nThe girdle, being a necessary part in the construction of a roof, it is an impropriety to intermit the horizontal entablature of a pediment, by which it is represented, to make room for a niche, an arch, or a window.\n\nIn regular architecture, no other form of pediments can be admitted, besides the triangular and circular. Both of them are beautiful: and when a considerable number of pediments are introduced, as when a range of windows are adorned with them, these two figures may be used alternately, as in the niches of the Pantheon, and in those of the temple of Diana at N\u00eemes.\n\nThe proportion of pediments depends upon their size; for the same proportions will not do in all cases. When the base of the pediment is short, its height must be increased; and when the pediment is long, the height must be diminished. The best proportion for the height is from one fifth to one fourth of the base, according to the extent of the pediment, and the character of the body it covers. The materials of the roof must also be attended to; for if it be covered with tiles, it will be necessary to raise it more than one quarter of the base, as was the custom of the ancients in their Tuscan temples.\n\nThe tympan is always on a line with the front of the frieze; and, when large, admits of various ornaments.","sp":422,"ep":422},{"h":"OF PERSIANS AND CARYATIDES","t":"Besides columns and pilasters, it is sometimes customary to employ representations of the human figure, to support entablatures in buildings. The male figures are called Persians; and the female, Caryatids, or Caryatides. The ancients made frequent use of Persians and Caryatides, and delighted in diversifying them a thousand ways. The modern artists have followed their example; and there is a great variety of compositions of this kind to be met with in different parts of Europe.\n\nIndecent attitudes, distorted features, and all monstrous productions, ought to be avoided, of which there are many examples in Gothic buildings. On the contrary, the attitudes should be simple and graceful, the countenance always pleasing, though varied and strongly marked agreeable to the nature of the object represented.\n\nThe Caryatides, or female figures, should never much exceed the human size. But the Persians, or male figures, may be of any size; and the larger the better, as they will strike the beholder with the greater awe and astonishment. Persians may be used with propriety in arcades, galleries of armour, &c., under the figures of captives, heroic virtues, &c. Their entablature ought to be Doric, and bear the same proportion to them as to columns of the same height. The entablature for Caryatides ought to be either Ionic or Corinthian, according as the character of the figures is more or less delicate.\n\nTermini are sometimes employed, instead of Persians or Caryatides, to support the entablatures of monuments, chimney-pieces, and such like compositions. These figures owe their origin to the stones used by the ancients to mark the limits of particular possessions. Numa Pomplius, to render these inviolable, consecrated the terminus into a deity, and instituted festivals and sacrifices to his honour. In a short time, what was formerly only large upright stones, were represented in human shape; and afterwards introduced as ornaments to temples and other buildings. The termini are now principally used as ornaments for gardens and fields.","sp":419,"ep":419},{"h":"OF PILASTERS","t":"Pilasters differ from columns only in their plan; which is square, as that of columns is round. Their bases, capitals, and entablatures, have the same parts, with the same heights and projections, as those of columns: They are also distinguished in the same manner, by the names of Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite.\n\nThe column is undoubtedly more perfect than the pilaster. However, they may be employed with great propriety on many occasions. Some authors declaim against pilasters, because, according to them, they do not admit of diminution. But this is a mistake; there are many instances, in the remains of antiquity, of their being diminished. Scamozzi always gave his pilasters the same diminution as his columns: Palladio and Inigo Jones have likewise diminished them in many of their buildings.\n\nPilasters are employed in churches, galleries, halls, and other interior decorations, to save room; for, as they seldom project beyond the solid wall above one quarter of their diameter, they do not occupy near so much space as columns. They are likewise used in exterior decorations; sometimes alone, instead of columns, on account of their being less expensive; and sometimes they accompany columns, being placed behind them to support the architraves, where they enter the building, as in the Pantheon at Rome; or, in the same line with them, to fortify the angles, as in the portico of Septimius.\n\nWhen pilasters are used alone, they should project one quarter of their diameter beyond the walls. When placed behind columns, especially if they be very near them, they need not project above one eighth of their diameter. But, when placed on a line with columns, their projection must be regulated by that of the columns; and consequently, it can never be less than a semidiameter, even when the columns are engaged as much as possible.\n\nThe shafts of pilasters are frequently adorned with flutings, in the same manner as those of columns; the plan of which may be a trifle more than a semicircle: Their number must be seven on each face, which makes them nearly of the same size with those of columns. The intervals, or fillets, must either be one third or one fourth of the fluting in breadth.\n\nThe capitals of pilasters are profiled nearly in the same manner as those of columns.","sp":417,"ep":419},{"h":"OF ROOFS","t":"Plate XXXVII.

Of straight stairs, some fly directly forward; others are square; others triangular. Others are called French flights, or winding-stairs, (which in general are called spiral or cockle-flights;) of which some are square; some circular, or round; and some elliptical, or oval; and these again are various; for some wind about a solid, others about an open newel. Stairs mixt of straight and winding steps are also of various kinds; some are called dog-legged; some there are that wind about a solid newel; and others that fly about a square open newel.\n\nGreat care ought to be taken in placing of the stair-case in any building; and therefore stair-cases ought to be described, and accounted for justly, when the plan of a building is made. For want of this, sometimes unpardonable errors have been committed: Such as having a little blind stair-case to a large house; or, on the other hand, to have a large spacious stair-case to a little one.\n\nPalladio says, in placing stair-cases, the utmost care ought to be taken, it being difficult to find a place convenient for them, that will not at the same time prejudice the rest of the building. But commonly the stairs are placed in the angle, wing, or middle of the front.\n\nTo every stair-case are required three openings.\n\nFirst, the door leading thereto.\n\nSecondly, the window, or windows, that give light to it;\n\nAnd, thirdly, the landing.\n\nFirst, the door leading to a stair-case should be so placed, that most of the building may be seen before you come at the stairs, and in such a manner that it may be easy for any person to find out.\n\nSecondly, for the windows; if there be but one, it must be placed in the middle of the stair-case, that thereby the whole may be enlightened.\n\nThirdly, the landing of stairs should be large and spacious, for the convenient entering into rooms: In a word, stair-cases should be spacious, light, and easy in ascent.\n\nThe height of large steps must never be less than six inches, nor more than seven inches and a half.\n\nThe breadth of steps should never be less than ten inches, nor more than eighteen inches; and the length of them nor less than three feet, nor more than twelve.\n\nPlate XXXIV.

The rail can-\nnot be fixed less than one fourth part from the nosing or\nfront of the step.\n\nThe remaining part of the pitch-board may be divided\ninto any number of parts, as here into four; from these\ndivisions draw lines across the pitch-board to the raking-\nline; then take the distances from the ground-line of the\npitch-board to the plan of the rail, and set them perpen-\ndicular from the raking-line of the pitch-board; and\nthese divisions, when the rail is in its proper position, lie\ndirectly over the divisions on the ground-plan.\n\nIn this figure l, m, and n, rise as much above o as\nthe dotted line in fig. 5, does above the width of the\nrail; and they sink as much below o as the other dotted\nline in fig. 5, falls below the width of the rail; the same\nthicknesses must be glued upon o, though the greatest\npart will come off in squaring. The reason of placing\nthe letters l, m, and n, where they are, is, that they\nmight not obstruct the small divisions of the rail-mould.\n\nFig. 4.

The remaining part of the pitch-\nboard is divided into four parts, as before in fig. 7, and\nit takes in two such parts of the next step. Draw lines\nfrom these divisions to the diagonal of the pitch-board,\nas in fig. 7.; then take the distance a b, and set it from\nc to d, and so proceed with the other divisions.\n\nAnother way to find the outside of the rail-mould is,\nto draw all the divisions across the plan of the rail; then\ntake the distance from the ground-line of the pitch-board\nto 4, transfer it from the diagonal of the pitch-board to 4\non the rail; and so proceed with the other distances.\nNow, when the rail is put in its proper situation, c will\nbe perpendicular to b, and all the divisions, as 1, 2, 3,\n4, &c. in the rail, will be perpendicular to 1, 2, 3, 4, &c.\nin the ground-plan.\n\nFig. 6.

Sometimes the cornice is entirely plain, as in the temple of Bacchus; at others, as in the arch of Septimius Severus, it is enriched with dentils differing very little from the Ionic; and in the arch of Titus, there are both dentils and modillions; the whole form of the profile being the same with the Corinthian, as executed in the antiquities at Rome.\n\nThe modern architects have varied more in this than in any other order, each following the bent of his own fancy.\n\nThe height of the Composite column, and parts of the entablature, is the same with that of the Corinthian. The foot of the leaves of the capital ought not to project beyond the upper part of the shaft.

See Plate XXVIII.\n\nThe most perfect model of the Corinthian order is generally allowed to be in the three columns in the Campo Vaccino at Rome, the remains, as it is thought, of the temple of Jupiter Stator.\n\nThe Corinthian column should be 20 modules high, and the entablature 5; which proportions are a medium between those of the Pantheon and the three columns. The base of the column may either be Attic or Corinthian: They are both beautiful. If the entablature be enriched, the shaft may be fluted.

The situation of it is not perpendicular; for the lower end is inclined considerably inwards: So that the knees are almost contiguous, while there is a considerable distance between the thigh-bones above: Which is of good use to us, since sufficient space is thereby left for the external parts of generation, the two great cloaca of urine and feces, and for the large thick muscles that move the thigh inwards: And, at the same time, this situation of the thigh-bones renders our progression quicker, surer, straighter, and in less room.\n\nThe upper end of the thigh-bone is not continued in a straight line with the body of it, but is set off obliquely inwards and upwards, whereby the distance here between these two bones at their upper part is considerably increased.\u2014This end is formed into a large smooth round head, which is the greater portion of a sphere unequally divided.\u2014Towards its lower internal part, a round rough spongy pit is observable, where the strong ligament, commonly called the round one, is fixed, to be extended from thence to the lower internal part of the receiving cavity, where it is considerably broader than near to the head of the thigh-bone.\u2014The small part below the head, called the cervix, of the os femoris, has a great many large holes, into which the fibres of the strong ligament, continued from the capsular, enter, and are thereby surely united to it; and round the root of the neck, where it rises from the bone, a rough ridge is found, where the capsular ligament of the articulation itself is connected.\u2014Below the back-part of this root, the large unequal protuberance, called trochanter major, stands out; the external convex part of which is distinguished into three different surfaces, whereof the one on the fore-part is scabrous and rough, for the insertion of the gluteus minimus; the superior one is smooth, and has the gluteus medius inserted into it; and the one behind is made flat and smooth by the tendon of the gluteus maximus passing over it.\u2014The upper edge of this process is sharp and pointed at its back-part, where the gluteus medius is fixed; but forwards it is more obtuse, and has two superficial pits formed in it: Into the superior of these, the piriformis is implanted; and the obturator internus and gemini are fixed into the lower one.\none.\u2014From the backmost prominent part of this great trochanter, a rough ridge runs backwards and downwards, into which the quadratus is inserted.\u2014In the deep hollow, at the internal upper side of this ridge, the obturator externus is implanted.\u2014More internally, a conoid process, called trochanter minor, rises, for the insertion of the musculus psoas and iliacus internus, and the pectineus is implanted into a rough hollow below its internal root.\u2014The muscles inserted into these two processes being the principal instruments of the rotatory motion of the thigh, have occasioned the name of trochanters to the processes.\n\nThe body of the os femoris is convex on the fore-part, and made hollow behind, by the action of the muscles that move it and the leg, and for the convenience of sitting, without bearing too much on these muscles.\u2014The fore-part of the thigh-bone is a little flattened above by the beginning of the cruralis muscle, as it is also below by the same muscle and the rectus.\u2014Its external surface is likewise made flat below by the vastus externus, where it is separated from the former by an obtuse ridge.\u2014The vastus internus depresses a little the lower part of the internal surface.\u2014The posterior concave surface has a ridge rising in its middle, commonly called linea aspera, into which the triceps is inserted, and the short head of the biceps flexor tibiae rises from it.\u2014At the upper part of it, the medullary vessels enter by a small hole that runs obliquely upwards.\u2014A little above which, there is a rough fossa or two, where the tendon of the gluteus maximus is fixed.\u2014The lower end of the linea aspera divides into two, which descend towards each side.\u2014The two vasti muscles have part of their origin from these ridges; and the long tendon of the triceps is fixed to the internal, by means of part of the fascia aponeurotica of the thigh.\u2014Near the beginning of the internal ridge, there is a discontinuation of the ridge, where the crural artery passes through the aponeurosis.\u2014Between these two rough lines, the bone is made flat by the large blood-vessels and nerves which pass upon it; and near the end of each of these ridges, a small smooth protuberance may often be remarked, where the two heads of the external gastrocnemius muscle take their rise; and from the fore-part of the internal tubercle, a strong ligament is extended to the inside of the tibia.\n\nThe lower end of the os femoris is larger than any other part of it, and is formed into a great protuberance on each side, called its condyles; between which a considerable cavity is found, especially at the back-part, in which the crural vessels and nerves lie immersed in fat.\u2014The internal condyle is longer than the external.\u2014Each of these processes seems to be divided in its plain smooth surface. The mark of division on the external is a notch, and on the internal a small protuberance. The fore-part of this division, on which the rotula moves, is formed like a pulley, the external side of which is highest.\u2014Behind, there are two oblong large heads, whose greatest extent is backwards, for the motion of the tibia; and from the rough cavity between them, but near to the base of the internal condyle, the strong ligament, commonly called the cross one, has its rise.\u2014A little above which, a rough protuberance gives insertion to the tendon of the triceps.\u2014The condyles, both on the outer and inner side of the knee, are made flat by the muscles passing along them.\u2014On the back part of the internal, a slight depression is made by the tendons of the gracilis and sartorius; and on the external, such another is formed by the biceps flexor cruris; behind which, a deep fossa is to be observed, where the popliteus muscle has its origin.\u2014From the tubercle immediately before this cavity, a strong round ligament goes out to the upper part of the fibula.\u2014Round this lower end of the thigh-bone, large holes are found, into which the ligaments for the security of the joint are fixed, and blood-vessels pass to the internal substance of the bone.\n\nThe thigh-bone being articulated above with the acetabulum of the os innominata, which affords its round head a secure and extensive play, can be moved to every side; but is restrained in its motion outwards by the high brims of the cavity, and by the round ligament; for otherwise the head of the bone would have been frequently thrust out at the breach of the brims on the inside, which allows the thigh to move considerably inwards.\u2014The body of this bone enjoys little or no rotatory motion, though the head most commonly moves round its own axis; because the oblique progress of the neck and head from the bone is such, that the rotatory motion of the head can only bring the body of the bone forwards and backwards.\u2014The os femoris is articulated below to the tibia and rotula in the manner afterwards to be described.\n\nThe narrowness of the small neck to the round head of the thigh-bone, and its upper end being covered with very thick muscles, make greater difficulty in distinguishing between a luxation and fracture here, than in any other part of the body.\n\nThe Leg is composed of three bones, tibia, fibula, and rotula.\n\nTibia, so called from its resemblance to an old musical pipe or flute, is the long, thick, triangular bone, situated at the internal part of the leg, and continued in almost a straight line from the thigh-bone.\n\nThe upper end of the tibia is large, bulbous, and spongy, and is divided into two cavities by a rough irregular protuberance, which is hollow at its most prominent part, as well as before and behind. The anterior of the two ligaments that compose the great cross one, is inserted into the middle cavity, and the depression behind receives the posterior ligament.\u2014The two broad cavities at the sides of this protuberance are not equal; for the internal is oblong and deep, to receive the internal condyle of the thigh-bone; while the external is more superficial and rounder, for the external condyle.\u2014In each of these two cavities of a recent subject, a femoral cartilage is placed, which is thick at its convex edge, and becomes gradually thinner towards the concave or interior edge.\u2014The middle of each of these cartilages is broad, and the ends of them turn narrower and thinner, as they approach the middle protuberance of the tibia.\u2014The thick convex edge of each cartilage is connected to the capsular and other ligaments of the articulation, but so near to their rise from the tibia, that the cartilages\ncartilages are not allowed to change place far; while the narrow ends of the cartilages, becoming almost ligaments, are fixed at the insertion of the strong cross ligament into the tibia, and seem to have their subitance united with it; therefore a circular hole is left between each cartilage and the ligament, in which the most prominent convex part of each condyle of the thigh-bone moves.\u2014The circumference of these cavities is rough and unequal, for the firm connection of the ligaments of the joint.\u2014Immediately below the edge, at its back-part, two rough flattened protuberances stand out: Into the internal, the tendon of the semimembranosus muscle is inserted; and a part of the cross ligament is fixed to the external.\u2014On the outside of this last tubercle, a smooth slightly-hollowed surface is formed by the action of the popliteus muscle.\n\nBelow the fore-part of the upper end of the tibia, a considerable rough protuberance rises, to which the strong tendinous ligament of the rotula is fixed.\u2014On the internal side of this, there is a broad, scabrous, slightly-hollowed surface, to which the internal long ligament of the joint, the aponeurosis of the vastus internus, and the tendons of the semimembranosus, gracilis, and sartorius, are fixed.\u2014Below the external edge of the upper end of the tibia, there is a circular flat surface, covered, in a recent subject, with cartilage, for the articulation of the fibula;\u2014between which and the anterior knob, there is a rough hollow, from which the tibialis anticus, and extensor digitorum longus, take their origin.\u2014From the smooth flat surface, a ridge runs obliquely downwards and inwards, to give rise to part of the soleus, tibialis posterior, and flexor digitorum longus, and insertion to the aponeurosis of the semimembranosus which covers the popliteus, and to some of the external fibres of this last named muscle.\u2014At the inside of this ridge an oblique plain surface is left, where the greatest part of the musculus popliteus is inserted.\u2014The remaining body of the tibia is triangular.\u2014The anterior angle is very sharp, and is commonly called the spine or shin. This ridge is not straight; but turns first inwards, then ourwards, and lastly inwards again.\u2014The plain internal side is smooth and equal, being little subjected to the actions of muscles; but the external side is hollowed above by the tibialis anticus, and below by the extensor digitorum longus, and extensor pollicis longus.\u2014The two angles behind these sides are rounded by the action of the muscles;\u2014the posterior side comprehended between them is not so broad as those already mentioned, but is more oblique and flatted by the action of the tibialis posterior and flexor digitorum longus.\u2014Some way above the middle of the bone, the internal angle terminates, and the bone is made round by the pressure of the musculus soleus.\u2014Near to this, the passage of the medullary vessels is seen slanting obliquely downwards.\n\nThe lower end of the tibia is made hollow, but so as a small protuberance rises in the middle.\u2014The internal side of this cavity, which is smooth, and, in a recent subject, is covered with cartilage, is produced into a considerable process, commonly named malleolus internus; the point of which is divided by a notch, and from it ligaments are sent out to the foot.\u2014The external side of this end of the tibia has a rough irregular semilunar cavity formed in it, for receiving the lower end of the fibula.\u2014The posterior side has two lateral grooves, and a small middle protuberance. In the internal depression, the tendons of the musculus tibialis posterior, and flexor digitorum longus, are lodged; and in the external, the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis plays.\u2014From the middle protuberance, ligamentous sheaths go out, for tying down these tendons.\n\nFibula is the small long bone, placed on the outside of the leg, opposite to the external angle of the tibia; the shape of it is irregularly triangular.\n\nThe head of the fibula has a superficial circular cavity formed on its inside, which, in a recent subject, is covered with a cartilage, but so closely connected to the tibia by ligaments, as to allow only a small motion backwards and forwards.\u2014This head is protuberant and rough on its outside, where a strong round ligament, and the musculus biceps, are inserted; and, below the back-part of its internal side, a tubercle may be remarked, that gives rise to the strong tendinous part of the soleus muscle.\n\nThe body of this bone is a little crooked inwards and backwards, which figure is owing to the actions of the muscles; but is still further increased by nurses, who often hold children carelessly by the legs.\u2014The sharpest angle of the fibula is forwards, on each side of which the bone is considerably, but unequally, depressed by the bellies of the several muscles that rise from, or act upon it; and, in old people, these muscles make distinct sinuities for themselves.\u2014The external surface of the fibula is depressed obliquely from above downwards and backwards, by the two peronaei.\u2014Its internal surface is unequally divided into two narrow longitudinal planes, by an oblique ridge extended from the upper part of the anterior angle, to join with the lower end of the internal angle. To this ridge the ligament stretched between the two bones of the leg is connected.\u2014The anterior of the two planes is very narrow above, where the extensor longus digitorum, and extensor longus pollicis, arise from it; but is broader below, where it has the print of the nonus Vealii.\u2014The posterior plane is broad and hollow, giving origin to the larger share of the tibialis posterior.\u2014The internal angle of this bone has a tendinous membrane fixed to it, from which fibres of the flexor digitorum longus take their rise.\u2014The posterior surface of the fibula is the plainest and smoothest, but is made flat above by the soleus, and is hollowed below by the flexor pollicis longus.\u2014In the middle of this surface the canal for the medullary vessels may be seen slanting downwards.\n\nThe lower end of the fibula is extended into a spongy oblong head, on the inside of which is a convex, irregular, and frequently a scabrous surface, that is received by the external hollow of the tibia, and so firmly joined to it by a very thin intermediate cartilage and strong ligaments, that it scarcely can move.\u2014Below this, the fibula is stretched out into a coronoid process, that is smooth, covered with cartilage on its internal side, and is there contiguous to the outside of the first bone of the foot, the astragalus, to secure the articulation. This process, named malleolus externus, being situated farther back\nback than the internal malleolus, and in an oblique direction, obliges us naturally to turn the fore-part of the foot outwards. At the lower internal part of this process, a spongy cavity for mucilaginous glands may be remarked; from its point, ligaments are extended to the astragalus, os calcis, and os naviculare, bones of the foot; and from its inside, short strong ones go out to the altragalus. On the back-part of it, a sinuosity is made by the tendons of the peronaei muscles.\u2014When the ligament extended over these tendons from the one side of the depression to the other is broke, stretched too much, or made weak by a sprain, the tendons frequently start forwards to the outside of the fibula.\n\nThe conjunction of the upper end of the fibula with the tibia is, by plain surfaces, tipped with cartilage; and, at its lower end, the cartilage seems to glue the two bones together, not, however, so firmly in young people, but that the motion at the other end of such a long radius is very observable.\n\nThe principal use of this bone is to afford origin and insertion to muscles; the direction of which may be a little altered, on proper occasions, by its upper part shifting backwards and forwards.\u2014It likewise helps to make the articulation of the foot more secure and firm.\n\n**Rotula** is the small flat bone situated at the fore-part of the joint of the knee.\u2014Its shape resembles the common figure of the heart with its point downwards.\u2014The anterior convex surface of the rotula is pierced by a great number of holes, into which fibres of the strong ligament that is spread over it enter.\u2014Behind, its surface is smooth, covered with cartilage, and divided by a middle convex ridge into two cavities, of which the external is largest, and both are exactly adapted to the pulley of the os femoris, on which they are placed in the most ordinary untraining postures of the leg; but when the leg is much bended, the rotula descends far down on the condyles; and when the leg is fully extended, the rotula rises higher, in its upper part, than the pulley of the thigh-bone.\u2014The plain smooth surface is surrounded by a rough prominent edge, to which the capsular ligament adheres.\u2014Below, the point of the bone is scabrous, where the strong tendinous ligament from the tubercle of the tibia is fixed.\u2014The upper horizontal part of this bone is flatted and unequal, where the tendons of the extensors of the leg are inserted.\n\nThe substance of the rotula is cellular, with very thin external firm plates: But then these cells are so small, and such a quantity of bone is employed in their formation, that scarce any bone of its bulk is so strong. Besides, it is covered all over with a thick ligament, to connect its substance, and is moveable to one side or other; therefore is sufficiently strong to resist the ordinary actions of the large muscles that are inserted into it, or any common external force applied to it.\n\nThe parts which constitute the joint of the knee being now described, let us examine what are its motions, and how performed.\u2014The two principal motions are flexion and extension.\u2014In the former of these, the leg may be brought to a very acute angle with the thigh, by the condyles of the thigh-bones being round and made smooth far backwards. In performing this, the rotula is pulled down by the tibia.\u2014When the leg is to be extended, the rotula is drawn upwards, consequently the tibia forwards, by the extensor muscles; which, by means of the protuberant joint, and of this thick bone with its ligament, have in effect the chord, with which they act, fixed to the tibia at a considerable angle, therefore act with advantage; but are restrained from pulling the leg farther than to a straight line with the thigh, by the posterior part of the crois ligament, that the body might be supported by a firm perpendicular column: For at this time the thigh and leg are as little movable in a rotatory way, or to either side, as if they were one continued bone.\u2014But when the joint is a little bended, the rotula is not tightly braced, and the posterior ligament is relaxed; therefore this bone may be moved a little to either side, or with a small rotation in the superficial cavities of the tibia; which is done by the motion of the external cavity backwards and forwards, the internal serving as a sort of axis. Seeing then one part of the crois ligament is situated perpendicularly, and the posterior part is stretched obliquely from the internal condyle of the thigh outwards, that posterior part of the crois ligament prevents the leg's being turned at all inwards; but it could not hinder it from turning outwards almost round, was not that motion confined by the lateral ligaments of this joint, which can yield little.\n\nThe Foot is divided into three parts, viz. tarfur, metatarfus, and toes: In the description of which, the broad of the foot shall be called superior; the sole, inferior; the side on which the great toe is, internal; that where the little toe is, external.\n\nThe tarfur consists of seven spongy bones; to wit, the astragalus, os calcis, navicular, cuboides, cuneiform externum, cuneiform medium, and cuneiform internum.\n\nThe astragalus is the uppermost of these bones.\u2014The os calcis is below the astragalus, and is considerably prominent backwards beyond the other bones, to form the heel.\u2014The os naviculare is in the middle of the internal side of the tarfur.\u2014The os cuboides is the most external of the row of four bones at its fore-part.\u2014The os cuneiform externum is placed at the inside of the cuboid.\u2014The cuneiform medium is between the external and internal cuneiform bones, and the internal cuneiform is put at the internal side of the foot.\n\nIn the description of these bones, let it be observed, That wherever a ridge is mentioned, without a particular use assigned, a ligament is understood to be fixed to it: or where a spongy rough cavity, depression, or fossa, is remarked, without naming its use, a ligament is inserted, and mucilaginous glands are lodged.\n\nThe upper part of the astragalus is formed into a large smooth head, which is slightly hollowed in the middle; and therefore resembles a superficial pulley, by which it is fitted to the lower end of the tibia.\u2014The internal side of this head is flat and smooth, to play on the internal malleolus.\u2014The external side has also such a surface, but larger, for its articulation with the external malleolus.\u2014Round the base of this head there is a rough fossa; and, immediately before the head, as also\nbelow its internal smooth surface, we find a considerable rough cavity.\n\nThe lower surface of the astragalus is divided by an irregular, deep, rough fossa; which, at its internal end, is narrow, but gradually widens, as it stretches obliquely outwards and forwards.\u2014The smooth surface, covered with cartilage, behind this fossa, is large, oblong, extended in the same oblique situation with the fossa, and concave, for its conjunction with the os calcis.\u2014The back-part of the edge of this cavity is produced into two sharp-pointed rough processes, between which is a depression, made by the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus.\n\n\u2014The lower surface before the fossa is convex, and composed of three distinct smooth planes. The long one behind, and the exterior or shortest, are articulated with the heel-bone; while the internal, which is the most convex of the three, rests and moves upon a cartilaginous ligament, that is continued from the calcaneum to the os scaphoideum.\n\nThe fore-part of this bone is formed into a convex oblong smooth head, which is received by the os naviculare.\u2014Round the root of this head, especially on the upper surface, a rough fossa may be remarked.\n\nThe astragalus is articulated above to the tibia and fibula, which together form one cavity. Though, in this articulation, the bones have prominences and cavities so small, as might allow motions in all directions; yet the flexion and extension are the most considerable, the other motions being confined by the malleoli, and by the strong ligaments which go out from the points of these processes to the astragalus and os calcis. The astragalus is joined below to the os calcis; and before, to the os naviculare, in the manner to be explained when these bones are described.\n\nCalcaneum is the largest bone of the seven.\u2014Behind, it is formed into a large knob, commonly called the heel: The surface of which is rough behind, where the tendo Achillis is inserted into it; and above, it is hollow and spongy. Farther forwards, on the upper surface of the calcaneum, there is an irregular, oblong, smooth convexity, adapted to the concavity at the back-part of the astragalus: And beyond this a narrow fossa is seen, which divides it from two small concave smooth surfaces, that are joined to the fore-part of the astragalus.\u2014Behind the posterior of these smooth surfaces, which is the largest, a small sinuosity is made by the tendon of the flexor digitorum longus; at the fore-part of which a small rough protuberance appears, that gives rise to the musculus extensor digitorum brevis.\n\nThe external side of this bone is flat, with a superficial fossa running horizontally, in which the tendon of the musculus peronaeus longus is lodged.\u2014The internal side of the heel-bone is hollowed, for lodging the origin of the mallea cornea Jac. Sylvii, and for the safe passage of tendons, nerves, and arteries.\u2014Under the fide of the internal smooth concavity, a particular groove is made by the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus; and from the thin protuberance on this internal fide, the cartilaginous ligament that supports the astragalus, goes out to the os naviculare; on which ligament, and on the edge of this bone to which it is fixed, the groove is formed for the tendon of the flexor digitorum profundus.\n\nThe lower surface of this bone is pressed flat at the back-part, by the weight of our bodies; and immediately before this plane, there are two tubercles, from the internal of which the musculus abductor pollicis, flexor digitorum sublimis, as also part of the aponeurosis plantaris, and of the abductor minimi digiti, have their origin; and the other part of the abductor minimi digiti and aponeurosis plantaris, rises from the external.\n\nBefore these protuberances this bone is concave, for lodging the flexor muscles; and at its fore-part we may observe a rough depression, from which, and a tubercle behind it, the ligament goes out that prevents this bone to be separated from the os cuboides.\n\nThe fore-part of the os calcis is formed into an oblong, pulley-like, smooth surface, which is circular at its upper external end, but is pointed below. This smooth surface is fitted to the os cuboides.\n\nThough the surfaces by which the astragalus and os calcis are articulated, seem fit enough for motion; yet the very strong ligaments by which these bones are connected, prevent it, and render this principal part of our base, which rests on the ground, to wit, the os calcis, firm.\n\nOs naviculare, is somewhat circular.\u2014It is formed into an oblong concavity behind, for receiving the anterior head of the astragalus.\u2014On the upper surface, there is a rough fossa.\u2014Below, the os naviculare is very unequal and rough; but hollow for the safety of the muscles.\u2014On its inside, a large knob rises out, from which the abductor pollicis takes in part its origin, the tendon of the tibialis pollicis is inserted into it, and to it two remarkable ligaments are fixed; the first is the strong one, formerly mentioned, which supports the astragalus; the second is stretched from this bone obliquely across the foot, to the metatarsal bones of the middle toe, and of the toe next to the little one.\u2014On the outside of the os naviculare, there is a semicircular smooth surface, where it is joined to the os cuboides.\u2014The fore-part of this bone is all covered with cartilage, and is divided into three smooth planes, fitted to the three osa cuneiformia.\n\nThe os naviculare and astragalus are joined as a ball and socket, and the naviculare moves in all directions in turning the toes inwards, or in raising or depressing either side of the foot, though the motions are greatly restrained by the ligaments which connect this to the other bones of the tarsus.\n\nOs cuboides is a very irregular cube.\u2014Behind, it is formed into an oblong unequal concavity, adapted to the fore-part of the os calcis.\u2014On its internal side, there is a small semicircular smooth cavity, to join the os naviculare.\u2014Immediately before which, an oblong smooth plane is made by the os cuneiforme externum.\u2014Below this, the bone is hollow and rough.\u2014On the internal side of the lower surface, a round protuberance and fossa are found, where the musculus adductor pollicis has its origin. On the external side of this same surface, there is a round knob, covered with cartilage; immediately before which, a smooth fossa may be observed, in which the tendon of the peronaeus primus runs obliquely across the\nthe foot; and on the knob, the thin flat cartilage proper to this muscle plays; in place of which, sometimes a bone is found:\u2014More externally than the knob, a rough hollow is made, for the strong ligaments stretched between this bone and the os calcis.\u2014Before, the surface of the os cuboides is flat, smooth, and slightly divided into two planes, for sustaining the os metatarsi of the little toe, and of the toe next to it.\n\nThe form of the back-part of the os cuboides, and the ligaments connecting the joint there with the os calcis, both concur in allowing little motion in this part.\n\nOs cuneiforme externum, is much of the shape of a wedge, being broad and flat above, with long sides running obliquely downwards, and terminating in a sharp edge.\u2014The upper surface of this bone is an oblong square.\u2014The one behind is nearly a triangle, but not complete at the inferior angle, and is joined to the os naviculare.\u2014The external side is an oblong square, divided as it were by a diagonal: The upper half of it is smooth, for its conjunction with the os cuboides: The other is a scabrous hollow; and in its superior anterior angle, a small smooth impression is made by the os metatarsi of the toe next to the little one.\u2014The internal side of this bone is also quadrangular, with the fore-part of its edge made flat and smooth by the os metatarsi of the toe next to the great one; and the back-part is also flat and smooth, where the os cuneiforme medium is contiguous to it.\u2014The fore-part of this bone is an oblong triangle, for sustaining the os metatarsi of the middle toe.\n\nOs cuneiforme medium, or minimum, is still more exactly the shape of a wedge than the former.\u2014Its upper part is square;\u2014its internal side has a flat smooth surface above and behind, for its conjunction with the following bone; with a small rough fossa below; and a considerable share of it is rough and hollow.\u2014The external side is smooth and a little hollowed, where it is contiguous to the last described bone.\u2014Behind, this bone is triangular, where it is articulated with the os naviculare; and it is also triangular at its fore-part, where it is contiguous to the os metatarsi of the toe next to the great one.\n\nOs cuneiforme maximum, or internum, differs from the two former in its situation, which is more oblique than theirs.\u2014Besides, its broad thick part is placed below, and the small thin point is above and outwards; while its under broad surface is concave, for allowing a safe passage to the flexors of the great toe.\u2014The surface of this os cuneiforme behind, where it is joined to the os naviculare, is hollow, smooth, and of a circular figure below, but pointed above.\u2014The external side consists of two smooth and flat surfaces, whose direction is nearly at right angles with each other. With the posterior, that runs obliquely from below forwards and upwards, the os cuneiforme minimum is joined; and with the anterior, whose direction is longitudinal, the os metatarsi of the toe next to the great one is connected.\u2014The fore-part of this bone is semilunar, but flat and smooth, for sustaining the os metatarsi of the great toe.\u2014The internal side is scabrous, with two remarkable tubercles below, from which the musculus abductor pollicis rises, and the tibialis anticus is inserted into its upper part.\n\nThe three cuneiform bones are all so secured by ligaments, that very little motion is allowed in any of them.\n\nThese seven bones of the tarus, when joined, are convex above, and leave a concavity below, for lodging safely the several muscles, tendons, vessels, and nerves that lie in the sole of the foot.\u2014In the recent subject, their upper and lower surfaces are covered with strong ligaments, which adhere firmly to them; and all the bones are so tightly connected, by these and the other ligaments, which are fixed to the rough ridges and fossae formerly mentioned, that, notwithstanding the many surfaces covered with cartilage, some of which are of the form of the very moveable articulations, no more motion is here allowed, than only to prevent too great a shock of the fabric of the body in walking, leaping, &c. by falling on too solid a base.\n\nMetatarsus is composed of five bones, which, in their general characters, agree with the metacarpal bones; but may be distinguished from them by the following marks: 1. They are longer, thicker, and stronger. 2. Their anterior round ends are not so broad, and are less in proportion to their bases. 3. Their bodies are sharper above and flatter on the sides, with their inferior ridge inclined more to the outside. 4. The tubercles at the lower parts of the round head are larger.\n\nThe first or internal metatarsal bone is easily distinguished from the rest by its thickness.\u2014The one next to it is the longest, and with its sharp edge almost perpendicular.\u2014The others are shorter and more oblique, as their situation is more external.\n\nOs metatarsi pollicis is by far the thickest and strongest, as having much the greatest weight to sustain. Its base is oblong, irregularly concave, and of a semilunar figure, to be adapted to the os cuneiforme maximum.\u2014The inferior edge of this base is a little prominent and rough, where the tendon of the peronaeus primus muscle is inserted.\u2014On its outside, an oblique circular depression is made by the second metatarsal bone.\u2014Its round head has generally on its fore-part a middle ridge, and two oblong cavities, for the osa sesamoidea; and on the external side, a depression is made by the following bone.\n\nOs metatarsi of the second toe, is the longest of the five, with a triangular base supported by the os cuneiforme medium and the external side produced into a process; the end of which is an oblique smooth plane, joined to the os cuneiforme externum.\u2014Near the internal edge of the base, this bone has two small depressions, made by the os cuneiforme maximum, between which is a rough cavity.\u2014Farther forwards, we may observe a smooth protuberance, which is joined to the foregoing bone.\u2014On the outside of the base are two oblong smooth surfaces, for its articulation with the following bone; the superior smooth surface being extended longitudinally, and the inferior perpendicularly; between which there is a rough fossa.\n\nOs metatarsi of the middle toe, is the second in length.\u2014Its base, supported by the os cuneiforme externum, is triangular, but slanting outwards, where it ends in a sharp-pointed little process; and the angle below is not completed.\nThe internal side of this base is adapted to the preceding bone; and the external side has also two smooth surfaces covered with cartilage, but of a different figure; for the upper one is concave, and, being round behind, turns smaller as it advances forwards; and the lower surface is little, smooth, convex, and very near the edge of the base.\n\nOs metatarsi of the fourth toe, is near as long as the former, with a triangular slanting base, joined to the os cuboides, and made round at its external angle, having one hollow smooth surface on the outside, where it is pressed upon by the following bone, and two on the internal side, corresponding to the former bone; behind which is a long narrow surface impressed by the os cuneiforme externum.\n\nOs metatarsi of the little toe, is the shortest, situated with its two flat sides above and below, and with the ridges laterally.\u2014The base of it, part of which rests on the os cuboides, is very large, tuberous, and produced into a long-pointed process externally, where part of the abductor minimi digiti is fixed; and into its upper part the peronaeus secundus is inserted.\u2014Its inside has a flat conoidal surface, where it is contiguous to the preceding bone.\n\nWhen we stand, the fore-ends of these metatarsal bones, and the os calcis, are our only supporters; and therefore it is necessary they should be strong, and should have a confined motion.\n\nThe bones of the toes are much akin to those of the thumb and fingers; particularly the two of the great toe are precisely formed as the two last of the thumb; only their position, in respect of the other toes, is not oblique; and they are proportionally much stronger, because they are subjected to a greater force; for they sustain the force with which our bodies are pushed forwards by the foot behind at every step we make; and on them principally the weight of the body is supported, when we are raised on our tiptoes.\n\nThe three bones in each of the other four toes, compared to those of the fingers, differ from them in these particulars.\u2014They are less, and smaller in proportion to their lengths.\u2014Their bases are much larger than their anterior ends; Their bodies are more narrow above and below, and flatter on the sides.\u2014The first phalanx is proportionally much longer than the bones of the second and third, which are very short.\n\nOf the four, the toe next to the great one has the largest bones in all dimensions, and more externally the toes are less.\u2014The little toe, and frequently that next to it, have the second and third bones intimately united into one; which may be owing to their little motion, and the great pressure they are subjected to.\n\nThe toes are of good use to us in walking; for, when the sole is raised, they bring our body, with its centre of gravity, perpendicular to the advanced foot.\n\nThe only bones now remaining to complete the description of the skeleton, are the small ones, which are found at the joints of the fingers and toes, and in some other parts, called\n\nOssa Sesamoidea, which are of very different figures and sizes, though they are generally said to resemble the seed of the falenum.\u2014They seem to be nothing else than the ligaments of the articulations, or the firm tendons of strong muscles, or both, become bony, by the compression which they suffer. Thus the sesamoid bones at the beginning of the gastrocnemii muscles, are evidently composed of the tendinous fibres only.\u2014These, at the first joint of the great toe, are as plainly the same continued substance with the ligaments and the tendons of the adductor, flexor, brevis, and abductor.\u2014That which is sometimes double at the second joint of that toe, is part of the capitular ligament; and if we enumerate the other sesamoid bones that are at any time found, we may observe all of them formed in this manner.\u2014Their number, figure, situation, and magnitude, are so uncertain, that it were in vain to insist on the differences of each; and therefore we shall only in general remark,\n\n1. That wherever the tendons and ligaments are firmest, the actions of the muscles strongest, and the compression greatest, there such bones are most commonly found.\n\n2. That, ceteris paribus, the older the subject is in which they are sought, their number is greater, and their size is larger.\n\n3. The more labour any person is inured to, he has, ceteris paribus, the most numerous and largest osa sesamoidea.","sp":222,"ep":228},{"h":"OF THE IONIC ORDER","t":"The Ionic Order (Plate XXVI.) is of a more slender make than the Doric or Tuscan; its appearance is simple, yet graceful and majestic; its ornaments are few; so that it has been compared to a sedate matron, in decent, rather than magnificent attire.\n\nAmong the ancients, the form of the Ionic profile appears to have been more positively determined than that of any other order; for, in all the antiquities at Rome, (the temple of Concord excepted) it is exactly the same.\n\nThe modern artists have likewise been unanimous in their opinions; all of them, excepting Palladio and his imitators, having employed the dentil, cornice, and the other parts of the profile, nearly as they are found in the Collisicum, the temple of Fortune, and the theatre of Marcellus.\n\nThe height of the Ionic column is 18 modules, and that of the entablature 4\u00bd, or one quarter of the height of the column, as in the other orders, which is a trifle less than in any of the antique Ionics. In all the antiquities, the base is Attic; and the shaft of the column may either be plain, or fluted with 24 flutings, or 20 only, as in the temple of Fortune. The plan of the flutings may be a trifle more than a semicircle, as in the forum of Nerva, because they then appear more distinct. The fillets, or intervals between them, must not be broader than one third of the breadth of a fluting, nor narrower than one fourth. The ornaments of the capital must correspond with the flutings of the shaft; and there must be an ove above the middle of each fluting. The volutes ought to be traced according to Mr Guldman's method, which is as follows:\n\nPlate XXVII. fig. 9. Draw the cathetus F C, whose length must be 15 minutes, or one fourth of a module; and, from the point C, describe the eye of the volute A E B D, of which the diameter is to be 6\u00bd minutes; divide it into four equal sectors by the diameters A B, D E. Bisect the radii C A, C B, in 1 and 4; and on the line 1, 4, construct a square 1, 2, 3, 4. From the centre C, to the angles 2, 3, draw the diagonals C 2, C 3, and divide the side of the square 1, 4, into 6 equal parts, at 5, 9, C, 12, 8. Then through the points 5, 9, 12, 8, draw the lines 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 11, 8, 7, parallel to the diameter E D, which will cut the diagonals in 6, 7, 10, 11; and the points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, will be the centres of the volute. From the first centre 1, with the distance 1 F, describe the quadrant F G; from the second centre 2, with the distance 2 G, describe the quadrant G H; and, continuing the same operation from all the 12 centres, the contour of the volute will be completed.\n\nFig. 10. The centres for describing the fillet are found in this manner. Construct a triangle, of which the side A F is equal to the part of the cathetus contained between A F and the side F V, equal to C 1; place the distance F S from F towards A, equal to F S the breadth of the fillet, and through the point S draw the line S T, which will be to C 1 in the same proportion as A S is to A F; place this line on the diameter of the eye A B; divide it into three equal parts; and, through the points of division, draw lines parallel to the diameter E D, which will cut the diagonals C 2, C 3, and you will have twelve new centres, from whence the interior contour of the fillet may be described, in the same manner as the exterior one was from the first centres.","sp":405,"ep":406},{"h":"OF THE NERVES","t":"Sect. I. Of the Nerves in general.\n\nThe medullary substance of the brain is employed in forming the white fibrous cords, which are called nerves. Within the skull we see the nerves to be the medullary substance continued; and the spinal marrow is all employed in forming nerves.\n\nThe nerves are composed of a great many threads, lying parallel to each other, or nearly so, at their exit from the medulla.\n\nThis fibrous texture is evident at the origin of most of the nerves within the skull; and in the cauda equina of the spinal marrow we can divide them into such small threads, that a very good eye can scarce perceive them; but these threads, when looked at with a microscope, appear each to be composed of a great number of smaller threads.\n\nHow small one of these fibrils of the nerves is, we know not; but when we consider that every, even the most minute part of the body is sensible, and that this must depend on the nerves, (which all conjoined would not make a cord of an inch diameter), being divided into branches or filaments to be dispersed through all these minute parts, we must be convinced, that the nervous fibrils are very small.\n\nThe medullary substance, of which the nervous fibrils are composed, is very tender, and would not be able to resist such forces as the nerves are exposed to within the bones, nor even the common force of the circulating fluids, were not the pia mater and tunica arachnoides continued upon them; the former giving them firmness and strength, and the latter furnishing a cellular coat to connect the threads of the nerves, to let them lie soft and moist, and to support the vessels which go with them.\n\nIt is this cellular substance that is intended when air is forced through a blow-pipe thrust into a nerve, and that makes a nerve appear all spongy, after being distended with air till it dries; the proper nervous fibrils shrinking so in drying, that they scarce can be observed.\n\nThese coats would not make the nerves strong enough to bear the stretching and pressure they are exposed to in their course to the different parts of the body; and therefore, where the nerves go out at the holes in the cranium and spine, the dura mater is generally wrapped closely round them, to collect their disgregated fibres into tight firm cords; and that the tension which they may happen to be exposed to may not injure them before they have got this additional coat, it is firmly fixed to the sides of the holes in the bones through which they pass.\n\nThe nervous cords, thus composed of nervous fibrils, cellular coat, pia and dura mater, have such numerous blood-vessels, that, after their arteries only are injected, the whole cord is tinged of the colour of the injected liquor.\n\nA nervous cord has very little elasticity, compared with several other parts of the body. When cut out of the body, it does not become observably shorter, while the blood-vessels contract three eighths of their length.\n\nNerves are generally lodged in a cellular or fatty substance, and have their course in the interstices of muscles, where they are guarded from pressure; but in several parts they are so placed, as if it was intended that they should there suffer the vibrating force of arteries, or the pressure of the contracting fibres of muscles.\n\nThe larger cords of the nerves divide into branches as they go off to the different parts; the branches being smaller than the trunk from which they come, and making generally an acute angle where they separate.\n\nIn several places, different nerves unite into one cord, which is commonly larger than any of the nerves which form it. Several nerves, particularly those which are distributed to the bowels, after such union, suddenly form a hard knot considerably larger than all the nerves of which it is made. These knots were formerly called corpora olivaria, and are now generally named ganglia.\n\nThe ganglia have thicker coats, more numerous and larger blood-vessels than the nerves; so that they appear more red and muscular.\n\nCommonly numerous small nerves, which conjunctly are not equal to the size of the ganglion, are sent out from it, but with a structure no way different from that of other nerves.\n\nThe nerves sent to the organs of the senses, lose there their firm coats, and terminate in a pulpy substance. The optic nerves are expanded into the soft tender webs, the retinae. The auditory nerve has scarce the consistence of mucus in the vestibulum, cochlea, and semicircular canals of each ear. The papillae of the nose, tongue, and skin, are very soft.\n\nThe nerves of muscles can likewise be traced till they seem to lose their coats by becoming very soft; from which, and what we observed of the sensory nerves, there is reason to conclude, that the muscular nerves are also pulpy at their terminations, which we cannot indeed prosecute by dissection.\n\nSect.\nSect. II. Of the particular Nerves.\n\nIt is generally said, that there are forty pair of nerves in all; of which ten come out from the encephalon, and the other thirty have their origin from the spinal marrow.\n\nOf the ten pair of nerves which come from the encephalon, the first is the Olfactory, which have their origin from the corpora striata, near the part where the internal carotid arteries are about to send off their branches to the different parts of the brain; and in their course under the anterior lobes of the brain, which have each a depression made for lodging them, become larger, till they are extended to the cribriform bone; where they split into a great number of small filaments, to pass through the little holes in that bone; and being joined by a branch of the fifth pair of nerves, are spread on the membrane of the nose.\n\nThe tender structure and sudden expansion of these nerves on such a large surface, render it impossible to trace them far; which has made some authors deny them to be nerves: But when we break the circumference of the cribriform lamella, and then gently raise it, we may see the distribution of the nerves some way on the membrane of the nose.\n\nThe contrivance of defending these long soft nerves from being too much pressed by the anterior lobes of the brain under which they lie, is singular; because they have not only the prominent orbital processes of the frontal bone to support the brain on each side, with the veins going into the longitudinal sinus, and other attachments bearing it up, but there is a groove formed in each lobe of the brain itself for them to lodge in \u2014 Their splitting into so many small branches before they enter the bones of the skull, is likewise peculiar to them; for generally the nerves come from the brain in aggregated filaments, and unite into cords, as they are going out at the holes of the bones. This contrivance is the best for answering the purpose they are designed for, of being the organ of smelling; for had they been expanded upon the membrane of the nose into a medullary web, such as the optic nerve forms, it would have been too sensible to bear the impressions of such objects as are applied to the nose; and a distribution in the more common way, of a cord sending off branches, would not have been equal enough for such an organ of sensation.\n\nThe second pair of nerves, the Optic, rising from the thalami nervorum opticorum, make a large curve outwards, and then run obliquely inwards and forwards, till they unite at the fore-part of the sella turcica; then soon divide, and each runs obliquely forwards and cut-wards to go out at its proper hole in the sphenoid bone, accompanied with the ocular artery, to be extended to the globe of the eye, within which each is expanded into a very fine cuplike web, that lines all the inside of the eye as far forwards as the ciliary circle, and is universally known by the name of Retina.\n\nThough the substance of this pair of nerves seems to be blended at the place where they are joined; yet observations of people whose optic nerves were not joined, and of others who were blind of one eye from a fault in the optic nerve, or in those who had one of their eyes taken out, make it appear, that there is no such intimate union of substance; the optic nerve of the affected side only being wasted, while the other was large and plump. And the same observations are contradictory to the doctrine of a decussation of all the nerves, for the disease could be traced from the affected eye to the origin of the nerve on the same side.\n\nThese people whose optic nerves were not joined, having neither seen objects double, nor turned their eyes different ways, is also a plain proof, that the conjunction of the optic nerves will not serve to account for either the uniform motions of our eyes, or our seeing objects single with two eyes.\n\nThe retina of a recent eye, without any preparation, appears a very fine web, with some blood-vessels coming from its center to be distributed on it; but, after a good injection of the arteries that run in the substance of this nerve, as is common to other nerves, it is with difficulty that we can observe its nervous medullary substance. \u2014 The situation of these vessels in the central part of the optic nerve, the want of medullary fibres here, and the firmness of this nerve before it is expanded at its entry into the ball of the eye, may be the reason why we do not see such bodies, or parts of bodies, whose picture falls on this central part of the retina.\n\nThe Third Pair rise from the anterior part of the processus annularis, and piercing the dura mater a little before, and to a side of the ends of the posterior clinoid process of the sphenoid bone, run along the receptacula, or cavernous sinuses, at the side of the ephippium, to get out at the foramina lacera; after which each of them divides into branches, of which one, after forming a little ganglion, is distributed to the globe of the eye; the others are sent to the musculus rectus of the palpebra, and to the attollens, adductor, deprimens, and obliquus minor muscles of the eye-ball. These muscles being principal instruments in the motions of the eye-lid and eye-ball, this nerve has therefore got the name of the Motor Oculi.\n\nThe Fourth Pair, which are the smallest nerves of any, derive their origin from the back-part of the base of the testes; and then making a long course on the side of the annular protuberance enter the dura mater a little farther back, and more externally than the third part, to run also along the receptacula, to pass out at the foramina lacera, and to be entirely spent on the musculi trochlearis, or superior oblique muscles of the eyes. These muscles being employed in performing the rotatory motions, and the advancement of the eye-balls forward, by which several of our passions are expressed, the nerves that serve them have got the name of Pathetici.\n\nThe Fifth Pair are large nerves, rising from the annular processes where the medullary processes of the cerebellum join in the formation of that tuber, to enter the dura mater near the point of the petrous process of the temporal bones; and then sinking close by the receptacula at the sides of the sella turcica, each becomes in appearance thicker, and goes out of the skull in three great branches.\n\nThe first branch of the fifth is the Ophthalmic, which runs through the foramen lacerum, to the orbit,\nhaving in its passage thither a connection with the fifth pair. It is afterwards distributed to the ball of the eye with the third; to the nose, along with the olfactory, which the branch of the fifth that passes through the foramen orbitarium internum joins, as was already mentioned in the description of the first pair. This ophthalmic branch likewise supplies the parts at the internal canthus of the orbit, the glandula lacrymalis, fat, membranes, muscles, and teguments of the eye-lids; its longest farthest extended branch passing through the foramen supraciliary of the os frontis, to be distributed to the forehead.\n\nThe second branch of the fifth pair of nerves may be called Maxillaris Superior, from its serving principally the parts of the upper jaw. It goes out at the round hole of the sphenoid bone, and sends immediately one branch into the channel on the top of the antrum maxillare; the membrane of which and the upper teeth are supplied by it in its passage. As this branch is about to go out at the foramen orbitarium externum, it sends a nerve through the substance of the os maxillare to come out at Steno's duct, to be distributed to the fore-part of the palate; and what remains of it escaping at the external orbital hole, divides into a great many branches, that supply the cheek, upper lip, and nostril. The next considerable branch of the superior maxillary nerve, after giving branches which are reflected through the fifth hole of the sphenoid bone, to join the intercostal where it is passing through the skull with the carotid artery, and the portio dura of the seventh pair, as it passes through the os petrosum, is sent into the nose by the hole common to the palate and sphenoidal bone; and the remaining part of this nerve runs in the palato-maxillaris canal, giving off branches to the temples and pterygoid muscles, and comes at last into the palate to be lost.\n\nThe third or Maxillaris Inferior branch of the fifth pair going out at the oval hole of the sphenoid bone, serves the muscles of the lower jaw, and the muscles situated between the os hyoides and jaw: All the salivary glands, the amygdala, and the external ear, have branches from it: It has a large branch lost in the tongue, and sends another through the canal in the substance of the lower jaw to serve all the teeth there, and to come out at the hole in the fore-part of the jaw, to be lost in the chin and under lip.\n\nThe Sixth Pair, which is the smallest except the fourth, rises from the fore-part of the corpora pyramidalia; and each entering the dura mater some way behind the posterior clinoid process of the sphenoid bone, has a long course below that membrane, and within the receptaculum at the side of the sella turcica, where it is immersed in the blood of the receptacle: It goes afterwards out at the foramen lacerum into the orbit, to serve the adductor muscle of the eye.\u2014A defect in this nerve may therefore be one cause of a strabismus.\u2014In the passage of this nerve below the dura mater, it lies very contiguous to the internal carotid artery, and to the ophthalmic branch of the fifth pair of nerves. At the place where the fifth pair is contiguous to the carotid, a nerve either goes from each of them in an uncommon way, to wit, with the angle beyond where it rises obtuse, to defend with the artery, and to form the beginning of the intercostal nerve, according to the common description; or, according to other authors, this nerve comes up from the great ganglion of the intercostal, to be joined to the sixth here.\n\nThe Seventh Pair comes out from the lateral part of the annular process behind where the medullary processes of the cerebellum are joined to that tuber; and each being accompanied with a larger artery than most other nerves, enters the internal meatus auditorius, where the two large bundles of fibres, of which it appeared to consist within the skull, soon separate from each other; one of them entering by several small holes into the vestibule, cochlea, and semicircular canals, is stretched on this inner camera of the ear in a very soft pulpy substance; and being never seen in the form of a firm cord, such as the other parcel of this and most other nerves become, is called Portio Mollis of the auditory nerve.\n\nThe other part of this seventh pair passes through Galen's foramen c\u00e6cum, or Fallopian's aqueduct, in its crooked passage by the side of the tympanum; in which passage, a nerve sent from the lingual branch of the inferior maxillary nerve, along the outside of the tuba Eustachiana, and crosses the cavity of the tympanum, where it has the name of chorda tympani, is commonly said to be joined to it. The very acute angle which this nerve makes with the fifth, or the sudden violent reflection it would suffer on the supposition of its coming from the fifth to the seventh, appears unusual; whereas, if we suppose that it comes from the seventh to the fifth, its course would be more in the ordinary way, and the chorda tympani would be esteemed a branch of the seventh pair going to join the fifth, the size of which is increased by this acquisition. This smaller bundle of the seventh gives branches to the muscles of the malleus, and to the dura mater, while it passes through the bony crooked canal; and at last comes out in a firm chord named Portio Dura, at the end of this canal, between the styloid and mastoid processes of the temporal bone, giving immediately filaments to the little oblique muscles of the head, and to those that rise from the styloid process. It then pierces through the parotid gland, and divides into a great many branches, which are dispersed in the muscles and teguments that cover all the side of the upper part of the neck, the whole face and cranium, as far back as the temples, including a considerable part of the external ear.\n\nThe Eighth Pair of nerves rise from the lateral bases of the corpora olivaria in disgregated fibres; and as they are entering the anterior internal part of the holes common to the os occipitis and temporum, each is joined by a nerve which ascends within the dura mater from the tenth of the head, the first, second and inferior cervical nerves: This everybody knows has the name of the Nervus Accessorius. When the two get out of the skull, the accessorius separates from the eighth, and, descending obliquely outwards, passes through the sternomastoid muscle, to which it gives branches, and afterwards terminates in the trapezius and rhomboid muscles of the scapula. In this course it is generally more or less joined by the second cervical nerve.\n\nThe large Eighth Pair, soon after its exit, gives\nnerves to the tongue, larynx, pharynx, and ganglion of the intercostal nerve, and being disjoined from the ninth and intercostal, to which it adheres closely some way, runs straight down the neck behind the internal jugular vein, and at the external side of the carotid artery. As it is about to enter the thorax, a large nerve goes off from the right of each side; This branch of the right-side turns round from the fore to the back part of the subclavian artery, while the branch of the left-side turns round the great curve of the aorta; and both of them mounting up again at the side of the oesophagus, to which they give branches, are lost at last in the larynx. These are called the Recurrent nerves, which we are desired to shun in the operation of bronchotomy, though their deep situation protects them sufficiently.\n\nThe eighth pair, above, and at or near the place where the recurrent nerves go off from it, or frequently the recurrants themselves, send off small nerves to the pericardium, and to join with the branches of the intercostal that are distributed to the heart; but their size and situation are uncertain.\n\nAfter these branches are sent off, the par vagum on each side descends behind the great branch of the trachea, and gives numerous filaments to the lungs, and some to the heart in going to the oesophagus. The one of the left-side running on the fore-part of the oesophagus, communicates by several branches with the right one in its descent to be distributed to the stomach; The right one gets behind the oesophagus, where it splits and rejoins several times before it arrives at the stomach, to which it sends nerves; and then being joined by one or more branches from the left trunk, they run towards the celiac artery, there to join into the great semilunar ganglion formed by the two intercostals.\n\nThe Ninth Pair of nerves comes from the inferior part of the corpora pyramidalia, to go out of the skull at their proper holes of the occipital bone. After their egress they adhere for some way firmly to the eighth and intercostal; and then sending a branch, that in many subjects is joined with branches of the first and second cervical nerves, to be distributed to the thyroid gland and muscles on the fore-part of the trachea arteria, the ninth is lost in the muscles and substance of the tongue.\n\nThe Tenth Pair rises in separate threads from the sides of the spinal marrow, to go out between the os occipitis and first vertebra of the neck. After each of them has given branches to the great ganglion of the intercostal, 8th, 9th, and 1st cervical nerves, it is distributed to the straight, oblique, and some of the extensor muscles of the head.\n\nThe branch reflected from the fifth pair, joined possibly by some filaments of the ophthalmic branch of the fifth, runs along with the internal carotid artery, through the crooked canal formed for it in the temporal bone, where the little nerve is very soft and pappy, and in several subjects divides and unites again, and is joined by one or more branches from the fifth particularly of its superior maxillary branch, before it comes out of the skull. As soon as the nerve escapes out of this bony canal, it is connected a little way with the eighth and ninth; then separating from these, after seeming to receive additional nerves from them, it forms a large ganglion, into which branches from the tenth of the head, and from the first and second cervical, enter. From this ganglion the nerves come out again small, to run down the neck along with the carotid artery, communicating by branches with the cervical nerves, and giving nerves to the muscles that bend the head and neck. As the intercostal is about to enter the thorax, it forms another ganglion, from which nerves are sent to the trachea and to the heart; these designed for the heart joining with the branches of the eighth, and most of them passing between the two great arteries and the auricles, to the substance of that muscle. The intercostal after this consisting of two branches, one going behind, and the other running over the fore-part of the subclavian artery, forms a new ganglion where the two branches unite below that artery, and then descending along the sides of the vertebrae of the thorax, receives branches from each of the dorsal nerves; which branches appearing to come out between the ribs, have given the name of intercostal to the whole nerve. Where the addition is made to it from the fifth dorsal nerve, a branch goes off obliquely forwards; which being joined by such branches from the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth dorsal, an anterior trunk is formed, and passes between the fibres of the appendix musculosa of the diaphragm, to form, along with the other intercostal and the branches of the eighth pair, a large semilunar ganglion situated between the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries; the roots of which are as it were involved in a sort of nervous net-work of this ganglion, from which a great number of very small nervous threads run out to be extended on the surface of all the branches of those two arteries, so as to be easily seen when any of the arteries are stretched, but not to be raised from them by dissection; and thus the liver, gall-bladder, duodenum, pancreas, spleen, jejunum, ilium, and a large share of the colon, have their nerves sent from this great solar ganglion or plexus.\n\nSeveral fibres of this ganglion, running down upon the aorta, meet with other nerves sent from the posterior trunk of the intercostal, which continues its course along the sides of the vertebra, they supply the glandula renale, kidneys, and testes in men, or ovaria in women; and then they form a net-work upon the inferior mesenteric artery where the nerves of the two sides meet, and accompany the branches of this artery to the part of the colon that lies in the left side of the belly, and to the rectum, as far down as to the lower part of the pelvis.\n\nThe intercostal continuing down by the side of the vertebrae of the loins, is joined by nerves coming from between these vertebrae, and sends nerves to the organs of generation and others in the pelvis, being even joined with those that are sent to the inferior extremities.\n\nThe Spinal Nerves rise generally by a number of diffused fibres from both the fore and back part of the medulla spinalis, and soon after form a little knot or ganglion, where they acquire strong coats, and are extended into firm cords. They are distinguished by numbers, according to the vertebrae from between which they come out; the superior of the two bones forming the hole through which they pass, being the one from which the number\nnumber is applied to each nerve. There are generally said to be thirty pair of them; seven of which come out between the vertebrae of the neck, twelve between those of the back, five between those of the loins, and six from the false vertebrae.\n\nThe First Cervical pair of nerves comes out between the first and second vertebrae of the neck; and having given branches to join with the tenth pair of the head, the second cervical and intercostal, and to serve the muscles that bend the neck, it sends its largest branches backwards to the extensor muscles of the head and neck; some of which piercing through these muscles, run up on the occiput to be lost in the teguments here; and many fibres of it advance so far forward as to be connected with the fibrils of the first branch of the fifth pair of the head, and of the portio dura of the auditory nerve.\n\nThe Second Cervical is soon joined, by some branches, to the ninth of the head and intercostal, and to the first and third of the neck; then has a large branch that comes out at the exterior edge of the sternomastoideus muscle, where it joins with the accessorius of the eighth pair; and is afterwards distributed to the platysma myoides, teguments of the side of the neck and head, parotid gland, and external ear, being connected to the portio dura of the auditory nerve, and to the first cervical. The remainder of this second cervical is spent on the levator scapulae and the extensors of the neck and head. Generally a large branch is here sent off to join the accessorius of the eighth pair, near the superior angle of the scapula.\n\nThe Third Pair of the neck passes out between the third and fourth cervical vertebrae; having immediately a communication with the second, and sending down a branch, which being joined by a branch from the fourth cervical, forms the Phrenic nerve. This descending, enters the thorax, between the subclavian vein and artery; and then being received into a groove, formed for it in the pericardium, it has its course along this capsule of the heart, till it is lost in the middle part of the diaphragm. The right phrenic has a straight course; but the left one is obliged to make a considerable turn outwards, to go over the prominent part of the pericardium, where the point of the heart is lodged.\u2014The middle of the diaphragm scarce could have been supplied by any other nerve which could have had such a straight course as the phrenic has.\n\nThe other branches of the third cervical nerve are distributed to the muscles and teguments at the lower part of the neck and top of the shoulder.\n\nThe Fourth Cervical nerve, after sending off that branch which joins with the third to form the phrenic, and befitting twigs on the muscles and glands of the neck, runs to the arm-pit, where it meets with the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh cervicals, and First Dorsal, that escape in the interstices of the musculi scaleni, to come at the arm-pit, where they join, separate, and rejoin, in a way scarce to be rightly expressed in words; and, after giving several considerable nerves to the muscles and teguments which cover the thorax, they divide into several branches, to be distributed to all the parts of the superior extremity. Seven of these branches we shall describe under particular names.\n\n1. Scapularis runs straight to the cavitas semilunata of the upper costa of the scapula, which is a hole, in the recent subject, by a ligament being extended from one angle of the bone to the other, giving nerves in its way to the muscles of the scapula. When it has passed this hole, it supplies the supra-spinatus muscle; and then descending at the anterior root of the spine of the scapula, it is lost in the other muscles that lie on the dorsum of that bone.\n\n2. Articularis sinks downward at the axilla, to get below the neck of the head of the os humeri, and to mount again at the back-part of it; so that it almost surrounds the articulation, and is distributed to the muscles that draw the arm back, and to those that raise it up.\n\n3. Cutaneus runs down the fore-part of the arm, near the skin, to which it gives off branches; and then divides, on the inside of the fore-arm, into several nerves, which supply the teguments there, and on the palm of the hand.\n\n4. Musculo-Cutaneus, or perforans Casseri, passes through the coraco-brachialis muscle; and, after supplying the biceps flexor cubiti and brachiorad internus, passes behind the tendon of the biceps, and over the cephalic vein, to be bestowed on the teguments on the outside of the fore-arm and back of the hand.\n\n5. Muscularis has a spiral course from the axilla, under the os humeri, and backward to the external part of that bone, supplying by the way the extensor muscles of the fore-arm, to which it runs between the two brachi\u00e6 muscles, and within the supinator radii longus.\u2014At the upper part of the fore-arm, it sends off a branch, which accompanies the supinator longus till it comes near the wrist, where it passes obliquely over the radius, to be lost in the back of the hand and fingers. The principal part of this nerve pierces through the supinator radii brevis, to serve the muscles that extend the hand and fingers, whose actions are not injured when the supinator acts.\n\n6. Ulnaris is extended along the inside of the arm, to give nerves to the muscles that extend the fore-arm, and to the teguments of the elbow: Towards the lower part of the arm, it slants a little back-ward, to come at the groove behind the internal condyle of the os humeri, through which it runs to the ulna: In its course along this bone, it serves the neighbouring muscles and teguments; and as it comes near the wrist, it detaches a branch obliquely over the ulna to the back of the hand, to be lost in the convex part of several fingers. The larger part of the nerve goes straight forward to the internal side of the os pisiforme of the wrist; where it sends off a branch which sinks under the large tendons in the palm, to go across to the other side of the wrist, serving the musculi lumbricales and interossei, and at last terminating in the short muscles of the thumb and fore-finger. What remains of the ulnar nerve, after supplying the short muscles of the little finger, divides into three branches; whereof two are extended along the sides of the sheath of the tendons of the flexors of the little finger, to furnish the concave side of that finger; and the third\nthird branch is disposed in the same way upon the side of the ring-finger next to the little finger.\n\nWhen we lean or press on the internal condyle of the os humeri, the numbness and prickling we frequently feel, point out the course of this nerve.\n\n7. Radialis accompanies the humeral artery to the bending of the elbow, serving the flexors of the cubit in its way; then passing through the pronator radii teres muscle, it gives nerves to the muscles on the fore-part of the forearm, and continues its course near to the radius, bestowing branches on the circumjacent muscles. Near the wrist, it sometimes gives off a nerve, which is distributed to the back of the hand, and the convex part of the thumb, and several of the fingers, instead of the branch of the muscular. The larger part of this nerve, passing behind the annular ligament of the wrist, gives nerves to the short muscles of the thumb; and afterwards sends a branch along each side of the sheath of the tendons of the flexors of the thumb, fore-finger, mid-finger, and one branch to the side of the ring-finger, next to the middle one, to be lost on the concave side of those fingers.\n\nThough the radial nerve passes through the pronator muscle, and the muscular nerve seems to be still more unfavourably placed within the supinator brevis; yet the action of these muscles do not seem to have any effect in hindering the influence of these nerves, for the fingers or hand can be bended while pronation is performing vigorously, and they can be extended while supination is exercised.\n\nThe manner of the going off of these nerves of the fingers, both from the ulnar and radial, is, that a single branch is sent from the trunk to the side of the thumb and little finger, farther from the other fingers; and all the rest are supplied by a trunk of a nerve, which splits into two some way before it comes as far as the end of the metacarpus, to run along the sides of different fingers that are nearest to each other.\n\nIt might have been observed, that, in describing the posterior branches of the ulnar and muscular nerve, we did not mention the particular fingers, to the convex part of which they are distributed. The reason of this omission is, the uncertainty of their distribution; for though sometimes these posterior branches go to the same fingers, to the concave part of which the anterior branches of the ulnar and radial are sent, yet frequently they are distributed otherwise.\n\nThe situation of these brachial nerves in the axilla, may let us see how a weakness and atrophy may be brought on the arms by a long continued pressure of crutches, or such other hard substances on this part; and the course of them from the neck to the arm, may teach us, how much better effects vesicatory, or stimulating nervous medicines, would have, when applied to the skin, covering the transverse processes of the vertebrae of the neck, or at the axilla, than when they are put between the shoulders, or upon the spinal processes, in convulsions or palsies of the superior extremities, where a stimulus is required.\n\nThe Twelve Dorsal nerves of each side, as soon as they escape from between the vertebrae, send a branch forward to join the intercostal, by which a communication is made among them all; and they soon likewise give branches backwards to the muscles that raise the trunk of the body, their principal trunk being extended outwards, to come at the furrow in the lower edge of each rib, in which they run toward the anterior part of the thorax, between the internal and external intercostal muscles, giving off branches in their course to the muscles and teguments of the thorax.\n\nThe First dorsal, as was already observed, is particular in this, that it contributes to form the brachial nerves; and that the two branches of the intercostal, which come down to the thorax, form a considerable ganglion with it.\n\nThe Six lower dorsal nerves give branches to the diaphragm and abdominal muscles.\n\nThe Twelfth joins with the first lumbar, and bestows nerves on the musculus quadratus lumborum and iliacus internus.\n\nAs the intercostal is larger in the thorax than anywhere else, and seems to diminish gradually as it ascends and descends, there is cause to suspect that this is the trunk from which the superior and inferior pairs are sent as branches.\n\nThe Five Lumbar nerves on each side communicate with the intercostal and with each other, and give branches backwards to the loins.\n\nThe First communicates with the last dorsal, sends branches to the abdominal muscles, to the psoas and iliacus, and to the teguments and muscles on the fore-part of the thigh; while its principal branch joins with the other nerves, to form the crural nerve.\n\nThe Second Lumbar nerve passes through the psoas muscle, and is distributed nearly in the same way as the former: as is also the Third.\n\nBranches of the second, third, and fourth, make up one trunk, which runs along the fore-part of the pelvis; and, passing in the notch at the fore-part of the great hole common to the os pubis and ischium, is sent on the adductor muscles, and on the teguments on the inside of the thigh. This nerve is called the Obturator, or Posterior Crural Nerve.\n\nBy united branches from the first, second, third, and fourth lumbar nerves, a nerve is formed that runs along the psoas muscle, to escape with the external iliac vessels out of the abdomen, below the tendinous arcade of the external oblique muscle. This nerve, which is named the Anterior Crural, is distributed principally to the muscles and teguments on the fore-part of the thigh. A branch, however, of this nerve runs down the inside of the leg to the upper part of the foot, keeping near to the vena saphena; in opening of which with a lancet at the ankle, the nerve is sometimes hurt, and occasions sharp pain at the time of the operation, and numbness afterwards.\n\nThe Sixth Pair of the false Vertebrae consist each of small posterior branches, sent to the hips, and of large anterior branches.\n\nThe first, second, and third, after coming through the three upper holes in the fore-part of the os sacrum, join together with the fourth and fifth of the loins, to form\nform the largest nerve of the body, which is well known by the name of Sciatic or Ischiatic nerve: This, after sending large nerves to the different parts of the pelvis, and to the external parts of generation, and the podex, as also to the muscles of the hips, passes behind the great tuber of the os ilium, and then over the quadrigemini muscles, to run down near to the bone of the thigh at its back-part, giving off nerves to the neighbouring muscles and teguments. Some way above the ham, where it has the name of the popliteus nerve, it sends off a large branch that passes over the fibula, and sinking in among the muscles on the anterior external part of the leg, runs down to the foot, to be lost in the upper part of the larger toes, supplying the neighbouring muscles and teguments everywhere in its passage. The larger branch of the sciatic, after giving branches to the muscles and teguments about the ham and knee, and sending a large cutaneous nerve down the calf of the leg, to be lost at last on the outside of the foot and upper part of the lesser toes, sinks below the gemellus muscle, and distributes nerves to the muscles on the back of the leg; among which it continues its course, till passing behind the internal malleolus, and in the internal hollow of the os calcis, it divides into the two plantar nerves: The internal of which is distributed to the toes, in the same manner that the radial nerve of the hand serves the concave side of the thumb and fingers; and the external plantar is divided and distributed to the sole of the foot and toes, nearly as the ulnar nerve is in the palm of the hand, and in the concave part of the fingers.\n\nSeveral branches of these nerves, that serve the inferior extremities, pierce through muscles.\n\nThe Fourth, which, with the two following, is much smaller than the three superior, soon is lost in the vesica urinaria and intestinum rectum.\n\nThe Fifth comes forward between the extremity of the os sacrum and coccygis, to be distributed principally to the levatores ani.\n\nThe Sixth, which some think to be only a production of the dura mater, advances forward below the broad shoulders of the first bone of the os coccygis, and is lost in the sphincter ani and teguments covering it.\n\nThe size of the nerves of the inferior extremities seems larger proportionally than in the superior extremities; the inferior extremities having the weight of the whole body to sustain, and that frequently at a great disadvantage.\u2014What the effect is of the nerves here being injured, we see daily, when people happen, by sitting wrong, to compress the sciatic nerve, they are incapable for some time after to support themselves on the affected extremity; and this is still more remarkable in the sciatic or hip-gout, in which the member is not only weakened, but gradually shrivels and wastes.\n\nUses of the Nerves.\n\nMany experiments concur in proving, that the nerves are the instruments of sensation. As to the mode of their operation, several different theories have been given. Some suppose, that they are elastic cords, resembling fiddle-strings; and that they convey sensations to the brain by a kind of vibratory motion. Others have supposed them to be tubular, and to contain a fluid called animal spirits; and that sensation is produced by the motions and counter-motions of this fluid. Many useless volumes have been wrote upon each of these hypotheses.\u2014Another and more recent theory supposes, that the nerves are not tubular, but that they are pervaded by a subtile elastic fluid called Ether; and that sensation, &c., are occasioned by the oscillations of that fluid. A few detached and ill-digested scraps of this theory have already appeared in some temporary productions, the principal of which has been sufficiently animadverted upon under the word Ether.\n\nExplanation\n\nFig. 1.

Flat ceiled ones may be lower than those that are coved. If their plan be a square, their height should not exceed five sixths of the side, nor be less than four fifths; and when it is oblong, their height may be equal to their breadth. But coved rooms, if square, must be as high as broad; and when oblong, they may have their height equal to their breadth, more one fifth, one quarter, or even one third of the difference between the length and breadth: And galleries should at least be in height one and one third of their breadth, and at most one and a half, or one and three fifths.\n\nThe coldness of the British climate is a strong objection to high rooms; so that it is not uncommon to see the most magnificent apartments not above 15, 16, or at most 18 feet high; though the extent of the rooms would require a much more considerable elevation. But, where beauty is aimed at, this practice ought not to be imitated.\n\nWhen rooms are adorned with an entire order, the entablature should never exceed one sixth of the whole height in flat-ceiled rooms, and one fifth of the upright part in coved ones; and when there are neither columns nor pilasters, but only an entablature, its height should not be above one seventh of these heights. If the rooms be finished with a simple cornice, it should never exceed one fourteenth, nor ever less than one fifteenth part of the above-mentioned height.","sp":441,"ep":441},{"h":"OF THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITIES","t":"Each superior extremity is divided into the shoulder, arm, fore-arm, and hand.\n\nThe Shoulder consists of the clavicle and Scapula.\n\nClav\u00edcula, or collar-bone, is the long crooked bone, in figure like an Italic J, placed almost horizontally between the upper lateral part of the sternum, and what is commonly called the top of the shoulder, which, as a clavis or beam, it bears off from the trunk of the body.\n\nThe clavicle, as well as other long round bones, is larger at its two ends than in the middle. The end next to the sternum is triangular: The angle behind is considerably produced, to form a sharp ridge, to which the transverse ligament extended from one clavicle to the other is fixed.\u2014The side opposite to this is somewhat rounded.\u2014The middle of this protuberant end is as irregularly hollowed, as the cavity in the sternum for receiving it is raised; but, in a recent subject, the irregular concavities of both are supplied by a moveable cartilage, which is not only much more closely connected everywhere, by ligaments, to the circumference of the articulation, than that of the lower jaw are; but it grows to the two bones at both its internal and external ends; its substance at the internal end being soft, but very strong, and resembling the intervertebral cartilages.\n\nFrom this internal end the clavicle, for about two fifths of its length, is bent obliquely forwards and downwards. On the upper end fore-part of this curvature a small ridge is seen, with a plain rough surface before it; whence the musculus sterno-hyoideus and sterno-mastoideus have in part their origin.\u2014Near the lower angle, a small plain surface is often to be remarked, where the first rib and this bone are contiguous, and are connected by a firm ligament.\u2014From this a rough plain surface is extended outwards, where the pectoral muscle has part of its origin.\u2014Behind, the bone is made flat and rough by the insertion of the larger share of the subclavian muscle.\u2014After the clavicle begins to be bended backwards, it is round, but soon after becomes broad and thin; which shape it retains to its external end.\u2014Along the external concavity, a rough sinuosity runs, from which some part of the deltoid muscle takes its rise:\u2014Opposite to this, on the convex edge, a facetrous\nridge gives insertion to a flare of the cucullaris muscle. The upper surface of the clavicle here is flat; but the lower is hollow, for lodging the beginning of the musculus subclavius; and towards its back-part a tubercle rises, to which, and a roughness near it, the strong short thick ligament connecting this bone to the coracoid process of the scapula is fixed.\n\nThe external end of this bone is horizontally oblong, smooth, sloping at the posterior side, and tipped in a recent subject with a cartilage, for its articulation with the acromion scapulae.\n\nThe medullary arteries, having their direction obliquely outwards, enter the clavicles by one or more small passages in the middle of their back-part.\n\nThe triangular unequal interior end of each clavicle, has the cartilage above described interposed betwixt it and the irregular cavity of the sternum.\u2014The ligaments, which surround this articulation to secure it, are so short and strong, that little motion can be allowed any way; and the strong ligament that is stretched across the upper furcula of the sternum, from the posterior prominent angle of the one clavicle, to the same place of the other clavicle, serves to keep each of these bones more firmly in their place.\u2014By the assistance, however, of the moveable intervening cartilage, the clavicle can, at this joint, be raised or depressed, and moved backwards and forwards so much, as that the external end, which is at a great distance from that axis, enjoys very conspicuous motions.\n\nThe uses of the clavicles are, to keep the scapulae, and consequently all the superior extremities, from falling in and forward upon the thorax.\n\nScapula, or shoulder-blade, is the triangular bone situated on the outside of the ribs, with its longest side, called its base, towards the spinal processes of the vertebrae, and with the angle at the upper part of this side about three inches, and the lower angle at a greater distance from these processes.\u2014The back-part of the scapula has nothing but the thin ends of the serratus anterior major, and subscapularis muscles, between it and the ribs: But as this bone advances forwards, its distance from the ribs increases.\u2014The upper, or shortest side, called the superior costa of the scapula, is nearly horizontal, and parallel with the second rib.\u2014The lower side, which is named the inferior costa, is extended obliquely from the third to the eighth rib.\u2014The inferior angle of the scapula is very acute; and the upper one is near to a right angle.\u2014The body of this bone is concave towards the ribs, and convex behind, where it has the name of dorso-um.\u2014Three processes are generally reckoned to proceed from the scapula.\u2014The first is the large spine that rises from its convex surface behind, and divides it unequally.\u2014The second process stands out from the fore-part of the upper side; and, from its imaginary resemblance to a crow's beak, is named coracoideus.\u2014The third process is the whole thick bulbous fore-part of the bone.\n\nAfter thus naming the several constituent parts of the scapula, the particular description will be more easily understood.\n\nThe base, which is tipped with cartilage, is not all straight: For, above the spine, it runs obliquely forwards to the superior angle; that here it might not be too protuberant backwards, and so bruise the muscles and teguments: Into the oblique space the musculus patientiae is inserted.\u2014At the root of the spine, on the back-part of the base, a triangular plain surface is formed, by the pressure of the lower fibres of the trapezius.\u2014Below this the edge of the scapula is scabrous and rough, for the insertion of the serratus major anticus, and rhomboid muscles.\n\nThe back-part of the inferior angle is made smooth by the latissimus dorsi passing over it. This muscle also alters the direction of the inferior costa, some way forwards from this angle: and so far it is flattened behind by the origin of the teres major.\u2014As the inferior costa advances forwards, it is of considerable thickness, is slightly hollowed and made smooth behind by the teres minor, while it has a fossa formed into it below by part of the subscapularis; and between the two a ridge, with a small depression, appears, where the longus extensor cubiti has its origin.\n\nThe superior costa is very thin; and near its fore-part there is a semilunar notch, from one end of which to the other a ligament is stretched; and sometimes the bone is continued, to form one, or sometimes two holes, for the passage of the scapular blood-vessels and nerves.\u2014Immediately behind this semilunar cavity, the coraco-hyoid muscle has its rise.\u2014From the notch, to the termination of the fossa for the teres minor, the scapula is narrower than anywhere else, and supports the third process. This part has the name of cervix.\n\nThe whole dorsal of the scapula is always said to be convex; but, by reason of the raised edges that surround it, it is divided into two cavities by the spine, which is stretched from behind forwards, much nearer to the superior than to the inferior costa.\u2014The cavity above the spine is concave where the supra-spinatus muscle is lodged; while the surface of this bone below the spine, on which the infra-spinatus muscle is placed, is convex, except a fossa that runs at the side of the inferior costa.\n\nThe internal or anterior surface of this bone is hollow, except in the part above the spine, which is convex.\u2014The subscapularis muscle is extended over this surface, where it forms several ridges and intermediate depressions, commonly mistaken for prints of the ribs; they point out the interfaces of the bundles of fibres of which the subscapularis muscle is composed.\n\nThe spine rises small at the base of the scapula, and becomes higher and broader as it advances forwards.\u2014On the sides it is unequally hollowed and crooked, by the actions of the adjacent muscles.\u2014Its ridge is divided into two rough flat surfaces: Into the upper one, the trapezius muscle is inserted; and the lower one has part of the deltoid fixed to it.\u2014The end of the spine, called acromion, or top of the shoulder, is broad and flat, and is sometimes only joined to the spine by a cartilage.\u2014The anterior edge of the acromion is flat, smooth, and covered with a cartilage, for its articulation with the external end of the clavicle; and it is hollowed below, to allow a passage to the infra and supra-spinati muscles, and free motion to the os humeri.\nThe coracoid process is crooked, with its point inclining forwards; so that a hollow is left at the lower side of its root, for the passage of the infra-spinatus muscle.\n\n\u2014The end of this process is marked with three plain surfaces. Into the internal, the ferratus minor anticus is inserted: From the external, one head of the biceps flexor cubiti rises; and from the lower one, the coraco-brachialis has its origin.\u2014At the upper part of the root of this process, immediately before the femoral cavity, a smooth tubercle appears, where a ligament from the clavicle is fixed. From all the external side of this coracoid apophysis, a broad ligament goes out, which becomes narrower where it is fixed to the acromion.\n\nFrom the cervix scapulae the third process is produced. The fore-part of this is formed into a glenoid cavity, which is of the shape of the longitudinal section of an egg, being broad below, and narrow above.\u2014Between the brims of this hollow, and the fore-part of the root of the spine, a large fissure is left, for the transmission of the supra and infra-spinati muscles; and, on the upper part of these brims, we may remark a smooth surface, where the second head of the biceps flexor cubiti has its origin.\u2014The root of the supercilium is rough all round, for the firmer adhesion of the capsular ligament of the articulation, and of the cartilage which is placed on these brims, where it is thick, but becomes very thin as it is continued towards the middle of the cavity, which it lines all over.\n\nThe medullary vessels enter the scapula near the base of the spine.\n\nThe scapula and clavicle are joined by plain surfaces, tipped with cartilage; by which neither bone is allowed any considerable motion, being tightly tied down by the common capsular ligament, and by a very strong one which proceeds from the coracoid process; but divides into two before it is fixed into the clavicle, with such a direction, as either can allow this bone to have a small rotation, in which its posterior edge turns more backwards, while the anterior one rises farther forwards; or it can yield to the fore-part of the scapula moving downwards, while the back-part of it is drawn upwards; in both which cases, the oblong smooth articulated surfaces of the clavicle and scapula are not in the same plane, but stand a little transversely, or across each other, and thereby preserve this joint from luxations, to which it would be subject, if either of the bones was to move on the other perpendicularly up and down, without any rotation.\u2014The scapula is connected to the head, os hyoides, vertebrae, ribs, and arm-bone, by muscles, that have one end fastened to these bones, and the other to the scapula, which can move it upwards, downwards, backwards, or forwards; by the quick succession of these motions, its whole body is carried in a circle.\n\nThe use of the scapula is, to serve as a fulcrum to the arm; and, by altering its position on different occasions, to allow always the head of the os humeri a right situated socket to move in; and thereby to assist and to enlarge greatly the motions of the superior extremity, and to afford the muscles which rise from it more advantageous actions, by altering their directions to the bone which they are to move.\n\nThe Arm has only one bone, best known by the Latin name of os humeri; which is long, round, and nearly straight.\n\nThe upper end of this bone is formed into a large, round, smooth head, whose middle point is not in a straight line with the axis of the bone, but stands obliquely backwards from it.\u2014The extent of the head is distinguished by a circular fossa surrounding its base, where the head is united to the bone, and the capsular ligament of the joint is fixed.\u2014Below the fore-part of its base two tubercles stand out: The smallest one, which is situated most to the inside, has the tendon of the subscapularis muscle inserted into it.\u2014The larger more external protuberance is divided, at its upper part, into three smooth plain surfaces; into the anterior of which, the musculus supra-spinatus; into the middle or largest, the infra-spinatus; into the one behind, the teres minor, is inserted.\u2014Between these two tubercles, exactly in the fore part of the bone, a deep long fossa is formed, for lodging the tendinous head of the biceps flexor cubiti.\u2014On each side of this fossa, as it descends in the os humeri, a rough ridge, gently flattened in the middle, runs from the roots of the tubercles.\u2014The tendon of the pectoral muscle is fixed into the anterior of these ridges, and the latissimus dorsi, and teres major, are inserted into the internal one.\u2014A little behind the lower end of this last, another rough ridge may be observed, where the coraco-brachialis is inserted.\u2014From the back-part of the root of the largest tubercle, a ridge also is continued, from which the brevis extensor cubiti rises.\u2014This bone is flattened on the inside, about its middle, by the belly of the biceps flexor cubiti.\u2014In the middle of this plain surface, the entry of the medullary artery is seen slanting obliquely downwards.\u2014At the fore-side of this plane, the bone rises in a sort of ridge, which is rough, and often has a great many small holes in it, where the tendon of the strong deltoid muscle is inserted; on each side of which the bone is smooth and flat, where the brachioeus internus rises. The exterior of these two flat surfaces is the largest; behind it a superficial spiral channel, formed by the muscular nerve and the vessels that accompany it, runs from behind forwards and downwards.\u2014The body of the os humeri is flattened behind by the extensors of the fore-arm.\u2014Near the lower end of this bone, a large sharp ridge is extended on its outside, from which the musculus spinator radii longus, and the longest head of the extensor carpi radialis rise.\u2014Opposite to this, there is another small ridge, to which the aponeurotic tendon, that gives origin to the fibres of the internal and external brachioei muscles, is fixed; and from a little depression on the fore-side of it, the pronator radii teres rises.\n\nThe body of the os humeri becomes gradually broader towards the lower end, where it has several processes; at the roots of which there is a cavity before, and another behind. The anterior is divided, by a ridge, into two; the external, which is the least, receives the end of the radius; and the internal receives the coronoid process of the ulna in the flexion of the fore-arm, while the posterior deep triangular cavity lodges the olecranon in the extensions of that member.\u2014The sides of\nthe posterior cavity are stretched out into two processes, one on each side: These are called condyles; from each of which a strong ligament goes out to the bones of the fore-arm.\u2014The external condyle, which has an oblique direction also forwards in respect of the internal, when the arm is in the most natural posture, is equally broad, and has an obtuse smooth head rising from it forwards.\u2014From the rough part of the condyle, the inferior head of the bicipitis, the extensor digitorum communis, extensor carpi ulnaris, anconeus, and some part of the supinator radii brevis, take their rise; and on the smooth head the upper end of the radius plays.\u2014Immediately on the outside of this, there is a sinuosity made by the shorter head of the bicipitis muscle, upon which the muscular nerve is placed.\u2014The internal condyle is more pointed and protuberant than the external, to give origin to some part of the flexor carpi radialis, pronator radii teres, palmaris longus, flexor digitorum sublimis, and flexor carpi ulnaris.\u2014Between the two condyles, is the trochlea or pully, which consists of two lateral protuberances, and a middle cavity, that are smooth, and covered with cartilage.\u2014When the fore-arm is extended, the tendon of the internal brachioradialis muscle is lodged in the fore-part of the cavity of this pully.\u2014The external protuberance, which is less than the other, has a sharp edge behind; but forwards, this ridge is obtuse, and only separated from the little head, already described, by a small fossa, in which the joined edges of the ulna and radius move.\u2014The internal protuberance of the pully is largest and highest; and therefore, in the motions of the ulna upon it, that bone would be inclined outwards, was it not supported by the radius on that side.\u2014Between this internal protuberance and condyle, a sinuosity may be remarked, where the ulnar nerve passes.\n\nThe round head at the upper end of this bone is articulated with the glenoid cavity of the scapula; which being superficial, and having long ligaments, allows the arm a free and extensive motion.\n\nThe motions which the arm enjoys by this articulation, are to every side; and by the succession of these different motions, a circle may be described. Besides which, the bone performs a small rotation round its own axis.\n\nThe Fore-arm consists of two long bones, the ulna and radius; whose situation, in respect of each other, is oblique in the least straining or most natural posture; that is, the ulna is not directly behind, nor on the outside of the radius, but in a middle situation between these two, and the radius crosses it.\u2014In the following description, by the term posterior is meant that part which is in the same direction with the back of the hand; by anterior, that answering to the palm; by internal, that on the same side with the thumb; by external, the side nearest the little finger.\n\nUlna, so named from its being used as a measure, is the longest of the two bones of the fore-arm, and situated on the outside of the radius.\n\nAt the upper end of the ulna are two processes.\u2014The posterior is the largest, and formed like a hook, whose concave surface moves upon the pully of the os humeri, and is called olecranon, or top of the cubit.\u2014The convex back-part of it is rough and scabrous, where the longus, brevis, and brachioradialis externus, are inserted. The olecranon makes it unnecessary that the tendons of the extensor muscles should pass over the end of the os humeri; which would have been of ill consequence in the great flexions of this joint, or when any considerable external force is applied to this part.\u2014The anterior process is not so large, nor does it reach so high as the one behind; but is sharper at its end, and therefore is named coronoid.\u2014Between these two processes, a large semicircular or sigmoid concavity is left; the surface of which, on each side of a middle rising, is flatting, and exactly adapted to the pully of the bone of the arm.\u2014Across the middle of it, there is a small sinuosity for lodging mucilaginous glands; where, as well as in a small hollow on the internal side of it, the cartilage that lines the rest of its surface is wanting.\u2014Round the brims of this concavity the bone is rough, where the capsular ligament of the joint is implanted.\u2014Immediately below the olecranon, on the back-part of the ulna, a flat, triangular, spongy surface appears, on which we commonly lean.\u2014At the internal side of this, there is a larger hollow surface, where the musculus anconeous is lodged; and the ridge at the inside of this gives rise to the musculus supinator radii brevis.\u2014Between the top of the ridge and the coronoid process, is the semilunated smooth cavity, lined with cartilage, in which, and a ligament extended from the one to the other end of this cavity, the round head of the radius plays.\u2014Immediately below it, a rough hollow gives lodging to mucilaginous glands.\u2014Below the root of the coronoid process, this bone is scabrous and unequal, where the brachioradialis internus is inserted.\u2014On the outside of that, we observe a smooth concavity, where the beginning of the flexor digitorum profundus sprouts out.\n\nThe body of the ulna is triangular.\u2014The internal angle is very sharp where the ligament that connects the two bones is fixed;\u2014the sides, which make this angle, are flat and rough, by the action and adhesion of the many muscles which are situated here.\u2014At the distance of one third of the length of the ulna from the top, in its fore-part, the passage of the medullary vessels is to be remarked slanting upwards.\u2014The external side of this bone is smooth, somewhat convex, and the angles at each edge of it are blunted by the pressure of the muscles equally disposed about them.\n\nAs this bone descends, it becomes gradually smaller; so that its lower end terminates in a little head, standing on a small neck.\u2014Towards the fore but outer part of which last, an oblique ridge runs, that gives rise to the pronator radii quadratus.\u2014The head is round, smooth, and covered with a cartilage on its internal side, to be received into the semilunar cavity of the radius; while a styloid process rises from its outside, to which is fixed a strong ligament that is extended to the os cuneiforme and pisiforme of the wrist.\u2014Between the back-part of that internal smooth side and this process, a sinuosity is left for the tendon of the extensor carpi ulnaris.\u2014On the fore-part of the root of the process, such another depression may be remarked for the passage of the ulnar artery and nerve.\u2014The end of the bone is smooth, and covered with a cartilage.\u2014Between it and the bones of the\nthe wrist, a double concave movable cartilage is interposed; which is a continuation of the cartilage that covers the lower end of the radius, and is connected loosely to the root of the styloid process, and to the rough cavity there, in which mucilaginous glands are lodged.\n\nThe ulna is articulated above with the lower end of the os humeri, where these bones have depressions and protuberances corresponding to each other, so as to allow an easy and secure extension of the fore-arm to almost a straight line with the arm, and flexion to a very acute angle; but, by the slanting position of the pulley, the lower part of the fore-arm is turned outwards in the extension, and inwards in the flexion; and a very small kind of rotation is likewise allowed in all positions, especially when the ligaments are most relaxed by the fore-arm being in a middle degree of flexion.\u2014The ulna is also articulated with the radius and carpus, in a manner to be related afterwards.\n\nRadius, so called from its imagined resemblance to a spoke of a wheel, is the bone placed at the inside of the fore-arm. Its upper end is formed into a circular little head, which is hollowed for an articulation with the tubercle at the side of the pulley of the os humeri; and the half of the round circumference of the head next to the ulna is smooth, and covered with a cartilage, in order to be received into the semilunated cavity of that bone.\u2014Below the head, the radius is much smaller; therefore this part is named its cervix, which is made round by the action of the supinator radii brevis.\u2014At the external root of this neck, a tubercle process rises; into the outer part of which the biceps flexor cubiti is inserted.\u2014From this a ridge runs downwards and inwards, where the supinator radii brevis is inserted; and a little below, and behind this ridge, there is a rough scabrous surface, where the pronator radii teres is fixed.\n\nThe body of the radius is not straight, but convex on its internal and posterior surfaces; where it is also made round by the equal pressure of the circumjacent muscles, particularly of the extensors of the thumb; but the surfaces next to the ulna are flattened and rough, for the origin of the muscles of the hand; and both terminate in a common sharp spine, to which the strong ligament extended between the two bones of the fore-arm is fixed. A little below the beginning of the plain surface, on its fore-part, where the flexor muscle of the last joint of the thumb takes its origin, the passage of the medullary vessels is seen slanting upwards.\u2014The radius becomes broader and flatter towards the lower end, especially on its fore-part, where its pronator quadratus muscle is situated.\n\nThe lower end of the radius is larger than the superior; though not in such a disproportion as the upper end of the ulna is larger than its lower end.\u2014Its back-part has a flat strong ridge in the middle, and fossae on each side.\u2014In a small groove immediately on the outside of this ridge, the tendon of the extensor tertii interosseus pollicis plays.\u2014In a large one beyond this, the tendons of the indicator and of the common extensor muscles of the fingers pass.\u2014Contiguous to the ulna, there is a small depression made by the extensor minimi digiti,\n\n\u2014On the outside of the ridge there is a broad depression, which seems again subdivided, where the two tendons of the bicipital, or extensor carpi radialis, are lodged.\u2014The internal side of this end of the radius is also hollowed by the extensors of the first and second joint of the thumb; immediately above which, a little rough surface shows where the supinator radii longus is inserted.\u2014The ridges at the sides of the grooves, in which the tendons play, have an annular ligament fixed to them, by which the several sheaths for the tendons are formed.\u2014The fore-part of this end of the radius is also depressed, where the flexors of the fingers and flexor carpi radialis pass.\u2014The external side is formed into a semilunated smooth cavity, lined with a cartilage, for receiving the lower end of the ulna.\u2014The lowest part of the radius is formed into an oblong cavity; in the middle of which is a small transverse rising, gently hollowed, for lodging mucilaginous glands; while the rising itself is inflected into the conjunction of the two bones of the wrist that are received into the cavity.\u2014The internal side of this articulation is fenced by a remarkable process of the radius, from which a ligament goes out to the wrist, as the styloid process of the ulna with its ligament guards it on the outside.\n\nThe ends of both the bones of the fore-arm being thicker than the middle, there is a considerable distance between the bodies of these bones; in the larger part of which a strong tendinous, but thin ligament, is extended, to give a large enough surface for the origin of the numerous fibres of the muscles situated here, that are so much sunk between the bones, as to be protected from injuries, which they would otherwise be exposed to.\n\nAs the head of the radius receives the tubercle of the os humeri, it is not only bended and extended along with the ulna, but may be moved round its axis in any position; and that this motion round its axis may be sufficiently large, the ligament of the articulation is extended farther down than ordinary on the neck of this bone, before it is connected to it; and it is very thin at its upper and lower part, but makes a firm ring in the middle.\u2014This bone is also joined to the ulna by a double articulation; for above, a tubercle of the radius plays in a socket of the ulna; whilst below, the radius gives the socket, and the ulna the tubercle: But then the motion performed in these two is very different; for, at the upper end, the radius does no more than turn round its axis; while, at the lower end, it moves in a sort of cycloid upon the round part of the ulna; and as the hand is articulated and firmly connected here with the radius, they must move together.\u2014When the palm is turned uppermost, the radius is said to perform the supination; when the back of the hand is above, it is said to be prone.\n\nThe Hand comprehends all from the joint of the wrist to the points of the fingers. Its back-part is convex, for greater firmness and strength; and it is concave before, for containing more surely and conveniently such bodies as we take hold of.\n\nThe hand is commonly divided into the carpus, metacarpus, and fingers.\n\nThe Carpus is composed of eight small spongy bones, situated at the upper part of the hand, viz. the\nos scaphoides, lunare, cuneiforme, pisiforme, trapezium, trapezoides, magnum, unciforme.\n\nThe scaphoides is situated most internally of those that are articulated with the fore-arm.\u2014The lunare is immediately on the outside of the former.\u2014The cuneiforme is placed still more externally, but does not reach so high up as the other two.\u2014The pisiforme stands forwards into the palm from the cuneiforme.\u2014The trapezium is the first of the second row, and is situated betwixt the scaphoides and first joint of the thumb.\u2014The trapezoides is immediately on the outside of the trapezium.\u2014The os magnum is still more external.\u2014The unciforme is farther to the side of the little finger.\n\nOs scaphoides is the largest of the eight except one. It is convex above, concave and oblong below; from which small resemblance of a boat it has got its name.\u2014Its smooth convex surface is divided by a rough middle fossa, which runs obliquely across it.\u2014The upper largest division is articulated with the radius.\u2014Into the fossa the common ligament of the joint of the wrist is fixed; and the lower division is joined to the trapezium and trapezoides.\u2014The concavity receives more than an half of the round head of the os magnum.\u2014The external side of this hollow is formed into a semilunar plane, to be articulated with the following bone.\u2014The internal, posterior, and anterior edges are rough, for fixing the ligaments that connect it to the surrounding bones.\n\nOs lunare has a smooth convex upper surface, by which it is articulated with the radius.\u2014The internal side, which gives the name to the bone, is in the form of a crescent, and is joined with the scaphoid;\u2014the lower surface is hollow, for receiving part of the head of the os magnum.\u2014On the outside of this cavity is another smooth, but narrow oblong sinuosity, for receiving the upper end of the os unciforme:\u2014On the outside of which a small round convexity is found, for its connection with the os cuneiforme. Between the great convexity above, and the first deep inferior cavity, there is a rough fossa, in which the circular ligament of the joint of the wrist is fixed.\n\nOs cuneiforme is broader above, and towards the back of the hand, than it is below and forwards: which gives it the resemblance of a wedge.\u2014The superior slightly convex surface is included in the joint of the wrist, being opposed to the lower end of the ulna.\u2014Below this, the cuneiform bone has a rough fossa, wherein the ligament of the articulation of the wrist is fixed.\u2014On the internal side of this bone, where it is contiguous to the os lunare, it is smooth and slightly concave.\u2014Its lower surface, where it is contiguous to the os unciforme, is oblong, somewhat spiral, and concave.\u2014Near the middle of its anterior surface, a circular plane appears, where the os pisiforme is sustained.\n\nOs pisiforme is almost spherical, except one circular plane, or slightly hollow surface; which is covered with cartilage for its motion on the cuneiforme bone, from which its whole rough body is prominent forwards into the palm; having the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and a ligament from the styloid process of the ulna, fixed to its upper part; the transverse ligament of the wrist is connected to its internal side; ligaments extended to the unciiform bone, and to the os metacarpi of the little finger, are attached to its lower part; the abductor minimi digiti has its origin from its fore-part; and, at the internal side of it, a small depression is formed, for the passage of the ulnar nerve.\n\nTrapezium has four unequal sides and angles in its back-part, from which it has got its name.\u2014Above, its surface is smooth, slightly hollowed, and semicircular, for its conjunction with the os scaphoides.\u2014Its external side is an oblong concave square, for receiving the following bone.\u2014The inferior surface is formed into a pulley; the two protuberant sides of which are external and internal. On this pulley the first bone of the thumb is moved.\u2014At the external side of the external protuberance, a small oblong smooth surface is formed by the os metacarpi indicis.\u2014The fore-part of the trapezium is prominent in the palm, and, near to the external side, has a sinuosity in it, where the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis is lodged; on the ligamentous sheath of which the tendon of the flexor tertii intermodii pollicis plays: And still more externally the bone is scarious, where the transverse ligament of the wrist is connected, the abductor and flexor primi intermodii pollicis have their origin, and ligaments go out to the first bone of the thumb.\n\nOs trapezoides, so called from the irregular quadrangular figure of its back-part, is the smallest bone of the wrist, except the pisiforme.\u2014The figure of it is an irregular cube.\u2014It has a small hollow surface above, by which it joins the scaphoides; a long convex one internally, where it is contiguous to the trapezium; a small external one, for its conjunction with the os magnum; and an inferior convex surface, the edges of which are however so raised before and behind, that a sort of pulley is formed, where it sustains the os metacarpi indicis.\n\nOs magnum, so called because it is the largest bone of the carpus, is oblong, having four quadrangular sides, with a round upper end, and a triangular plain one below.\u2014The round head is divided by a small rising, opposite to the connection of the os scaphoides and lunare, which together form the cavity for receiving it.\u2014On the inside, a short plain surface joins the os magnum to the trapezoides.\u2014On the outside is a long narrow concave surface, where it is contiguous to the os unciforme.\u2014The lower end, which sustains the metacarpal bone of the middle finger, is triangular, slightly hollowed, and farther advanced on the internal side than on the external, having a considerable oblong depression made on the advanced inside by the metacarpal bone of the fore-finger; and generally there is a small mark of the os metacarpi digiti annularis on its external side.\n\nOs unciforme has got its name from a thin broad process that stands out from it forwards into the palm, and is hollow on its inside, for affording passage to the tendons of the flexors of the fingers. To this process also the transverse ligament is fixed, that binds down and defends these tendons; and the flexor and abductor muscles of the little finger have part of their origin from it.\u2014The upper plain surface is small, convex, and joined with the os lunare.\u2014The internal side is long, and slightly convex, adapted to the contiguous os magnum:\nThe external surface is oblique, and irregularly convex, to be articulated with the cuneiform bone:\u2014The lower end is divided into two concave surfaces; the external is joined with the metacarpal bone of the little finger, and the internal one is fitted to the metacarpal bone of the ring-finger.\n\nThe uses of the carpus are, to serve as a base to the hand, to protect its tendons, and to afford it a free large motion.\n\nMetacarpus consists of four bones, which sustain the fingers.\u2014Each bone is long and round, with its ends larger than its body.\u2014The upper end, which some call the base, is flat and oblong, without any considerable head or cavity; but it is however somewhat hollowed, for the articulation with the carpus: It is made flat and smooth on the sides where these bones are contiguous to each other.\u2014Their bodies are flattened on their back-part by the tendons of the extensors of the fingers.\u2014The anterior surface of these bodies is a little concave, especially in their middle; along which a sharp ridge stands out, which separates the musculi interossei placed on each side of these bones, which are there made flat and plain by these muscles.\n\nTheir lower ends are raised into large oblong smooth heads, whose greatest extent is forwards from the axis of the bone.\u2014At the fore-part of each side of the root of each of these heads, one or two tubercles stand out, for fixing the ligaments that go from one metacarpal bone to another, to preserve them from being drawn asunder:\u2014Round the heads a rough ring may be remarked, for the capsular ligaments of the first joints of the fingers to be fixed to; and both sides of these heads are flat, by pressing on each other.\n\nThe concavity on the fore-part of these metacarpal bones, and the placing their basis on the arched carpus, cause them to form a hollow in the palm of the hand, which is useful often to us.\u2014The spaces between them lodge muscles, and their small motion makes them fit supporters for the fingers to play on.\n\nThough the os metacarpi fo far agree, yet they may be distinguished from each other by the following marks.\n\nThe os metacarpi indicis is generally the longest.\u2014Its base, which is articulated with the os trapezoides, is hollow in the middle.\u2014The small ridge on the internal side of this oblong cavity is smaller than the one opposite to it, and is made flat on the side by the trapezium.\u2014The exterior ridge is also smooth, and flat on its outside, for its conjunction with the os magnum; immediately below which, a semicircular smooth flat surface shews the articulation of this to the second metacarpal bone.\u2014The back-part of this base is flattened, where the long head of the extensor carpi radialis is inserted; and its fore-part is prominent, where the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis is fixed.\u2014The external side of the body of this bone is more hollowed by the action of muscles, than the internal.\u2014The tubercle at the internal root of its head is larger than the external.\u2014Its base is so firmly fixed to the bone it is connected with, that it has no motion.\n\nOs metacarpi medii digiti is generally the second in length.\u2014Its base is a broad superficial cavity, slanting outwards; the internal posterior angle of which is so prominent, as to have the appearance of a process.\u2014The internal side of this base is made plain in the same way as the external side of the former bone, while its external side has two hollow circular surfaces, for joining the third metacarpal bone; and between these surfaces there is a rough fossa, for the adhesion of a ligament, and lodging mucilaginous glands.\u2014The shorter head of the bicornis is inserted into the back-part of this base.\u2014The two sides of this bone are almost equally flattened; only the ridge on the fore-part of the body inclines outwards.\u2014The tubercles at the fore-part of the root of the head are equal.\u2014The motion of this bone is very little more than the first metacarpal one has; and therefore these two firmly resist bodies pressed against them by the thumb, or fingers, or both.\n\nOs metacarpi digitii annulare is shorter than the second metacarpal bone.\u2014Its base is semicircular and convex, for its conjunction with the os unciforme.\u2014On its internal side are two smooth convexities, and a middle fossa, adapted to the second metacarpal bone.\u2014The external side has a triangular smooth concave surface to join it with the fourth one. The anterior ridge of its body is situated more to the out than to the in-side.\u2014The tubercles near the head are equal.\u2014The motion of this third metacarpal bone is greater than the motion of the second.\n\nOs metacarpi minimi digiti is the smallest and sharpest.\u2014Its base is irregularly convex, and rises slanting outwards.\u2014Its internal side is exactly adapted to the third metacarpal bone.\u2014The external has no smooth surface, because it is not contiguous to any other bone; but it is prominent where the extensor carpi ulnaris is inserted.\u2014As this metacarpal bone is furnished with a proper moving muscle, has the plainest articulation, is most loosely connected and least confined, it not only enjoys a much larger motion than any of the rest, but draws the third bone with it, when the palm of the hand is to be made hollow by its advancement forwards, and by the prominence of the thumb opposite to it.\n\nThe Thumb and four Fingers are each composed of three long bones.\n\nThe thumb is situated obliquely in respect of the fingers, neither opposite directly to them, nor in the same plane with them.\u2014All its bones are much thicker and stronger in proportion to their length, than the bones of the fingers are: Which was extremely necessary, since the thumb counteracts all the fingers.\n\nThe first bone of the thumb has its base adapted to the double pulley of the trapezium.\u2014The edge at the fore-part of this base is produced farther than any other part; and round the back-part of the base a rough fossa may be seen, for the connection of the ligaments of this joint.\u2014The body and head of this bone are of the same shape as the os metacarpi: only that the body is shorter, and the head flatter, with the tubercles at the fore-part of its root larger.\n\nThe articulation of the upper end of this bone is uncommon: For though it has protuberances and depressions adapted to the double pulley of the trapezium; yet it enjoys a circular motion, as the joints do where a\nround head of one bone plays in the orbicular socket of another; only it is somewhat more confined and less expedient, but stronger and more secure, than such joints generally are.\n\nThe second bone of the thumb has a large base formed into an oblong cavity, whose greatest length is from one side to the other.\u2014Round it several tubercles may be remarked, for the insertion of ligaments.\u2014Its body is convex, or a half-round behind; but flat before, for lodging the tendon of the long flexor of the thumb, which is tied down by ligamentous sheaths that are fixed on each side to the angle at the edge of this flat surface.\n\nThe articulation and motion of the upper end of this second bone is as singular as that of the former.\u2014For its cavity being joined to the round head of the first bone, it would seem at first view to enjoy motion in all directions; yet, because of the strength of its lateral ligaments, oblong figure of the joint itself, and mobility of the first joint, it only allows flexion and extension; and these are generally much confined.\n\nThe third bone of the thumb is the smallest, with a large base, whose greatest extent is from one side to the other.\u2014This base is formed into two cavities and a middle protuberance, to be adapted to the pulley of the former bone.\u2014Its body is rounded behind; but is flatter than in the former bone, for sustaining the nail.\u2014It is flat and rough before, by the insertion of the flexor tertii internodii.\u2014This bone becomes gradually smaller, till near the lower end, where it is a little enlarged, and has an oval scabrous edge.\n\nThe motion of this third bone is confined to flexion and extension.\n\nThe orderly disposition of the bones of the fingers into three rows, has made them generally obtain the name of three phalanges.\u2014All of them have half-round convex surfaces, covered with an aponeurosis, formed by the tendons of the extensors, lumbricales, and interossei, and placed directly backwards, for their greater strength; and their flat concave part is forwards, for taking hold more surely, and for lodging the tendons of the flexor muscles.\u2014The ligaments for keeping down these tendons are fixed to the angles that are between the convex and concave sides.\n\nThe bones of the first phalanx of the fingers answer to the description of the second bone of the thumb: only that the cavity in their base is not so oblong; nor is their motion on the metacarpal bones so much confined; for they can be moved laterally or circularly, but have no rotation, or a very small degree of it, round their axis.\n\nThe second bone of the fingers has its base formed into two lateral cavities, and a middle protuberance; while the lower end has two lateral protuberances, and a middle cavity; therefore it is joined at both ends in the same manner, which none of the bones of the thumb are.\n\nThe third bone differs nothing from the description of the third bone of the thumb, excepting in the general distinguishing marks; and therefore the second and third phalanx of the fingers enjoy only flexion and extension.\n\nAll the difference of the phalanges of the several fingers consists in their magnitude.\u2014The bones of the middle-finger being the longest and largest.\u2014Those of the fore-finger come next to that in thickness, but not in length, for those of the ring-finger are a little longer. The little finger has the smallest bones. Which disposition is the best contrivance for holding the largest bodies; because the longest fingers are applied to the middle largest periphery of such substances as are of a spherical figure.\n\nThe uses of all the parts of our superior extremities are so evident in the common actions of life, that it is needless to enumerate them here; and therefore we shall proceed to the last part of the skeleton.","sp":215,"ep":222},{"h":"OF THE TRUNK","t":"The Trunk consists of the spine, pelvis, and thorax.\n\nThe Spine is the long pile of bones extended from the condyles of the occiput to the end of the rump. It somewhat resembles two unequal pyramids joined in a common base. It is not, however, straight; for its upper part being drawn backwards by strong muscles, it gradually advances forwards, to support the oesophagus, vessels of the head, &c. Then it turns backwards, to make place enough for the heart and lungs. It is next bended forwards, to support the viscera of the abdomen. It afterwards turns backwards, for the enlargement of the pelvis. And, lastly, it is reflected forwards, for sustaining the lowest great gut.\n\nThe spine is commonly divided into true and false vertebrae; the former constituting the long upper pyramid, which has its base base below, while the false vertebra make the shorter lower pyramid, whose base is above.\n\nThe True Vertebrae are the twenty-four upper bones of the spine, on which the several motions of the trunk of our bodies are performed; from which use they have justly got their name.\n\nEach of these vertebrae is composed of its body and processes.\n\nThe body is the thick spongy fore-part, which is convex before, concave backwards, horizontal and plain in most of them above and below.\u2014Numerous small holes, especially on the fore and back-part of their surface, give passage to their vessels, and allow the ligaments to enter their substance.\u2014The edges of the body of each vertebra are covered, especially at the fore-part, with a ring of bone firmer and more solid than the substance of the body anywhere else. These rings are of great use in preventing the spongy bodies from being broken in the motions of the trunk.\n\nBetween the bodies of each two adjoining vertebra, a substance between the nature of ligament and cartilage is interposed; which seems to consist of concentrical curve fibres, when it is cut horizontally; but when it is divided perpendicularly, the fibres appear oblique and decussating each other.\u2014The outer part of the intervertebral ligaments is the most solid and hard; and they gradually become softer till they are almost in the form of a glairy liquor in the centre; and therefore these substances were not improperly called mucous ligaments by the ancients. The external fibrous part of each is capable of being greatly extended, and of being compressed into a very small space, whilst the middle fluid part is incompressible, or nearly so; and the parts of this ligament between the circumference and centre approach in their properties to either, in proportion to their more solid or\nor more fluid texture. The middle point is therefore a fulcrum or pivot, on which the motion of a ball and socket may be made, with such a gradual yielding of the substance of the ligament, in whichever direction our spines are moved, as saves the body from violent shocks, and their dangerous consequences.\u2014This ligamento-cartilaginous substance is firmly fixed to the horizontal surfaces of the bodies of the vertebrae, to connect them, in which it is assisted by a strong membranous ligament, which lines all their concave surface, and by still a stronger ligament, that covers all their anterior convex surface.\n\nFrom each side of the body of each vertebra, a bony bridge is produced backwards, and to a side; from the posterior end of which, one flanking process rises and another descends; the smooth, and what is generally the flattest side of each of these four processes, which are called the oblique, is covered with a smooth cartilage; and the two lower ones of each vertebra, are fitted to, and articulated with the two upper or ascending oblique processes of the vertebra below, having their articular ligaments fixed into the rough line round their edges.\n\nFrom between the oblique processes of each side the vertebra is stretched out laterally into a process that is named transverse.\n\nFrom the back-part of the roots of the two oblique, and of the transverse process of each side, a broad oblique bony plate is extended backwards, where these meet, the seventh process of the vertebra takes its rise, and stands out backwards: This being generally sharp pointed, and narrow edged, has therefore been called spinal process; from which this whole chain of bones has got its name.\n\nBesides the common ligament which lines all the internal surface of the spinal processes, as well as of the bodies, there are particular ligaments that connect the bony bridges and processes of the contiguous vertebrae together.\n\nThe substance of the processes is considerably stronger and firmer, and has a thicker external plate than the bodies of the vertebrae have.\n\nThe seven processes form a concavity at their fore-part, which, joined to the one at the back-part of the bodies, makes a great hole, and the holes of all the vertebrae form a long large conduit, for containing the spinal marrow.\u2014In the upper and lower edge of each lateral bridge, there is a notch. These are so adapted to each other in the contiguous vertebrae, as to form a round hole in each side between each two vertebrae, through which the nerves that proceed from the spinal marrow and its blood-vessels pass.\n\nThe articulations then of these true vertebrae are plainly double; for their bodies are joined by the intervening cartilage above described, and their oblique processes being tipped with cartilages, are so connected by their ligaments, as to allow a small degree of motion to all sides.\n\nThe true vertebrae serve to give us an erect posture; to allow sufficient and secure motion to the head, neck, and trunk of the body, and to support and defend the bowels, and other soft parts.\n\nThough the true vertebrae agree in the general structure which we have hitherto described; yet because of several specialities proper to a particular number, they are commonly divided into three classes, viz. cervical, dorsal, and lumbar.\n\nThe cervical are the seven uppermost vertebrae; which are distinguished from the rest by these marks.\u2014Their bodies are smaller and more solid than any others, and flattened on the fore-part, to make way for the oesophagus; or rather this flat figure is owing to the pressure of that pipe, and to the action of the longi colli and anterior recti muscles.\u2014They are also flat behind, where small processes rise, to which the internal ligaments are fixed.\u2014The upper surface of the body of each vertebra is made hollow, by a flanking thin process which is raised on each side.\u2014The lower surface is also excavated, but in a different manner; for here the posterior edge is raised a little; and the one before is produced a considerable way.\u2014Hence we see how the cartilages between those bones are firmly connected, and their articulations are secure.\n\nThe cartilages between these vertebrae are thick, especially at their fore-part; which is one reason why the vertebrae advance forward as they descend, and have larger motion.\n\nThe oblique processes of these bones of the neck more justly deserve that name than those of any other vertebrae. They are situated flanking; the upper ones having their smooth and almost flat surfaces facing obliquely backwards and upwards, while the inferior oblique processes have their surfaces facing obliquely forwards and downwards.\n\nThe transverse processes of these vertebrae are framed in a different manner from those of any other bones of the spine: For besides the common transverse process rising from between the oblique processes of each side, there is a second one that comes out from the side of the body of each vertebra; and these two processes, after leaving a circular hole for the passage of the cervical artery and vein, unite, and are considerably hollowed at their upper part, with rising sides, to protect the nerves that pass in the hollow; and at last each side terminates in an obtuse point, for the insertion of muscles.\n\nThe spinal processes of these cervical bones stand nearly straight backwards, are shorter than those of any other vertebrae, and are forked or double at their ends; and hence allow a more convenient insertion to muscles.\n\nSo far most of the cervical vertebrae agree; but they have some particular differences, which oblige us to consider them separately.\n\nThe first, from its use of supporting the head, has the name of atlas; and is also called epistrophoea, from the motion it performs on the second.\n\nThe atlas, contrary to all the other vertebrae of the spine, has no body; but, instead of it, there is a bony arch.\u2014In the convex fore-part of which, a small rising appears, where the musculi longi colli are inserted; and, on each side of this protuberance, a small cavity may be observed, where the recti interni minores take their rise.\u2014The upper and lower parts of the arch are rough and unequal, where the ligaments that connect\nconnect this vertebra to the os occipitis, and to the second vertebra, are fixed.\u2014The back-part of the arch is concave, smooth, and covered with a cartilage, in a recent subject, to receive the tooth-like process of the second vertebra.\u2014In a first vertebra, from which the second has been separated, this hollow makes the passage for the spinal marrow to seem much larger than it really is: On each side of it a small rough sinuosity may be remarked, where the ligaments going to the sides of the tooth-like process of the following vertebra are fastened; and on each side, a small rough protuberance and depression is observable, where the transverse ligament, which secures the tooth-like process in the sinuosity, is fixed, and hinders that process from injuring the medulla spinalis in the flexions of the head.\n\nThe atlas has as little spinal process as body; but instead thereof, there is a large bony arch, that the muscles which pass over this vertebra at that place might not be hurt in extending the head.\n\nThe superior oblique processes of this atlas are large, oblong, hollow, and more horizontal than in any other vertebra.\u2014They rise more in their external than internal brim; by which their articulations with the condyloid of the os occipitis are firmer.\u2014Under the external edge of each of these oblique processes, is the fossa, or deep open channel, in which the vertebral arteries make the circular turn, as they are about to enter the great foramen of the occipital bone, and where the tenth pair of nerves goes out.\u2014The inferior oblique processes extending from within outwards and downwards, are large, concave, and circular. So that this vertebra, contrary to the other six, receives the bones with which it is articulated both above and below.\n\nThe transverse processes here are not much hollowed or forked, but are longer and larger than those of any other vertebra of the neck, for the origin and insertion of several muscles.\n\nThe hole for the spinal marrow is larger in this than in any other vertebra, not only on account of the marrow being larger here, but also to prevent its being hurt by the motions of this vertebra on the second one.\u2014This large hole, and the long transverse processes, make this the broadest vertebra of the neck.\n\nThe condyles of the os occipitis move forwards and backwards in the superior oblique processes of this vertebra; but from the figure of the bones forming these joints, it appears, that very little motion can here be allowed to either side; and there must be still less circular motion.\n\nThe second vertebra colli is called dentata, from the tooth-like process on the upper part of its body.\n\nThe body of this vertebra is somewhat pyramidal, being large, and produced downwards, especially at its fore-side, to enter into a hollow of the vertebra below; while the upper part has a square process with a small point standing out from it. This it is that is imagined to resemble a tooth, and has given name to the vertebra.\u2014The side of this process, on which the hollow of the anterior arch of the first vertebra plays, is convex, smooth, and covered with a cartilage; and it is of the same form behind, for the ligament, which is extended transversely from one rough protuberance of the first vertebra to the other, and is cartilaginous in the middle, to move on it.\n\nThe superior oblique processes of this vertebra dentata are large, circular, very nearly in an horizontal position, and slightly convex, to be adapted to the inferior oblique processes of the first vertebra.\n\nThe transverse processes of the vertebra dentata are short, very little hollowed at their upper part, and not forked at their ends; and the canals through which the cervical arteries pass, are reflected outwards about the middle substance of each process; so that the course of these vessels may be directed towards the transverse processes of the first vertebra.\n\nThe spinal process of this vertebra dentata is thick, strong, and short, to give sufficient origin to the musculi recti majores, and obliqui inferiores, and to prevent the contusion of these and other muscles in pulling the head back.\n\nThe third vertebra of the neck is by some called axis; but this name is applied to it with much less reason than to the second.\u2014This third, and the three below, have nothing particular in their structure; but all their parts come under the general description formerly given, each of them being larger as they descend.\n\nThe seventh vertebra of the neck is near to the form of those of the back, having the upper and lower surfaces of its body less hollow than the others.\u2014The oblique processes are more perpendicular;\u2014neither spinal nor transverse processes are forked.\u2014This seventh and the sixth vertebra of the neck have the hole in each of their transverse processes, more frequently divided by a small cross bridge, that goes between the cervical vein and artery, than any of the other vertebrae.\n\nThe twelve dorsal may be distinguished from the other vertebrae of the spine by the following marks.\n\nTheir bodies are of a middle size, betwixt those of the neck and loins;\u2014they are more convex before than either of the other two sorts; and are flattened laterally by the pressure of the ribs, which are inserted into small cavities formed in their sides. This flattening on their sides, which makes the figure of these vertebrae almost an half oval, is of good use; as it affords a firm articulation to the ribs, allows the trachea arteria to divide at a small angle, and the other large vessels to run secure from the action of the vital organs.\u2014These bodies are more concave behind than any of the other two classes.\u2014Their upper and lower surfaces are horizontal.\n\nThe cartilages interposed between the bodies of these vertebrae are thinner than in any other of the true vertebrae; and contribute to the concavity of the spine in the thorax, by being thinnest at their fore-part.\n\nThe oblique processes are placed almost perpendicular; the upper ones slanting but a little forwards, and the lower ones slanting as much backwards.\u2014They have not as much convexity or concavity as is worth remarking.\u2014Between the oblique processes of opposite sides, several sharp processes stand out from the upper and lower parts of the plates which join to form the spinal process; into these sharp processes strong ligaments are fixed, for connecting the vertebrae.\nThe transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae are long, thicker at their ends than in the middle, and turned obliquely backwards.\n\nThe spinal processes are long, small pointed, and sloping downwards and backwards; from their upper and back-part a ridge rises, which is received by a small channel in the fore-part of the spinal process immediately above, which is here connected to it by a ligament.\n\nThe conduit of the spinal marrow is here more circular, but, corresponding to the size of that cord, is smaller than in any of the other vertebrae, and a larger share of the holes in the bony bridges, for the transmission of the nerves, is formed in the vertebra above, than in the one below.\n\nThe connection of the dorsal vertebrae to the ribs, the thinness of their cartilages, the erect situation of the oblique processes, the length, sloping, and connection of the spinal processes, all contribute to restrain these vertebrae from much motion, which might disturb the actions of the heart and lungs; and, in consequence of the little motion allowed here, the intervertebral cartilages sooner shrivel, by becoming more solid: And therefore, the first remarkable curvature of the spine observed, as people advance to old age, is in the least stretched vertebrae of the back; or old people first become round-shouldered.\n\nThe bodies of the four uppermost dorsal vertebrae deviate from the rule of the vertebrae, becoming larger as they descend; for the first of the four is the largest, and the other three below gradually become smaller, to allow the trachea and large vessels to divide at smaller angles.\n\nThe two uppermost vertebrae of the back, instead of being very prominent forwards, are flattened by the action of the musculi longi colli and recti majores.\n\nThe proportional size of the two little depressions in the body of each vertebra, for receiving the heads of the ribs, seems to vary in the following manner; the depression on the upper edge of each vertebra decreases as far down as the fourth, and after that increases.\n\nThe transverse processes are longer in each lower vertebra to the seventh or eighth, with their smooth surfaces, for the tubercles of the ribs, facing gradually more downwards; but afterwards, as they descend, they become shorter, and the smooth surfaces are directed more upwards.\n\nThe spinous processes of the vertebrae of the back become gradually longer and more slanting from the first, as far down as the eighth or ninth vertebra; from which they manifestly turn shorter and more erect.\n\nThe first vertebra, besides an oblong hollow in its lower edge, that assists in forming the cavity wherein the second rib is received, has the whole cavity for the head of the first rib formed in it.\n\nThe second has the name of axillary, without anything particular in its structure.\n\nThe eleventh often has the whole cavity for the eleventh rib in its body, and wants the smooth surface on each transverse process.\n\nThe twelfth always receives the whole head of the last rib, and has no smooth surface on its transverse processes, which are very short.\u2014The smooth surfaces of its inferior oblique processes face outwards as the lumbar do.\n\nAnd we may say in general, that the upper vertebrae of the back lose gradually their resemblance to those of the neck, and the lower ones come nearer to the figure of the lumbar.\n\nThe lowest order of the true vertebrae is the lumbar, which are five bones, that may be distinguished from any others by these marks: 1. Their bodies, though of a circular form at their fore-part, are somewhat oblong from one side to the other; which may be occasioned by the pressure of the large vessels, the aorta and cava, and of the viscera. The epiphyses on their edges are larger, and therefore the upper and lower surfaces of their bodies are more concave than in the vertebrae of the back.\n\n2. The cartilages between these vertebrae are much the thickest of any, and render the spine convex within the abdomen, by their greatest thickness being at their fore-part.\n\n3. The oblique processes are strong and deep; those in opposite sides being almost placed in parallel planes; the superior, which are concave, facing inwards, and the convex inferior ones facing outwards; and therefore each of these vertebrae receives the one above it, and is received by the one below; which is not so evident in the other two classes already described.\n\n4. Their transverse processes are small, long, and almost erect, for allowing large motion to each bone, and sufficient insertion to muscles, and for supporting and defending the internal parts.\n\n5. Betwixt the roots of the superior oblique and transverse processes, a small protuberance may be observed, where some of the muscles that raise the trunk of the body are inserted.\n\n6. Their spinal processes are strong, straight, and horizontal, with broad flat sides, and a narrow edge above and below; this last being depressed on each side by muscles. And at the root of these edges, we see rough surfaces for fixing the ligaments.\n\n7. The canal for the numerous cords, called cauda equina, into which the spinal marrow divides, is rather larger in these bones than what contains that marrow in the vertebrae of the back.\n\n8. The holes for the passage of the nerves are more equally formed out of both the contiguous vertebrae than in the other classes; the upper one furnishes however the larger share of each hole.\n\nThe thick cartilages between these lumbar vertebrae, their deep oblique processes, and their erect spinal processes, are all fit for allowing large motion; though it is not so great as what is performed in the neck; which appears from comparing the arches which the head describes when moving on the neck, or the loins only.\n\nThe lumbar vertebrae, as they descend, have their oblique processes at a greater distance from each other, and facing more backwards and forwards.\n\nBoth transverse and spinal processes of the middlemost vertebrae of the loins are longest and thickest; in the vertebra above and below they are less; so that these processes of the first and fifth are the least, to prevent their striking on the ribs or os ilium, or their bruising the muscles in the motions of the spine.\n\nThe epiphyses round the edges of the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae are most raised in the two lowest, which consequently make them appear hollower in the middle than the others are.\nThe body of the fifth vertebra is rather thinner than that of the fourth.\u2014The spinal processes of this fifth is smaller, and the oblique processes face more backwards and forwards than in any other lumbar vertebra.\n\nThe False Vertebrae compose the under pyramid of the spine. They are distinguished from the bones already described justly enough by this epithet of false; because, though each bone into which they can be divided in young people, resembles the true vertebrae in figure, yet none of them contribute to the motion of the trunk of the body; they being intimately united to each other in adults, except at their lower part, where they are moveable; whence they are commonly divided into two bones, os sacrum and coccygis.\n\nOs Sacrum, is so called from being offered in sacrifice by the ancients, is of an irregular triangular shape, broad above, narrow below, convex behind, for the advantageous origin of the muscles that move the spine and thigh backwards; and concave behind, for enlarging the cavity of the pelvis.\u2014Four transverse lines of a colour different from the rest of the bone, which are seen on its fore-part, are the marks of division of the five different bones of which it consists in young persons.\n\nThe fore-part of the os sacrum is smooth and flat, to allow a large space for the contained bowels, without any danger of hurting them.\u2014The back-part of it is almost straight, without to large a cavity as the vertebrae have.\u2014The bridges between the bodies and processes of this bone, are much thicker, and in proportion shorter, than in the former clasps of bones.\u2014The strength of these crofs-bridges is very remarkable in the three upper bones, and is well-proportioned to the incumbent weight of the trunk of the body, which these bridges sustain in a transverse, consequently an unfavourable, situation, when the body is erect.\n\nThere are only two oblique processes of the os sacrum; one standing out on each side from the upper part of the first bone.\u2014Their plain erect surfaces face backwards, and are articulated with the inferior oblique processes of the last vertebra of the loins, to which each of these processes is connected by a strong ligament, which rises from a scabrous cavity round their roots, where mucilaginous glands are also lodged.\u2014Instead of the other oblique processes of this bone, four rough tubercles are to be seen on each side of its surface behind, from which the musculus sacri has its origin.\n\nThe transverse processes here are all grown together into one large strong oblong process on each side; which, so far as it answers to the first three bones, is very thick, and divided into two irregular cavities, by a long perpendicular ridge.\u2014The foremost of the two cavities has commonly a thin cartilaginous skin covering it in the recent subject, and is adapted to the unequal protuberance of the os ilium, and a strong ligament connects the circumference of these surfaces of the two bones.\u2014The cavity behind is divided by a transverse ridge into two, where strong ligamentous strings that go from this bone to the os ilium, with a cellular substance containing mucus, are lodged.\n\nThe transverse processes of the two last bones of the os sacrum are much smaller than the former.\u2014At their back-part, near their edge, a knob and oblong flat surface give rise to two strong ligaments which are extended to the os ilium; and are therefore called sacrosciatic.\n\nThe spinal processes of the three uppermost bones of the os sacrum appear short, sharp, and almost erect, while the two lower ones are open behind; and sometimes a little knob is to be seen on the fourth, though generally it is bifurcated, without the two legs meeting into a spine; in which condition also the first is often to be seen. The musculus latissimus dorsi; sacrolumbalis, and gluteus maximus, have part of their origins from these spinal processes.\n\nThe canal between the bodies and processes of this bone, for the cauda equina, is triangular; and becomes smaller as it descends, as the cauda also does.\u2014Below the third bone, this passage is no more a complete bony canal, but is open behind; and is only there defended by a strong ligamentous membrane stretched over it, which, with the muscles that cover it, and are very prominent on each side, is a sufficient defence for the bundle of nerves within.\n\nAt the root of each oblique process of this bone, the notch is conspicuous, by which, and such another in the last vertebra of the loins, a passage is left for the twenty-fourth spinal nerve; and, in viewing the os sacrum, either before or behind, four large holes appear in each side, in much the same height, as where the marks of the union of its several bones remain. Some of the largest nerves of the body pass through the anterior holes; and superficial grooves running outwards from them in different directions, show the course of these nerves.\u2014From the intervals of these grooves, the pyriformis muscle chiefly rises.\u2014The holes in the back-part of the bone are covered by membranes which allow small nerves to pass through them.\u2014The two uppermost of these holes, especially on the fore-side, are the largest; and as the bone descends, the holes turn smaller. Sometimes a notch is only formed at the lower part in each side of this bone; and in other subjects there is a hole common to it and the os coccygis, through which the twenty-ninth pair of spinal nerves passes; and frequently a bony bridge is formed on the back-part of each side by a process sent up from the back-part of the os coccygis, and joined to the little knobs which the last bone of the os sacrum has instead of a spinal process. Under this bridge or jugum, the twenty-ninth pair of spinal nerves runs in its course to the common holes just now described.\n\nThe substance of the os sacrum is very spongy, without any considerable solid external plates, and is lighter proportionally to its bulk than any other bone in the body; but is secured from injuries by the thick muscles that cover it behind, and by the strong ligamentous membranes that closely adhere to it.\n\nThis bone is articulated above to the last vertebra of the loins, in the manner that the lumbar vertebrae are joined; and therefore the same motions may be performed here.\u2014The articulation of the lower part of the os sacrum to the os coccygis seems well enough adapted for allowing\nallowing considerable motion to this last bone, was it not much confined by ligaments. Laterally, the os sacrum is joined to the os ilium by an immovable synchondrosis.\n\nThe uses of the os sacrum are, to serve as the common base and support of the trunk of the body, to guard the nerves proceeding from the end of the spinal marrow, to defend the back-part of the pelvis, and to afford sufficient origin to the muscles which move the trunk and thigh.\n\nOs Coccygis, or rump-bone, is that triangular chain of bones depending from the os sacrum; each bone becoming smaller as they descend, till the last ends almost in a point. The os coccygis is convex behind, and concave before; from which crooked pyramidal figure, which was thought to resemble a cuckow's beak, it has got its name.\n\nThis bone consists of four pieces in people of middle age:\u2014In children, very near the whole of it is cartilage: In old subjects, all the bones are united, and become frequently one continued bone with the os sacrum.\n\nThe highest of the four bones is the largest, with shoulders extended farther to each side than the end of the os sacrum;\u2014the upper surface of this bone is a little hollow.\u2014From the back of that bulbous part called its shoulders, a process often rises up on each side, to join with the bifurcated spine of the fourth and fifth bones of the os sacrum, to form the bony bridge mentioned in the description of the os sacrum.\u2014Immediately below the shoulders of the os coccygis, a notch may be remarked in each side, where the thirtieth pair of the spinal nerves passes.\u2014The lower end of this bone is formed into a small head, which very often is hollow in the middle.\n\nThe three lower bones gradually become smaller, and are spongy; but are strengthened by a strong ligament which covers and connects them.\u2014Their ends, by which they are articulated, are formed in the same manner as those of the first bone are.\n\nThe lower end of the fourth bone terminates in a rough point, to which a cartilage is appended.\n\nTo the sides of these cones of the os coccygis, the coccygei muscles, and part of the levatores ani, and of the glutei maximi, are fixed.\n\nThe os coccygis serves to sustain the intestinum rectum; and, in order to perform this office more effectually, it is made to turn with a curve forwards; by which also the bone itself, as well as the muscles and teguments, is prevented from any injury, when we sit with our body reclined back.\n\nThe second part of the trunk of the skeleton, the Pelvis, is the cylindrical cavity at the lower part of the abdomen, formed by the os sacrum, os coccygis, and os innominata; which last therefore fall now in course to be examined.\n\nThe Ossa Innominata are two large broad bones, which form the fore-part and sides of the pelvic, and the lower part of the sides of the abdomen.\u2014In children each of these bones is evidently divided into three; which are afterwards so intimately united, that scarce the least mark of their former separation remains: notwithstanding, they are described as consisting each of three bones, to wit, the os ilium, os ilium, and pubis.\n\nOs Ilium, or haunch-bone, is situated highest of the three, and reaches as far down as one third of the great cavity into which the head of the thigh-bone is received.\n\nThe external side of this bone is unequally convex, and is called its dorsum;\u2014the internal concave surface is by some (but improperly) named coxa.\u2014The semicircular edge at the highest part of this bone, which is tipped with a cartilage in the recent subject, is named the spine, into which the external or descending oblique muscle of the abdomen is inserted; and from it the internal ascending oblique and the transverse muscles of the belly, with the gluteus maximus, quadratus lumborum, and latissimus dorsi, have their origin.\u2014The ends of the spine are more prominent than the surface of the bone below them; therefore are reckoned processes.\u2014From the anterior spinal process, the sartorius and fascialis muscles have their rise, and the outer end of the doubled tendon of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen, commonly called Fallopian's or Psoas' ligament, is fixed to it.\u2014The inside of the posterior spinal process, and of part of the spine forward from that, is made flat and rough where the sacro-lumbalis and longissimus dorsi rise; and to its outside ligaments, extended to the os sacrum and transverse processes of the fifth and fourth vertebrae of the loins, are fixed.\u2014Below the anterior spinal process another protuberance stands out, which, by its situation, may be distinguished from the former, by adding the epithet of inferior, where the musculus rectus tibiae has its origin.\u2014Betwixt these two anterior processes the bone is hollowed where the beginning of the sartorius muscle is lodged.\u2014Below the posterior spinal processes, a second protuberance of the edge of this bone is in like manner observable, which is closely applied to the os sacrum.\u2014Under this last process a considerable large niche is observable in the os ilium; between the sides of which and the strong ligament that is stretched over from the os sacrum to the sharp-pointed process of the os ilium of the recent subject, a large hole is formed, through which the musculus pyriformis, the great sciatic nerve, and the posterior crural vessels, pass, and are protected from compression.\n\nThe external broad side, or dorsum of the os ilium, is a little hollow towards the fore part; farther back it is as much raised; then is considerably concave; and, lastly, it is convex. These inequalities are occasioned by the actions of the muscles that are situated on this surface.\u2014From behind the uppermost of the two anterior spinal processes, in such places as are strongly marked by the muscles, a semicircular ridge is extended to the hollow passage of the sciatic nerve. Between the spine and this ridge, the gluteus medius takes its rise. Immediately from above the lowest of the anterior spinal processes, a second ridge is stretched to the niche. Between this and the former ridge, the gluteus minimus has its origin.\u2014On the outside of the posterior spinal processes, the dorsum of the os ilium is flat and rough, where part of the musculus gluteus maximus and pyriformis rises.\u2014The lowest part of this bone is the thickest, and is formed into a large\nlarge cavity with high brims, to assist in composing the great acetabulum.\n\nThe internal surface of the os ilium is concave in its broadest fore part, where the internal iliac muscle has its origin, and some share of the intestinum ilium and colon is lodged.\u2014From this large hollow, a small sinuosity is continued obliquely forwards, at the inside of the anterior inferior spinal process, where part of the psoas and iliacus muscles, with the crural vessels and nerves, pass.\u2014The large concavity is bounded below by a sharp ridge, which runs from behind forwards, and being continued with such another ridge of the os pubis, forms a line of partition between the abdomen and pelvis.\u2014Into this ridge the broad tendon of the psoas parvus is inserted.\n\nAll the internal surface of the os ilium, behind this ridge, is very unequal: For the upper part is flat, but spongy, where the sacro-lumbalis and longissimus dorsi rise.\u2014Lower down, there is a transverse ridge from which ligaments go out to the os sacrum.\u2014Immediately below this ridge, the rough unequal cavities and prominences are placed, which are exactly adapted to those described on the side of the os sacrum.\u2014In the same manner, the upper part of this rough surface is porous, for the firmer adhesion of the ligamentous cellular substance; while the lower part is more solid, and covered with a thin cartilaginous skin, for its immoveable articulation with the os sacrum.\n\nOs Ischium, or hip-bone, is of a middle bulk between the two other parts of the os innominatum, is situated lowest of the three, and is of a very irregular figure.\u2014Its extent might be marked by an horizontal line drawn near through the middle of the acetabulum; for the upper bulbous part of this bone forms some less than the lower half of that great cavity, and the small leg of it rises to much the same height on the other side of the great hole common to this bone and the os pubis.\n\nFrom the upper thick part of the os ischium, a sharp process, called by some spinous, stands out backwards, from which chiefly the musculus coccygeus and superior gemellus, and part of the levator ani, rise; and the anterior or internal sacrofascial ligament is fixed to it.\u2014Immediately below this process, a sinuosity is formed for the tendon of the musculus obturator internus.\u2014In a recent subject, this part of the bone, which serves as a pulley on which the obturator muscle plays, is covered with a ligamentous cartilage, that, by two or three small ridges, points out the intertices of the fibres in the tendon of this muscle.\u2014The outer surface of the bone at the root of this spinous process is made hollow by the pyriformis, or iliacus externus muscle.\n\nBelow the sinuosity for the obturator muscle, is the great knob or tuberosity, covered with cartilage or tendon.\u2014The upper part of the tuberosity gives rise to the inferior gemellus muscle.\u2014To a ridge at the inside of this, the external or posterior sacrofascial ligament is so fixed, that between it, the internal ligament, and the sinuosity of the os ischium, a passage is left for the internal obturator muscle.\u2014The upper thick smooth part of the tuber, called by some its dorsum, has two oblique impressions on it. The inner one gives origin to the long head of the biceps flexor tibiae and semimembranosus muscles, and the femoromembranosus rises from the exterior one, which reaches higher and nearer the acetabulum than the other.\u2014The lower, thinner, more scabrous part of the knob which bends forwards, is also marked with two flat surfaces, whereof the internal is what we lean upon in sitting, and the external gives rise to the largest head of the triceps adductor femoris.\u2014Between the external margin of the tuberosity, and the great hole of the os innominatum, there is frequently an obtuse ridge extended down from the acetabulum, which gives origin to the quadratus femoris.\u2014As the tuber advances forwards, it becomes smaller, and is rough, for the origin of the musculus transversalis and erector penis.\u2014The small leg of it, which mounts upwards to join the os pubis, is rough and prominent at its edge, where the two lower heads of the triceps or quadriceps adductor femoris take their rise.\n\nThe upper and back part of the os ischium is broad and thick; but its lower and fore-part is narrower and thinner.\n\nThe os ilium and pubis of the same side are the only bones which are contiguous to the os ischium.\n\nThe Os Pubis, or share-bone, is the least of the three parts of the os innominatum, and is placed at the upper fore-part of it.\u2014The thick largest part of this bone is employed in forming the acetabulum; from which, becoming much smaller, it is stretched inwards to its fellow of the other side, where again it grows larger, and sends a small branch downwards to join the end of the small leg of the os ischium.\u2014The upper fore-part of each os pubis is tuberous and rough, where the musculus rectus and pyramidalis are inserted.\u2014From this a ridge is extended along the upper edge of the bone, in a continued line with such another of the os ilium, which divides the abdomen and pelvis. The ligament of Fallopia is fixed to the internal end of this ridge, and the smooth hollow below it is made by the psoas and iliacus internus muscles passing with the anterior crural vessels and nerves behind the ligament.\u2014Some way below the former ridge, another is extended from the tuberous part of the os pubis downwards, and onwards towards the acetabulum; between these two ridges the bone is hollow and smooth, for lodging the head of the pectineus muscle.\u2014Immediately below, where the lower ridge is to take the turn downwards, a winding notch is made, which is comprehended in the great foramen of a skeleton, but is formed into a hole by a subhended ligament in the recent subject, for the passage of the posterior crural nerve, an artery, and a vein.\u2014The internal end of the os pubis is rough and unequal, for the firmer adhesion of the thick ligamentous cartilage that connects it to its fellow of the other side:\u2014The process which goes down from that to the os ischium is broad and rough before, where the gracilis and upper heads of the triceps, or rather quadriceps adductor femoris, have their origin.\n\nBetwixt the os ischium and pubis a very large irregular hole is left, which, from its resemblance to a door or shield, has been called thyroides. This hole is all, except the notch for the posterior crural nerve, filled up, in a recent subject, with a strong ligamentous membrane,\nthat adheres very firmly to its circumference. From this membrane chiefly the two obturator muscles, external and internal, take their rise.\u2014The great design of this hole, besides rendering the bone lighter, is to allow a strong enough origin to the obturator muscles, and sufficient space for lodging their bellies, that there may be no danger of disturbing the functions of the contained viscera of the pelvis by the actions of the internal, nor of the external being bruised by the thigh-bone, especially by its lesser trochanter, in the motions of the thigh inwards.\u2014The bowels sometimes make their way through the notch for the vessels, at the upper part of this thyroid hole, which causes a hernia in this place.\n\nIn the external surface of the os innominatum, near the outside of the great hole, a large deep cavity is formed by all the three bones conjunctly: For the os pubis constitutes about one fifth; the os ilium makes something less than two fifths, and the os ischium as much more than two fifths. The brims of this cavity are very high, and are still much more enlarged by the ligamentous cartilage, with which they are tipped in a recent subject. From this form of the cavity it has been called acetabulum; and, for a distinguishing character, the name of the bone that contributes the largest share of it is added; therefore acetabulum ossis ischii is the name this cavity commonly bears.\u2014Round the base of the supercilia the bone is rough and unequal, where the capsular ligament of the articulation is fixed.\u2014The brims at the upper and back-part of the acetabulum are much larger and higher than any where else; which is very necessary to prevent the head of the femur from slipping out of its cavity at this place, where the whole weight of the body bears upon it, and consequently would otherwise be constantly in danger of thrusting it out.\u2014As these brims are extended downwards and forwards, they become less; and at their internal lower part a breach is made in them; from the one side of which to the other, a ligament is placed in the recent subject; under which a large hole is left, which contains a fatty cellular substance and vessels.\u2014Besides this difference in the height of the brims, the acetabulum is otherwise unequal: For the lower internal part of it is depressed below the cartilaginous surface of the upper-part, and is not covered with cartilage; into the upper-part of this particular depression, where it is deepest and of a femoral form, the ligament of the thigh-bone, commonly called the round one, is inserted; while in its more superficial lower part the large mucilaginous gland of this joint is lodged. The largest share of this separate depression is formed in the os ischium.\n\nThe os innominata are joined at their back-part to each side of the os sacrum by a sort of future, with a very thin intervening cartilage, which serves as so much glue to cement these bones together; and strong ligaments go from the circumference of this unequal surface to connect them more firmly. The osa innominata are connected together at their fore-part by the ligamentous cartilage interposed between the two osa pubis.\u2014These bones can therefore have no motion in a natural state, except what is common to the trunk of the body, or to the os sacrum.\n\nEach os innominatum affords a socket (the acetabulum) for the thigh-bones to move in, and the trunk of the body rolls here so much on the heads of the thighs-bones, as to allow the most conspicuous motions of the trunk, which are commonly thought to be performed by the bones of the spine.\n\nThe pelvis then has a large open above where it is continued with the abdomen, is strongly fenced by bones on the sides, back, and fore-part, and appears with a wide opening below, in the skeleton; but, in the recent subject, a considerable part of the opening is filled by the fasciocutaneous ligaments, pyriform, internal obturator, levatores ani, gemini, and coccygei muscles, which support and protect the contained parts better than bones could have done; so that space is only left at the lowest part of it, for the large excretories, the vesica urinaria, intestinum rectum, and in females, the uterus, to discharge themselves.\n\nThe Thorax, or chest, reaches from below the neck to the belly; and, by means of the bones that guard it, is formed into a large cavity: The figure of which is somewhat conoidal.\n\nThe bones which form the thorax are the twelve dorsal vertebrae behind, the ribs on the sides, and the sternum before.\n\nThe vertebrae have already been described as part of the spine.\n\nThe Ribs, or costae, (as if they were custodes, or guards, to those principal organs of the animal machine, the heart and lungs,) are the long crooked bones placed at the side of the chest, in an oblique direction downwards in respect of the back-bone.\u2014Their number is generally twelve on each side; though frequently eleven or thirteen have been found.\n\nThe ribs are all concave internally; where they are also made smooth by the action of the contained parts, which, on this account, are in no danger of being hurt by them; and they are convex externally, that they might resist that part of the pressure of the atmosphere, which is not balanced by the air within the lungs, during inspiration.\u2014The ends of the ribs next the vertebrae are rounder than they are after these bones have advanced forwards, when they become flatter and broader, and have an upper and lower edge, each of which is made rough by the action of the intercostal muscles, inserted into them.\u2014The upper edge of the ribs is more obtuse and rounder than the lower, which is depressed on its internal side by a long fossa, for lodging the intercostal vessels and nerves; on each side of which there is a ridge, to which the intercostal muscles are fixed. The fossa is not observable however at either end of the ribs: for, at the posterior or root, the vessels have not yet reached the ribs; and, at the fore-end, they are split away into branches, to serve the parts between the ribs.\n\nAt the posterior end of each rib, a little head is formed, which is divided by a middle ridge into two plain or hollow surfaces; the lowest of which is the broadest and deepest in most of them. The two plains are joined to the bodies of two different vertebrae, and the ridge forces itself into the intervening cartilage.\nA little way from this head, we find, on the external surface, a small cavity, where mucilaginous glands are lodged; and round the head, the bone appears spongy, where the capsular ligament of the articulation is fixed.\n\nImmediately beyond this a flatted tubercle rises, with a small cavity at, and roughness about its root, for the articulation of the rib with the transverse process of the lowest of the two vertebrae, with the bodies of which the head of the rib is joined. Advancing further on this external surface, we observe in most of the ribs another smaller tubercle, into which ligaments which connect the ribs to each other, and to the transverse processes of the vertebrae, and portions of the longissimus dorsi, are inserted. Beyond this the ribs are made flat by the sacro-lumbalis muscle, which is inserted into the part of this flat surface farthest from the spine, where each rib makes a considerable curve, called by some its angle. Then the rib begins to turn broad, and continues so to its anterior end, which is hollow and spongy, for the reception of, and firm coalition with the cartilage that runs thence to be inserted into the sternum, or to be joined with some other cartilage.\n\nTo the fore-end of each rib a long broad and strong cartilage is fixed, and reaches thence to the sternum, or is joined to the cartilage of the next rib. This course, however, is not in a straight line with the rib; for generally the cartilages make a considerable curve, the concave part of which is upwards; therefore, at their insertion into the sternum, they make an obtuse angle above, and an acute one below. These cartilages, as all others, are firmer and harder internally, than they are on their external surface.\n\nThe ribs then are articulated at each end, of which the one behind is doubly joined to the vertebra; for the head is received into the cavities of two bodies of the vertebrae, and the larger tubercle is received into the depression in the transverse process of the lower vertebra.\n\nHitherto we have laid down the general structure and connection of the ribs, and shall next mark their differences.\n\nIn viewing the ribs from above downwards, their figure is still straighter; the uppermost being the most crooked of any. Their obliquity, in respect of the spine, increases as they descend; so that though their distances from each other is very little different at their back-part, yet at their fore-ends the distances between the lower ones must increase.\n\nThe length of the ribs increases from the first and uppermost rib, as far down as the seventh; and from that to the twelfth, as gradually diminishes. The superior of the two plain, or rather hollow surfaces, by which the ribs are articulated to the bodies of the vertebrae, gradually increases from the first to the fourth rib, and is diminished after that in each lower rib. The distance of their angles from the heads always increases as they descend to the ninth, because of the greater breadth of the sacro-lumbalis muscle.\n\nThe ribs are commonly divided into true and false.\n\nThe true costae are the seven upper ones of each side, whose cartilages are all gradually longer as the ribs descend, and are joined to the breast-bone; so that being pressed constantly between two bones, they are flatted at both ends, and are thicker, harder, and more liable to ossify, than the other cartilages that are not subject to so much pressure. These ribs include the heart and lungs; and therefore are the proper or true custodes of life.\n\nThe five inferior ribs of each side are the false or bastard, whose cartilages do not reach to the sternum; and therefore, wanting the resistance at their fore-part, they are there pointed; and, on this account, having less pressure, their substance is softer. The cartilages of these false ribs are shorter as the ribs descend.\n\nTo all these five ribs the circular edge of the diaphragm is connected; and its fibres, instead of being stretched immediately transversely, and so running perpendicular to the ribs, are pressed so as to be often, especially in expiration, parallel to the plane in which the ribs lie.\n\nThe first rib of each side is so situated, that the flat sides are above and below, while one edge is placed inwards, and the other outwards, or nearly so; therefore sufficient space is left above it for the subclavian vessels and muscle; and the broad concave surface is opposed to the lungs. But then, in consequence of this situation, the channel for the intercostal vessels is not to be found, and the edges are differently formed from all the other, except the second; the lower one being rounded, and the other sharp. The head of this rib is not divided into two plain surfaces by a middle ridge, because it is only articulated with the first vertebra of the thorax. Its cartilage is ossified in adults, and is united to the sternum at right angles. Frequently this first rib has a ridge rising near the middle of its posterior edge, where one of the heads of the scalenus muscle rises. Further forward it is flatted, or sometimes depressed by the clavicle.\n\nThe fifth, sixth, and seventh, or rather the sixth, seventh, eighth, and sometimes the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth ribs, have their cartilages at least contiguous; and frequently they are joined to each other by crofs cartilages; and most commonly the cartilages of the eighth, ninth, tenth, are connected to the former, and to each other, by firm ligaments.\n\nThe eleventh, and sometimes the tenth rib, has no tubercle for its articulation with the transverse process of the vertebra, to which it is only loosely fixed by ligaments. The fossa in its lower edge is not so deep as in the upper ribs, because the vessels run more towards the interface between the ribs. Its fore-end is smaller than its body, and its short small cartilage is but loosely connected to the cartilage of the rib above.\n\nThe twelfth rib is the shortest and straightest. Its head is only articulated with the last vertebra of the thorax; therefore is not divided into two surfaces. This rib is not joined to the transverse process of the vertebra, and therefore has no tubercle, being often pulled necessarily inwards by the diaphragm, which an articulation with the transverse process would not have allowed. The fossa is not found at its under edge, because the vessels run below it. The fore-part of this rib is smaller than its middle, and has only a very small-pointed cartilage fixed to it. To its whole internal side the diaphragm is connected.\nThe Sternum, or breast-bone, is the broad flat bone or pile of bones, at the fore-part of the thorax.\u2014In adults of a middle age, it is composed of three bones, which easily separate after the cartilages connecting them are destroyed. Frequently the two lower bones are found intimately united; and very often in old people, the sternum is a continued bony substance from one end to the other; though we still observe two, sometimes three, transverse lines on its surface; which are marks of the former divisions.\n\nWhen we consider the sternum as one bone, we find it broadest and thickest above, and becoming smaller as it descends. The internal surface of this bone is somewhat hollowed for enlarging the thorax; but the convexity on the external surface is not so conspicuous, because the sides are pressed outwards by the true ribs; the round heads of whose cartilages are received into seven smooth pits, formed in each side of the sternum, and are kept firm there by strong ligaments, which, on the external surface, have a particular radiated texture.\u2014The pits at the upper part of the sternum are at the greatest distance from one another, and, as they descend, are nearer; so that the two lowest are contiguous.\n\nThe first of the three bones that compose the sternum, all agree, is somewhat of the figure of a heart, as it is commonly painted; only it does not terminate in a sharp point.\u2014This is the uppermost thickest part of the sternum.\n\nThe upper middle part of this first bone, where it is thickest, is hollowed, to make place for the trachea arteria; though this cavity is principally formed by the bone being raised on each side of it, partly by the clavicles thrusting it inwards, and partly by the sterno-mastoidei muscles pulling it upwards.\u2014On the outside of each tubercle, there is an oblong cavity, that, in viewing it transversely from before backwards, appears a little convex: Into these glenae the ends of the clavicles are received.\u2014In the side of the under end of this first bone, the half of the pit for the second rib on each side is formed.\u2014The upper part of the surface behind is covered with a strong ligament, which secures the clavicles.\n\nThe second or middle division of this bone, is much longer, narrower, and thinner than the first; but, excepting that it is a little narrower above than below, it is nearly equal all over in its dimensions of breadth or thickness.\u2014In the sides of it are complete pits for the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs, and an half of the pits for the second and seventh.\n\nThe third bone is much less than the other two, and has only one half of the pit for the seventh rib formed in it; wherefore it might be reckoned only an appendix of the sternum.\u2014In young subjects it is always cartilaginous, and is better known by the name of cartilago xiphoides, or ensiformis, than any other; though the ancients often called the whole sternum ensiforme.\u2014This third bone is seldom of the same figure, magnitude, or situation in any two subjects; for sometimes it is a plain triangular bone, with one of the angles below, and perpendicular to the middle of the upper side, by which it is connected to the second bone.\u2014In other people, the point is turned to one side, or obliquely forwards or backwards.\u2014Frequently it is all nearly of an equal breadth, and in several subjects it is bifurcated; whence some writers give it the name of furcella, or furcula inferior; or else it is unossified in the middle.\u2014In the greatest number of adults it is ossified, and tipped with a cartilage; in some, one half of it is cartilaginous; and in others, it is all in a cartilaginous state.\u2014Generally several oblique ligaments, fixed at one end to the cartilages of the ribs, and by the other to the outer surface of the xiphoid-bone, connect it firmly to those cartilages.\n\nThe uses of the sternum are, to afford origin and insertion to several muscles; to sustain the mediastinum, to defend the vital organs, the heart and lungs, at the fore-part; and, lastly, by serving as a moveable fulcrum of the ribs, to assist considerably in respiration.","sp":206,"ep":215},{"h":"OF WINDOWS","t":"The first consideration with regard to windows, is their size, which varies according to the climate, the definition of the building, &c. In Britain, the windows of the smallest private houses are commonly from 3 to 3\u00bd feet broad; and being generally twice their breadth in height, or somewhat more, in the principal apartments, they generally rise to within a foot or two of the ceilings of the rooms, which are frequently no higher than 10 feet, and at most 12 or 13. But, in more considerable houses, the apartments are from 15 to 20 feet high, and sometimes more; and in these the windows are from 4 to 5 and 5\u00bd feet broad, and high in proportion. These dimensions are sufficient for dwelling-houses of any size in this country; when they are larger, they admit too much of the cold air in winter. But churches, and other buildings of that kind, may have larger windows, proportioned to the size of the structures.\n\nThe proportions of the apertures of windows depend upon their situation. Their breadth in all the stories must be the same; but the different heights of the apartments make it necessary to vary the height of the windows likewise. In the principal floor, it may be from 2\u00bd of the breadth to 2\u00be, according as the rooms have more or less elevation. In the ground-story, where the apartments are lower, the apertures of the windows seldom exceed a double square; and, when they are in a rustic basement, they are frequently made much lower. The height of the windows of the second floor may be from 1\u00bd of their breadth to 1\u00be; and Attics and Mezzanines may be either a perfect square, or somewhat lower.\n\nThe windows of the principal floor are generally most enriched. The simplest method of adorning them is, with an architrave surrounding the aperture, and crowned with a frieze and cornice. The windows of the ground-floor are sometimes left entirely plain, without\nany ornament; and at others they are surrounded with rustics, or a regular architrave with a frieze and cornice. Those of the second floor have generally an architrave carried entirely round the aperture; and the same is the method of adorning Attic and Mezzanine windows. But the two last have seldom either frieze or cornice; whereas the second-floor windows are often crowned with both.\n\nThe breasts of all the windows on the same floor should be on the same level, and raised above the floor from two feet nine inches to three feet six inches at the very most. When the walls are thick, the breasts should be reduced under the apertures, for the convenience of looking out. In France, the windows are frequently carried quite down to the floor. When the building is surrounded with gardens, or other beautiful objects, this method renders the rooms exceeding pleasant.\n\nThe interval between the apertures of windows depends in a great measure on their enrichments. The breadth of the aperture is the least distance that can be between them; and twice that breadth should be the largest in dwelling-houses; otherwise the rooms will not be sufficiently lighted. The windows in all the stories of the same aspect must be placed exactly above one another.\n\nPlate XXXII. Fig. 1. Is a design of P. Lefcot, abbot of Clagny, executed in the old Louvre at Paris. The apertures may be a double square, or a trifle more; the architrave from one sixth to one seventh of the breadth of the aperture: The pilaster is equal to that breadth, when the architrave is narrow; or less, by one quarter, or one fifth, when it is broad. The whole entablature should not exceed one quarter of the height of the aperture, nor be much lower. The consoles may be equal in length to half the breadth of the aperture at most, and to one third of it at least.\n\nFig. 2.

I. Of Manures.\n\nEvery substance which promotes the growth of plants is denominated a manure.\n\nAs to the operation of manures, some maintain, that they give to the earth an additional quantity of the vegetable food; others, that they are of no other use than to divide the soil, and therefore that tillage may be substituted in their place. This last opinion was embraced by Mr Tull, and is the fundamental principle in his horse-hoeing husbandry. A minute division of the soil will do a great deal; but the experience of all ages shows that it will do much more by the addition of manure.\n\nIn Scotland, it is the universal practice to dung lands, that are in constant tillage, at least once in five years; and it consists with observation, that the ground is considerably enriched the first year, but that the crops gradually decline till the virtues of the dung are entirely exhausted.\n\nSome manures lose their virtue by being long exposed to the air. If dung be kept after it is sufficiently rotted, the most valuable part of it will evaporate. Others, as lime and marles, are of an opposite nature: the longer they are exposed to the air, their utility to the land is improved. From this circumstance it is probable, that marles and lime attract something from the air which renders them more favourable to vegetation.\n\nThere is a great variety of substances which, when laid upon land, act as manures. But the most usual manures in this country are dung, lime, marles, ashes, foot, sea-weed, shells, &c.\n\nOf Dung.\n\nDung is properly the excrement of animals; but what commonly goes by that name, is a mixture of excrements, putrefied vegetable and animal substances. If dunghills be kept after they are sufficiently rotted, the oily and more volatile parts, which are the best ingredients, fly off. They should likewise be placed in a dry situation, and raised high at the sides, to prevent these parts from being carried off by water; for much water prevents the uniform putrefaction of dunghills of this mixed kind.\n\nTo promote a proper putrefaction, the dung should not be laid in small heaps, but spread thick upon the dunghill; for by this means the fermentation commences sooner, the natural sap is preserved, and the dung is prevented from being burnt, or fire-fanged, as it is termed by farmers. Dung, when burnt in this manner, is dry, white, and useless as a manure. It is agreed, that dunghills ought to be covered, to prevent the exhalation of vegetable food. But the difficulty is, how to execute it. Some propose a thin layer of earth for this purpose; others, that a pit should be dug, built with flags at the side, and covered with a roof. The former would answer very well, were it not for the additions that are constantly making to dunghills; and the latter is so expensive, that few people will choose to make trial of it. When dung comes from the stable or byre, it is mixed with straw; which absorbs the moisture, and prevents it from exhaling till the straw itself putrefies. When in this situation, if it be laid thick upon the top of the dunghill, there being but a small surface exposed to the air, the juices will be tolerably well preserved.\n\nAs dung thus loses its best qualities by being exposed to the sun and weather, it ought to be plowed in as soon as possible, after being laid upon land. If sufficiently putrefied, it should be plowed in with a shallow furrow, as its juices are washed down by the rain: it should likewise be spread very equally; for when large pieces lie scattered up and down, they become a nidus to insects and vermin.\n\nOf Lime.\n\nLime being of an alkaline nature, attracts acids; hence it is supposed to communicate to the soil a power of attracting the vegetable food from the air. Lime is a heavy substance, and penetrates deep into the soil; it sometimes even sinks below the reach of the plow. By fermenting with acids, it breaks down and divides the soil into small particles, and makes it soft, mellow; and evidently in a state of fermentation. It likewise dissolves oils, and all animal and vegetable substances, and converts them into vegetable food. This quality renders it peculiarly useful in destroying root-weeds.\n\nThese being the general properties of lime, it is supposed to have a twofold operation upon land. When a large quantity is used, especially after being long exposed to the air, it promotes vegetation by giving a kind of stimulus to the soil, and making it exert itself. This operation of lime is not merely hypothetical; for experience shows, that land thoroughly limed may be reduced to a poorer condition by cropping, than if it had nor been limed at all. It is even possible to reduce limed land to a caput mortuum; and the more frequently and the better the land is plowed, it is the sooner reduced to this state.\n\nLime also enriches land, by augmenting the vegetable aliment. When intended for this purpose, only a small quantity should be employed; as a small quantity of lime is sufficient to impregnate a large quantity of earth; and\nand to communicate to it as high a degree of an absorbing quality as it is capable of receiving.\n\nThese different operations of lime is confirmed by experience, and agreeable to the practice in those parts of Scotland where lime is most used. When employed for the purpose of improving barren lands, it is laid on in large quantities, to give a stimulus to the soil, and make it exert all its vigour; and when applied to land already improved, it is used in small quantities, and repeated once every third or fourth year, to prevent too great an exertion, and impoverishing the land, by exhausting too much of the vegetable food.\n\nThe lands in Scotland capable of the greatest improvement by lime, are the out-field and muir lands. The out-field land is generally kept three years in tillage, and carries three crops of oats; it is then allowed to rest six years, and after that is brought again into tillage. This method of cultivating out-field land is found, by calculation, to be sufficiently able to bear the expense, and allow a reasonable profit to the farmer, besides the improvement the lands derive from the lime.\n\nIn England, lime is sometimes used as a top-dressing for wheat. The method is this: They sow their wheat without laying on any manure; and in the beginning of February, for every acre of land, they take 20 bushels of unslaked lime, and 4 bushels of sand, or brick-rubbish. Towards the end of the month, the lime is slaked and mixed with the sand: In the last week of the month, this is scattered by way of top-dressing over the green wheat; and as rain generally succeeds, it is soon washed down to the roots of the plant, and gives them a vigour and strength of growth that is astonishing to people who have never seen this method practised. But, if the weather inclines to be dry, the quantity of sand must be doubled, to prevent the plants from being burnt by the corrosive quality of the lime.\n\nOf Marles.\n\nThe general characters by which marle is best distinguished, are these: It attracts and ferments with acids, and does not bake in the fire like potter's earth, which distinguishes it sufficiently from clay; upon being exposed for some time to the air and weather, it dissolves like quick-lime, and falls into a fine powder; when dry, it is friable and unctuous like lead-ore; when wet, it is soft and slippery to the touch; whereas virgin-earth is rough and gritty.\n\nThere are a great variety of marles; but they are generally reduced to three kinds: The clay, the stone, and the shell marle.\n\nThe clay and stone marles are nearly of the same nature; but the shell-marle differs from both.\n\nOf Clay and Stone Marles.\n\nThough plants will not grow in these marles, when pure; yet, when mixed with soil, they become an excellent manure.\n\nStone and clay marles are possessed of much the same qualities with lime, and consequently act nearly in the same manner upon the soil. They communicate to the soil a power of attracting the vegetable food from the air, dissolve the vegetable food, and prepare it for entering the roots of plants. They likewise attract oils so strongly, that they are frequently used for extracting greasy spots out-of-cloth; they are therefore supposed to attract oil from the air and earth, which is the chief ingredient in the nourishment of plants.\n\nBoth the clay and stone marles are long of dissolving. Large pieces of the stone-marle are sometimes found undissolved many years after it has been laid on the land. This renders it necessary to lay on a large quantity of them, lest their effects should not at first appear.\n\nAs marle may be used with safety in greater quantity than lime, it must communicate to the soil a stronger power of attracting the vegetable food, and consequently it ought always to be preferred. Marle is likewise preferable to lime in this respect, that it is longer of dissolving; and therefore the land will continue to carry better crops for several years longer after it has been marled. However, if the soil be soft and spungy, the marle, like lime, will sink below the reach of the plough, and prevent those advantages which might naturally be expected from it.\n\nThough marle is preferable to lime as a manure; yet it must be considered, that their operation upon the earth is the same; consequently, when marled land has been exhausted with crops, it cannot receive much benefit from an immediate application of marle a second time; for the same reason, it can receive as little advantage from lime: Dung therefore, as it contains a great proportion of the vegetable food, which lime and marles diminish, is the most proper manure for marled or limed lands exhausted with crops.\n\nWhat was said with regard to the application of lime, in smaller or larger quantities, to barren lands and lands in good order, may be said with equal propriety with regard to stone and clay marles.\n\nOf Shell-marle.\n\nThis marle is of a different nature from the stone and clay marles. It does not dissolve with water, but absorbs and swells with it like a sponge: It attracts acids more forcibly. But the principal difference between the shell-marle and the other marles consists in this, that the shell-marle contains a great quantity of oil.\n\nThis marle is therefore supposed to promote vegetation, by increasing the food of plants, by communicating to the soil a power of attracting this food from the air, by dividing the soil into small particles, and by preparing the vegetable food for being absorbed by their roots.\n\nAs shell-marle does not exhaust land like lime and the other marles, it may be repeated as often as the husbandman pleases. Its effects are likewise more sudden.\n\nOf Ashes.\n\nThe ashes of vegetables contain a large quantity of alkaline salt: Hence they attract acids more strongly than any other substances.\nThe operation of ashes upon the soil must therefore be of the same nature with that of lime, only it is more violent and sudden, and consequently it is sooner over. This is confirmed by experience. After land has been manured with ashes, the first crop is commonly very luxuriant; but a second crop almost entirely exhausts the land. Hence ashes should be laid on in small quantities, and should not be applied to land exhausted by lime or marl; neither should they be repeated, or followed by these manures.\n\nBurnt turf is generally recommended as a manure. Turfs are chiefly composed of vegetables; their ashes, therefore, must be of the same nature with those of wood or any other vegetable substance. It is found by experience, that the burning of turfs turns out to advantage in proportion to the number of roots they contain; and therefore land, with a tough sward of grass, is most proper to be improved in this manner.\n\nIn burning turf, the heaps must be covered in such a manner as to prevent the flame from breaking out; otherwise the most useful part of the ashes will fly off.\n\nTo prevent burnt land from being exhausted, one or two crops only should be taken, and then the land ought to be laid out in grass. Its fertility will be greatly increased, if a little dung be added after the first crop.\n\nOf Soot.\n\nSoot contains oil, salt, and earth. It promotes vegetation in the same manner as dung or shell-marl. Soot is generally applied in the Spring as a top-dressing to winter corn or grass. The effects of soot used in this way are so sudden, that they evidently appear after the first rain. But its virtues are commonly exhausted by a single crop. However, when the effects of soot are over, the soil is not exhausted, as by ashes or lime; it may therefore be repeated as often as the farmer thinks proper; or it may be followed with advantage by ashes, lime, or marl.\n\nOf Sea-weed.\n\nAll plants that grow upon rocks, within reach of the sea, are good manures. These are frequently loosened and driven ashore by the tide. They are of a soft pulpy nature, and soon putrefy.\n\nSea-weeds promote vegetation in the same manner as dung or soot; but their effects are not so lasting as dung. However, they are preferable to dung in this respect, that they do not produce so many weeds.\n\nThey may be applied to land in any situation, and are peculiarly proper for land that is exhausted by lime or ashes. When their effects cease, the land is not injured, and any kind of manure may be used after them.\n\nThe oftener sea-weeds are applied, the land becomes the richer. This is confirmed by experience. The lands near the shores, where the weeds have been long used as manures, are among the richest in Scotland, and have been kept almost constantly in tillage.\n\nOf Shells.\n\nBeds of shells are to be met with in many places, but particularly near the sea-shore.\n\nThese shells ferment with acids, and, like other animal-substances, contain oil, salt, and earth. Their operation is supposed to be of the same kind with that of shell-marl: But, as they take a long time to dissolve, their effects must be slower and weaker: They ought therefore to be applied in large quantities, otherwise their operation will be hardly perceptible.\n\nShells exhaust the land, but not near so much as lime or ashes; it is therefore improper to use them immediately after these manures.\n\nWhen shells are found below the surface of the ground, as they generally are, they should be exposed to the air for some time before they are ploughed in: This not only assists their fermentation, but promotes their putrefaction.\n\nOf Vegetables in an entire State, or sown for Manure.\n\nIt is a practice in many places, particularly in England, to sow turnip, peas, buck-wheat, &c. and to plough them down for manuring the land.\n\nThis practice is thought by some people to be attended with no advantage; because the plants, when ploughed down, can convey no more food to the soil than they take from it. But it ought to be considered, that some of the plants employed in this manner push their roots below the reach of the plough, and suck up the food to the surface; the seed that is sown likewise contains a great proportion of vegetable food; besides what the plants, when growing, may derive from the air, &c. From these circumstances it may be inferred, that they actually return more nourishment to the soil than they extract from it. The covering of the surface is also an advantage: Every farmer knows, that when the soil has been covered for a considerable time by a strong crop of peas, or any other corn laid down, the soil, though naturally hard and stiff, becomes soft, mellow, and free.\n\nOf Water.\n\nRain-water contains a considerable quantity of vegetable food. When it falls upon land that has a descent, by running off, it must carry along with it some of the finest particles of the soil and the vegetable food contained in them. If this water, then, is let in upon a field, and allowed to settle, the land will receive from it not only the vegetable food contained in the water itself, but likewise what is contained in the particles of earth carried off from the higher grounds.\n\nThis method of manuring can only be used in fields which lie on the sides of rivers, or such as can be easily drained. In practising it, the water must not be allowed to run off violently, otherwise it does more hurt than good. Land in grass is most proper for this kind of manuring.\nmanuring. The firmness of the surface prevents any of the soil from being carried off when the water is draining, and the grass entangles the mud, &c., and hinders them from going along with the water.\n\nThis operation should be performed in the spring. In that season grass-lands suffer least from being overgrown.\n\n**Sect. III. Of Soils with Respect to Manures.**\n\nSoils are very different in their natures, and composed of very different ingredients. Some soils contain more, and others less, of the food necessary for the nourishment of plants. It is necessary to inquire into these differences, in order to discover what manures are most proper for each kind.\n\nThe soils most common in Scotland are the black loamy, the clay, the sandy, and the mossy. Of these there are many varieties, according to the different proportions of that particular kind of earth from which they are denominated. Some soils are even so blended, that it is difficult to determine what kind of earth most prevails in them.\n\n**Of the Black Loamy Soil.**\n\nPure loam seems to be nothing else but the earth of putrefied vegetables, accumulated by the successive decay of natural or artificial crops. In cultivated lands, dung and other manure greatly increase the quantity of the loam.\n\nThe principal qualities of loam are these: When allowed to rest, it acquires a degree of cohesion, but never becomes so hard and tough as clay; when turned up and exposed to the air, it becomes free and open, and easily crumbles down; when dry, it readily admits water, and swells and retains it like shell-marl; however, it only retains a proper quantity, and allows the rest to run off. It also contains oil, ferments with acids, and is of an absorbent nature.\n\nThere is no soil altogether pure; but that soil which has loam in its composition possesses in some degree all the qualities of loam; and these qualities are unquestionably the most proper for nourishing plants.\n\nIts oils and fats afford food to the plants; the absorbent quality of which it is possessed, also attracts vegetable food from the air; its friability, and fermenting with acids, give an easy passage to the roots to acquire this food.\n\nExperience, the only sure guide in subjects of this kind, shows that a loamy soil is most fruitful. Some soils, when well limed or dugged, may bear as great crops as the loamy soil; but then they require a supply much sooner. The loamy soil has likewise another advantage over every other: It does not suffer so much from drought or rain, as clay and sandy soils.\n\nAll land called in-field land has a certain quantity of loam in its composition, probably owing to the dung which is laid from time to time upon it. This is the only distinction betwixt out-field and in-field land.\n\nThe soil which contains a great proportion of loam, requires very little manure. It may be kept constantly in good heart by proper tillage and good management.\n\nThe common loamy soil requires manure, and no kind of manure is improper for it; dung, however, is unquestionably the best. Lime, unless managed with care, is in danger of hurting a loamy soil by exhausting it.\n\n**Of the Clay-Soil.**\n\nThe richest kind of clay-soil is that which consists of clay and loam. To discover the nature of this soil, it is necessary to know the qualities of clay.\n\nClay is a very solid body, and its parts adhere firmly together: It does not easily admit water, but is capable of containing a great quantity, swells but little, and does not easily part with it. When dry, clay is very hard, and becomes the harder the more suddenly it is dried. In the process of drying, it contracts unequally, and breaks out into rents or fissures where the cohesion is weakest. It ferments with acids, but has no oil in its composition.\n\nFrom a slight view of these qualities it appears, that a clay-soil is not so well adapted for the nourishment of plants as the loamy: it is more subject to receive injuries from drought or rain. In a rainy season, as it is adverse to part with the water after it once admits it, the roots of plants will be much weakened or destroyed by being long soaked in the water. On the other hand, in a very dry season, it becomes so hard, that the roots cannot penetrate deep enough to search for food.\n\nThese observations are fully confirmed by experience. For it is well known to the husbandman, that the produce of clay-soils are extremely uncertain, as they are liable to be destroyed by dry or wet seasons. These soils labour under another disadvantage; as they repel water, especially when it falls in small quantities, they reap no benefit from dews or slight showers.\n\nThe clay-soil is said to contain vegetable food, but does not allow it to be easily dissolved; and hence lime, marl, or ashes, are the most proper manures for it, as they divide it into small particles. These manures likewise communicate to it a greater power of absorption; and therefore they will enable it both to receive and transmit water more readily, and of course make it less subject to be injured by the weather. Clay-soils, when mixed with sand or till, they are very rich; but, when mixed with sand or till, they are very poor. Poor clay-soils require such manures as contain the greatest quantity of vegetable food; therefore dung, shell-marl, sea-weed, &c., are the best manures for them.\n\n**Of the Sandy Soil.**\n\nThere are two kinds of sand that enter into the composition of soils; the one consists of small particles of flint, the other of broken shells.\nThe sandy-soil which is composed of flinty particles, easily receives and transmits water; and consequently is not capable of containing a sufficient quantity for promoting the growth of plants: Its particles do not adhere, and is therefore unable to support plants that have few roots and grow high. Besides, it is susceptible of greater heat from the sun than any other soil, which is apt to parch the plants. As this soil contains no oil, it must be very defective in vegetable food; and, as it has no absorbent quality, it will receive but a small supply from the air.\n\nFrom the qualities of this soil, the manures most proper for it are easily discovered. Clay will make it firmer, and enable it to retain the water; but clay contains little vegetable food. Dung will supply it with the food of plants; but will not render it firm, or make it retain water. Mofs will help it to retain water, and supply it with vegetable food; but will not make it firmer. A mixture of clay and dung, or of clay and mofs, seems therefore to be the most proper manure for this soil.\n\nThe qualities of a sandy soil composed of broken shells, are nearly the same with those of the former kind. The only differences are, that it ferments with acids, contains oil, and is capable of being dissolved. Hence this soil must have a larger quantity of vegetable food, and must also receive a greater supply from the air. A mixture of dung and clay, or of mofs and clay, is likewise the most proper manure for this soil: But if any substance could be found that could reduce the particles of the shells to a state of putrefaction, it would be preferable to anything hitherto known for improving a soil of this kind.\n\nOf the Mussy Soil.\n\nMoss principally consists either of live or at least uncorrupted vegetables. It must therefore have salt and oil in its composition. It does not easily putrefy, and prevents other bodies from putrefying. It swells with water like a sponge, and does not easily part with it.\n\nTo render the mossy soil fit for nourishing plants, the vegetables in it must be reduced to a state of putrefaction. This will not only supply it with vegetable food, but likewise render it firmer, and make it more easily part with water. Hence those manures which ferment most violently with acids, as the clay and stone marles, seem to be the most proper for this soil. These marles will not only raise a violent fermentation, but fill up the pores, and make the soil more solid. When the moss is deep, or has not a solid bottom, lime is improper, because it will soon penetrate beyond the reach of the plough; but, if it has a solid bottom, lime will answer very well.\n\nIt is improper to sow upon this soil till the fermentation raised by the manure is completely finished; for the violence of the fermentation sometimes throws the seeds, and even the roots, out of the ground.\n\nFrequent ploughings make the mossy soil run much into weeds; and from this circumstance, the practice of ploughing it but seldom is found to answer better.\n\nSect. IV. Of the Impediments to Vegetation.\n\n1. Weeds, as an Impediment to Vegetation.\n\nEvery vegetable that grows in a field, different from the particular plant that is intended to be cultivated, may be called a weed.\n\nWeeds injure the plants we desire to cultivate, by robbing them of part of their nourishment, and by preventing the spreading of their roots. Some weeds, as quickening grass, extend and interweave their roots in such a manner that it is difficult to pulverize the soil by tillage. It is therefore of great importance to the farmer to know how weeds may be destroyed. Weeds are generally divided into three classes, viz. those that are propagated by the seed; those that are propagated by the roots; and shrubs.\n\nOf destroying Weeds that are propagated by Seed.\n\nWeeds are very different in their natures. Some, if prevented from vegetating, die in a few years by lying moist in the earth; others will lie many years in this situation, without losing the power of vegetating.\n\nThe first kind may be destroyed, by turning the land infested with them into grass for five or six years; and both kinds may be rooted out by allowing them to vegetate, and then tearing up the young plants before they begin to flower.\n\nIn order to promote the vegetation of the weeds that are intended to be destroyed, the land ought to be well ploughed; if a little dung, or other manure, be applied, the crop of weeds will be increased, and their destruction will be rendered more general.\n\nSeveral weeds, as the thistle, dandelion, rag-weed, &c. are furnished with a kind of down, by which they float in the air, and are carried to great distances by the wind. Farmers should be as careful to root out all weeds of this kind from the roots of hedges, banks of fences, &c. as from their arable land; for although they may have the appearance of being inoffensive in that situation, they are transported from thence in great quantities by the wind into the adjacent fields.\n\nThere is another great source of weeds, but too little attended to by farmers. It is a general practice, to throw the seeds that are separated from the corn in winnowing upon the dung-hill; and by this means they are carried out with the dung, and again sown upon the land.\n\nOf destroying Weeds that are propagated by the Root.\n\nThere are many different kinds of weeds propagated by the roots. Some of them infest land that is in tillage, and others land that is in grass.\n\nThose that infest land in tillage may be destroyed by turning it into grass for some years. This is the most effectual\neffectual means of rooting out quicken-grafts, and other root-weeds of the same nature. If the soil be hard and stiff, it is the sooner cleared of weeds by being laid out in grafts; But a soft spongy soil requires to be in grafts six or seven years before the weeds are destroyed.\n\nThose weeds that infest lands in grafts, are easiest destroyed by turning the land into tillage. Neither is it necessary to continue it long in this situation; for the weeds commonly disappear after the first ploughing.\n\nBut as, in some cases, it may be inconvenient to turn a field infested with weeds from tillage into grafts, or from grafts into tillage, it is necessary to consider whether the same may not be accomplished, without altering the situation of the land.\n\nWhen land is in tillage, the weeds may be destroyed by frequently stirring and turning it over in dry weather; for when the weeds are displaced, the drought prevents them from taking root again.\n\nLand cannot be made too fine, nor the surface too smooth, when it is intended to be freed of seed-weeds; because by that the greatest number are brought to vegetate: But, when intended to be freed of root-weeds, the rougher the surface, the weeds are the more easily destroyed; because the drought has the easier access to their roots.\n\nIf graft-lands be infested with weeds, and it is inconvenient to turn them into tillage, the only way of destroying the weeds, is to cut them frequently, or pull them up by the roots.\n\nSome lands, after being in grafts a few years, are liable to be over-run with fog: In this case, rolling, by making the surface firmer, will be of great use in destroying the fog. This weed, as well as others, may be destroyed by depriving it of air. This may be done by covering the surface with a crop of peas, potatoes, or other plants that lie thick on the surface. A deep trenching will, in some cases, answer the same intention.\n\nOf Destroying Shrubs, as Furze, Broom, Bramble, &c.\n\n1. FURZE.\n\nThe common method of destroying furze (or whins) is by grubbing them out with a hoe. But it is impossible to root them out so completely as to prevent their springing again, especially if the land be continued in grafts. The most effectual method, therefore, is to bring the land into tillage immediately after the whins have been grubbed up. As long as it continues in tillage, no whins will appear; but if turned into grafts, they grow as numerous as ever.\n\nTo prevent this return of whins, the young plants that appear after the land is turned into grafts, should be pulled up by the roots. Unless they are very thick, this is neither troublesome nor expensive: When the ground is moist, it may be performed by young boys. If any of them rise afterwards, which is commonly the case, the same operation must be repeated every season till the land is completely cleared of them.\n\nThere is another scheme of management which in a few years will effectually destroy whins. It is certain that the seeds of whins will not vegetate unless they are allowed to lie in the earth undisturbed for a considerable time. As long as land is left in tillage, although there be many whin-seeds in it, yet they never vegetate. Whin-plants do not even appear till two years after the land has been allowed to rest, or has been turned into grafts. Now, if a scheme of management be followed, by which the land is turned from tillage into grafts, and from grafts into tillage, the whins by degrees will be wholly eradicated.\n\nIt was observed above, that before lands infested with whins can be improved, the whins must be grubbed up. This operation is both tedious and expensive. The following method of rooting them out by the plough is more expeditious, less expensive, and has been tried with success.\n\nThis work must be performed by a strong Scotch plough, with a well redd beam. As it requires great force to tear up the roots, six horses should be yoked in pairs. Two drivers are likewise necessary, to prevent the horses from stepping aside. As the whins in rising are apt to entangle or choke the beam, another man is also necessary to push them off with a pitch-fork. A plough yoked, and attended in this manner, will plow down whins near three feet high, with roots above four feet long, and an inch in diameter. This operation should be performed in the winter, when the land is well soaked with rain.\n\nAfter the land has been ploughed in this manner, it should be allowed to lie till summer, when the whins torn up by the plough may be burned, the land harrowed, and the roots gathered. Afterwards the land may be dressed according to the judgment of the farmer; only the second ploughing should be across, that any roots which have been left may be torn up.\n\nBut when the whins are so strong that it is impossible to plough them down, they may be burned; and if the land be allowed to lie a few years after, it may be ploughed without much difficulty.\n\n2. BROOM.\n\nBroom is not so bushy, and does not cover the surface so much as whins; and therefore land infested with it is more easily cleared. Though the methods recommended for destroying whins will most effectually destroy broom, a more simple and less expensive one will sufficiently answer the purpose.\n\nIf broom, especially when it is old, be cut so low as to take away all the leaves, it will never spring again. A kind of scythe has lately been invented, by which broom may be cut in this manner with great expedition. If this method be observed, it is unnecessary to bring land from grafts into tillage in order to clear it of broom.\n\n3. BRAMBLE.\n\nThis plant is of a very different nature from whin or broom. The root sinks deep into the earth, and spreads very wide. Though cut in the winter, it rises and comes to such perfection as to carry fruit in the summer.\nIt is therefore a difficult matter to clear land of bramble, especially when it is stony; for the bramble pushes and interweaves its roots among the stones, which renders it necessary to dig out the stones before it can be sufficiently rooted up by ploughing or tearing. However, digging out the stones, and ploughing the land in such a manner as is most proper for cutting and tearing up the roots of bramble, may be the more safely recommended, as they at the same time serve many other useful purposes.\n\n2. Of Water, as an Impediment to Vegetation.\n\nSome plants require a greater, and some a lesser proportion of water in their food. The plants usually cultivated in our fields are of the latter kind, and are easily injured by an over-proportion of water. Hence, water may be considered as an impediment to vegetation; and it becomes necessary to consider the most proper methods of conveying it off the land.\n\nOf draining Land.\n\nSome lands are wet from their situation, being exposed to overflowings from higher grounds, and having no proper descent to allow the water to run off.\n\nThe bottom of some land is of such a nature as to force out, in springs, the water that runs below the surface. Springs sometimes break out, because the channels, in which they run, reach the surface; and sometimes because they are interrupted in their course, which makes them force their way above ground.\n\nThe wetness of land is sometimes occasioned by violent and frequent rains; and sometimes all these causes may concur in rendering land wet.\n\nLand that is wet from its situation may be drained in this manner: Although the wet land be too low, as to render it difficult to carry off the water; yet the water may be intercepted by a drain, before it reaches the low ground.\n\nLand, wet by springs, lies generally in a sloping direction, which makes it the more easy to drain. When the water runs near the surface, before it breaks out, it may be intercepted by a drain drawn across the declivity, a little above the place where it first makes its appearance. But, if the channel lies deep, the drain should be drawn directly across where it springs up.\n\nBut, when the wetness of the land is owing to the climate, or a rainy season, the water cannot be interrupted by drains; however, obstructions may be removed, so as to allow the water to run off as quickly as possible. To drain land in this situation, it is necessary to lay it up in ridges properly placed, and to cut small drains across these ridges, communicating with each other, and with the furrows. By this method all the furrows between the ridges become drains; the water, as it falls upon the ridges, immediately makes its way to the furrows; and, if it meets with an interruption in any of them, it is conveyed by the drains across the ridges into some other furrow, along which it is carried off the field.\n\nThere are two kinds of drains, viz., open drains, and hollow drains. Hollow drains differ from open ones, in being filled with loose stones, covered with turf, brushwood, or straw, and a layer of earth thick enough to allow a plough to go easily through above. These hollow drains are attended with two advantages; no land is lost by them, and they are no impediment in ploughing.\n\nOpen drains, however, are in most cases preferable to hollow ones; they alone are capable of intercepting overflowings from higher grounds, and for carrying off water that falls in rain. The water in these cases being always on the surface, will run freely over hollow drains, especially when situated on a declivity. But hollow drains may be used with advantage in land wet by springs; because nothing more is required than to continue the channels of the water below ground, and not allow it to break out, till it arrives at a place where it can do no harm.\n\nIt will not be improper here to mention, that some soils retain water much longer than others, and consequently are more liable to be damaged by water. Soils that have a large proportion of clay, or of moss, are of this kind. As these soils naturally retain water like a sponge, casting drains, and laying the land up in ridges, will not convey it away. To drain such lands, their nature, and power of retaining water, must be changed by culture.\n\nThe clay-soil can only be drained by frequent stirring, and the application of such manures as raise a fermentation. These operations open the pores of the soil, and thereby afford a free passage to the water.\n\nThe mossy soil, on the other hand, is too open and porous, but is possessed of an absorbing quality, by which it retains the water. To drain this soil, it is necessary to condense it, and, if possible, to destroy its quality of retaining water. Frequent stirrings, and such manures as raise a fermentation, and tend to putrefy the moss, are said to render it firm and solid, and thereby both prevent it from receiving so large a quantity of water, and destroy the quality of retaining it.\n\nOf draining Marshes.\n\nThe soil of marshes, being composed of dissolved vegetables, dust blown in by the winds, and earth washed down from the high grounds with which they are generally surrounded, is light and spungy, but very rich and valuable when drained.\n\nIn draining a marsh, all the stagnating water should be first carried off by a large open drain, with a sufficient fall, and as deep as the bottom of the marsh. When the stagnating water is conveyed away, the earth by degrees will subside, and become solid; and some land will thus be gained on each side: The bottom likewise soon becomes firm enough to allow the drain to be gradually carried forward through the middle of the marsh. If the springs, which supply the water, rise near the middle of the marsh, this principal drain, with a few branches on each side, where the springs are largest or\nmost numerous, will be sufficient. But, if the springs be irregularly dispersed through the whole marsh, as is frequently the case, side-drains parallel to the principal one will be necessary to intercept the water that comes from the higher grounds and supplies the springs. Cross drains, communicating with the parallel and principal drains, are likewise necessary; and should all be kept open till the soil hath fully subsided, and become firm; then the side-drains and cross-drains may be converted into hollow-drains, in the manner above described. But the principal drain, especially if the marsh be extensive, should always remain open.\n\n**Sect. V. Of Tillage.**\n\n*Tillage* is the operation of breaking the soil into small particles, by stirring and turning it over, laying it up in ridges, &c. In this part of agriculture, it is necessary to be acquainted with the different tools proper for nourishing plants; the instruments best adapted for stirring and turning them over; and the construction and manner of using these instruments.\n\nSoils, with respect to tillage, may be divided into stiff and light, wet and dry, deep and shallow. This division is the more proper on this account, that the method of performing the operation of tillage has always a reference to one or more of these qualities of soil, and to no other.\n\nThe instruments employed in tillage are various; as the plough, the harrow, the roller, &c. which are again greatly diversified by differences arising from their construction and particular uses.\n\n1. Of the Scots Plough.\n\nIn Scotland, this plough is still the most common and the most generally understood. If properly made, it is the best plough for answering all purposes, when only one is used; though others are, perhaps, more proper for some particular purposes.\n\nThe parts of which this plough is composed are, the head, the beam, the sheath, the wrest, the mold-board, the two handles, the two rungs, the sock, and the coulter; the two last are made of iron, and all the rest of wood.\n\nThe Head, Plate VIII. fig. 1, is designed for opening the ground below. The length of the head from A to B is about twenty inches, and the breadth from A to D about five inches; C is the point upon which the sock is driven, and the length from B to C is about six inches; a is the mortise into which the larger handle is fixed; and b is the mortise into which the sheath is fixed.\n\nThe head is that part of the plough which goes in the ground; therefore the shorter and narrower it is, the friction will be the less, and the plough more easily drawn; but the longer the head is, the plough goes more steadily, and is not so easily put out of its direction by any obstructions that occur. Twenty inches is considered as a mean length; and five inches as the most convenient breadth.\n\nThe Sheath, fig. 2. E, is driven into the mortise, fig. 1. b, and thus fixed to the head A B. It is not perpendicular to the head, but placed obliquely, so as to make the angle formed by the lines A B and E B about 60 degrees. The sheath is about 13 inches long, besides what is driven into the mortise b; about three inches broad, and one inch thick.\n\nThe sheath is fixed to the mold-board, as in fig. 11. E, in the same manner as the wrest is fixed to the head in fig. 7.\n\nThe Mold-board is designed to turn over the earth of the furrow made by the plough; and it is obvious, that, according to the position of the sheath, the mold-board will turn over the earth of the furrow more or less suddenly. Besides, when it forms a less angle with the head than 60 degrees, the plough is in great danger of being choked, as the farmers term it.\n\nThe Larger Handle, fig. 3. F A, is fixed to the head, by driving it into the mortise a, fig. 1. It is placed in the same plane with the head; and its length from A F is about five feet four inches, and its diameter at the place where it is fixed to the beam is about two inches and a half, and tapers a little to the top F. About ten inches from A, there is a curve in the handle, which, when F is raised to its proper height, makes the lower part of it nearly parallel to the sheath E B. This curve is designed to strengthen the handle. The proper position of the handle is, when the top F is about three feet two inches higher than the bottom of the head A B.\n\nThe longer the handles, the plough is the more easily managed, because the levers are more distant from the centre of motion. The higher the top of the handles, the plough is more easily raised out of the ground, provided they be no higher than the lower part of a man's breast.\n\nThe Beam, fig. 4, is fixed to the larger handle and the sheath, all of which are placed in the same plane with the head. The length of it, from H to I, is about six feet; its diameter is about four inches. When the plough is in the ground, the beam should be just high enough not to be incommoded by anything on the surface.\n\nThe position of the beam depends on the number of cattle in the plough. When two horses are yoked, the beam should be placed in such a manner as to make the perpendicular distance between the bolt-hole of the beam and the plane of the head about 21 inches; when four horses are yoked, two abreast, this distance should only be about 18 inches.\n\nThe Sock, fig. 5. B P, is fixed to the end of the head, and is about two feet long. In fitting the sock to the head, the point ought to be turned a little to the land or left side; because otherwise, it is apt to come out of the land altogether. When turned to the left, it likewise takes off more land; when turned upwards, the plough goes shallow; and when downwards, it goes deeper.\n\nThe Coulter, fig. 6, is fixed to the beam, and is about two feet ten inches long, two inches and a half broad, sharp at the point and before, and thick on the back, like a knife. It is fixed and directed by wedges, so as to make the point of it equal to, or rather a little before\nbefore the point of the stock, and upon a line with the left side of the head. This oblique position enables it to throw roots, &c., out of the land, which requires less force than cutting or pushing them forward.\n\nThe WREST, fig. 7. BD, is fixed to the head, and is about 26 inches long, two broad, and one thick. It is fixed to the head at B, in such a manner as to make the angle contained between the lines AB and BD about 25 degrees. The wrest is seldom or never placed in the same plane with the head, but gradually raised from the place where it is fixed to it; that is, from B to K, as in fig. 8. The position of the wrest determines the nature of the furrow. When the wrest is wide and low set, the furrow is wide; and when it is narrow and high set, the furrow is narrow.\n\nFig. 9 represents the two Handles, fixed together by the two rungs. The larger handle has been already described; the lesser one is a few inches shorter, and does not require to be quite so strong. The distance of the handles at the little rung depends on the position of the wrest. Their distance at M and P is about two feet six inches. The lesser handle is fixed to the mold-board at M, fig. 10, and to the wrest KB, at L.\n\nFig. 11 represents the plough complete, by joining together figures 6, and 10, in the sheath EB. The wrest KB is supposed to make an angle with the head AB, as in fig. 7, and the handles joined together, as in fig. 9.\n\nAfter having given such a particular description of all the parts and proportions of the Scots plough, it will easily appear how it separates, raises, and turns over the earth of the furrow. If it had no coulter, the earth would open above the middle of the stock, and in a line before the sheath; but as the coulter opens the earth in a line with the left side of the head, if the soil has any cohesion, the earth of the furrow will be wholly raised from the left side, and as the stock moves forward, will be thrown on the right side of the sheath, and by the casting out of the mold-board, or the raising of the wrest, will be turned over.\n\nThis plough, though the best general one, is not altogether perfect. As the stock is high in the middle, and round on the sides, and as the point of it is in a line with the middle of the head, a great force is necessary to raise the earth of the furrow. Besides, as the sheath is nearly in a line with the point of the stock, and to the right of the left side of the head, the earth of the furrow, as it is raised, must strike against the sheath, and a part of it, instead of being turned wholly to the right, will fall to the left side. These defects make the plough heavy to draw; and, besides, this position of the sheath renders the Scots plough improper for hoeing, as the earth that falls to the left buries the young plants in the rows.\n\nTo remedy the defects arising from the stock, it should be made straight on the land-side, so as to be in a line with the land or left side of the head; and straight also below, so as to be in a line with the under side of the head, sloping on the furrow or left side; and likewise on the upper side from the point, so as to make it, at the root, about seven inches broad, and three inches thick; at the same time sloping all the way from the land to the furrow, so as to form the furrow-side into a sharp edge. It is obvious, that this stock will meet with less resistance than the common one, will raise the earth of the furrow wholly from the left side, and turn it as it is raised.\n\nTo remedy the defect arising from the sheath, it should be brought a little nearer the larger handle, and another sheath should be fixed a little before it, to the left or land-side of the head and beam; to this sheath the mold-board should be fixed. If this be done, the earth of the furrow, as it is raised, will be raised by the mold-board only, and wholly turned to the right.\n\nThe BRIDLE, or MUZZLE, is another article belonging to the plough. It is fixed to the end of the beam, and the cattle are yoked by it. The muzzle commonly used is a curved piece of iron, fixed to the beam by a bolt through it. In fig. 12. ABC is the muzzle, AC the bolt by which it is fixed to the beam; D is the swingle-tree, or crofs-tree, to which the traces are fixed; and B is a hook, or cleek, as it is commonly called, which joins the muzzle and swingle-tree.\n\nSome use another kind of muzzle, fig. 13. ABCD. It is fixed to the beam by two bolts, and has notches by which the cleek of the swingle-tree may be fixed either to the right or the left of the beam. There are also different holes for the hind-bolt to pass through, by which the draught may be fixed either above or below the beam. AD is the fore-bolt upon which the muzzle turns; on BC are four notches, betwixt any two of which the cleek of the swingle-tree may be fixed. When the cleek is fixed at B, the plough is turned towards the firm land, and takes off a broader furrow; and when fixed at C, it is turned towards the ploughed land, and takes off a narrower furrow. E and F are the holes on each side through which the hindmost bolt passes. When the bolt is put through the highest two, these holes being thereby brought to the middle of the beam, the fore-part of the muzzle is raised above the beam, and the plough is made to go deeper; and when put through the lowest two, the fore-part of the muzzle is sunk below the beam, and the plough is made to go shallower. This muzzle may be so constructed as to have the same play with the common one. Fig. 16. A is the end of the beam; B a plate of iron sunk into it, and, with a similar one in the other side, is riveted into it by bolts; C is the muzzle fixed to these plates of iron by the bolt D, which bolt may be put through any of the holes EE. From the construction of this muzzle it is plain, that it has the same play with the common one, and that by it the land of the plough may be altered at pleasure.\n\nOf the Plough with the curved Mold-board.\n\nThe mold-board of the Scots plough is not quite straight, but is cast out above, and more and more so as it approaches the lesser handle.\n\nPloughs with a curved mold-board commonly have no wrest, the mold-board serving for both. The under-part of it, which serves in place of the wrest, becomes parallel to the plane of the head as it approaches the handle; and sometimes, after it has passed the handle,\nis made to turn inwards; and the fore-part of it, which is straight below, is more and more curved the further up it comes, resembling the bow of a ship.\n\nIf one mold-board be preferable to another, it must be either because it throws the earth of the furrow more properly, or makes the plough more easily drawn. Now, the use of the mold-board is to raise the earth, turn it over, and, if it be taken off narrow, to shift it a little to the right hand. The common mold-board, when right made, performs all these operations gradually. But the curved mold-board, as it is cast out above in the fore-part, prevents the furrow from rising, and turns it over suddenly. In land that easily breaks in pieces, the common mold-board has the advantage, because it raises the earth of the furrow higher than the other, and leaves it more loose and open. But the curved mold-board is preferable in land that is not easily broke, for, by turning over the earth suddenly, it is apt to tear it asunder.\n\nThe plough is more easily drawn by the common mold-board, as it has less friction than the curved one.\n\nOf the Plough with the feathered Sock.\n\nThe difference between the feathered and the common sock will be best understood by comparing their figures. Fig. 14. is the common sock, and fig. 15. the feathered one.\n\nFrom the construction of the feathered sock, it is obvious, that it must meet with greater resistance than the common sock. However, when the plough takes off the earth of the furrow broader than that part of the sock which goes upon the head, it is more easily drawn than the plough with the common sock; for the earth which the common sock leaves to be opened by the wreath, is more easily opened by the feather of the other sock. In lean, the feathered sock makes the plough go more easily, because the roots of the grass, which go beyond the reach of the plough, are more easily cut by the feather than they can be torn asunder by the common sock. The feathered sock is also of great use in cutting and destroying root-weeds. The common sock, however, answers much better in strong land.\n\nIt is proper here to add, that in fitting the feathered sock to the head, the point of it should be turned a little from the land, or a little to the right hand.\n\nOf the Wheeled Plough.\n\nThe Scots wheeled plough is formed by adding wheels to the old Scots plough, and giving it a curved mold-board, or feathered fork, according to the inclination of the farmer. The advantage or disadvantage of the wheels is therefore the only thing to be considered in this place.\n\nThe following are the principal advantages of wheels to a plough of this kind. Wheels regulate the plough; they make it go to a certain depth, take off the earth of the furrow of a determinate breadth, and make the plough very easy to manage. Wheels likewise make it easy for the ploughman to keep the ridges straight, which it is difficult to do without them.\n\nThe disadvantages attending a wheeled plough are nearly equal to its advantages. It has too much machinery, which is an inconvenience in any instrument. It is improper for ploughing ridges across. It is also very inconvenient for ploughing narrow ridges; for it must be frequently altered in ploughing out a ridge. The wheel that goes in the furrow being higher than the other, when both wheels are going upon the surface, the beam must be changed from its ordinary position, and placed in such a manner as to keep the plough even, and to make it go a little deeper than ordinary. When a furrow is made for the wheel to go in, the beam must be altered again to its ordinary position; and when the ridge is near finished, so that both wheels are going in furrows, the position of the beam must be changed, to keep the plough even, and to prevent it from going too deep.\n\nOf the Four-coulted Plough.\n\nIn England, this plough is said to be used with success. But after repeated trials by those who attempted to use it in Scotland, they have been obliged to give it up.\n\nSo many coulters in the ground at once must meet with many obstructions, which will give different directions to the plough, according to the different parts of the coulters to which the resistance is applied. Besides, it is difficult to place the planes of the coulters exactly parallel to each other; and if this be not done, they will be continually acting upon the plough in different directions. When this plough is employed for breaking up grass-grounds, which is the chief design of it, the oblique position of the coulters is apt to raise the turf in such a manner as to entangle it betwixt them, and thereby entirely stop the plough.\n\nThis plough should always be made with wheels for regulating its direction; the planes of the coulters should be exactly parallel to each other: The first coulter must be set almost perpendicular, and should not go above two inches deep; the second should slope a little, and go somewhat deeper than the first, and so on to the last.\n\nSoft meadow-land, free from stones, is best adapted to the nature of this plough.\n\nOf the Iron Plough.\n\nThis plough is formed upon the model of the old Scots plough; only the several parts of it are shorter, and the head and fork are of one piece like the English plough-share.\n\nThis plough is lighter, and consequently more easily drawn than any other plough used in Scotland; and, as it is shorter, the friction is also diminished. Neither is the earth so apt to stick to it, and cling while going. But these are only seeming advantages; for the lightness and shortness of it render it extremely subject to change its direction upon meeting with the least obstruction. Soft land,\nland, with few stones, therefore, is the only land in which it can be employed with advantage.\n\nThe iron-plough is subject to another inconvenience. When anything goes wrong, it cannot be rectified on the field, but must be carried to the smithy, which is often at a considerable distance.\n\nOf yoking Cattle in Ploughs.\n\nIt is not easy to determine whether horses or oxen, or both together, are most proper for drawing ploughs; because, in this country, such a determination depends on circumstances almost as various as the number and situation of farms in it. If, indeed, real labour alone was sufficient to determine this point, oxen would be preferred; because they will stand to the draught, and overcome a resistance which horses would yield to. We shall therefore confine this head to the manner of yoking cattle, without regard to the kind of cattle employed.\n\nThe chief question on this subject is, Whether cattle should be yoked in pairs, or in a line before one another?\n\nThe most common way of yoking cattle is in pairs. Though this, upon the whole, be the best method, yet it is subject to some disadvantages. In ploughing the furrows betwixt the ridges, the cattle go upon the ploughed land, and tread it down with their feet, which is peculiarly hurtful to wet land: When there is but as much of the ridge unploughed as the cattle have hardly room to go upon, they frequently give the plough a wrong direction by going into the opposite furrow; or, which is still worse, they are apt to juggle the furrow-cattle upon the ploughed land.\n\nTo remove these inconveniences, yoking the cattle in a line has been recommended. But this method has been attended with greater inconveniences than those it is intended to remedy. When yoked in this manner, they go all in the furrow, which makes it necessary to give the plough more land than ordinary, either by means of the stock or muzzle; and consequently makes the draught too heavy. Besides, when cattle are yoked in a line, it gives some of them an opportunity of throwing the chief burden upon the others. There is still another inconvenience attends this method. When the cattle are all in a line, the whole force is applied to the direction of the traces of the hindmost horse; and consequently it cannot have such an effect on the plough as when a part of it is in a more horizontal direction.\n\nEach of these methods, however, may be used with advantage in certain circumstances; yoking in pairs, as it is certainly the strongest draught, should be preferred in ploughing stiff land. On the other hand, yoking in a line answers best in wet land, which is liable to be much hurt by the treading of the cattle.\n\nOf Ploughing.\n\nPloughing is the action of the plough in stirring and turning over the soil. By opening the soil and enlarging the surface, it gives it an opportunity of extracting the vegetable food from the air; and consequently increases the food of plants. Ploughing likewise dissolves and reduces to a state of putrefaction the dung, oils, and vegetable substances that happen to be mixed with the soil, and prepares them for entering the roots of plants. When properly managed, ploughing destroys weeds, and drains the land when too wet. Hence, ploughing is one of the most important operations in agriculture, and therefore merits the greatest attention.\n\nWhen ploughing is designed to enrich the land, or increase the food of plants, the surface cannot be made too uneven; because the more of it is by this means exposed to the influence of the air.\n\nBut when the intention of ploughing is to destroy feed-weeds, the surface cannot be made too smooth, nor the mould too much broken; because, by this management, their vegetation is promoted, and consequently they may be more completely destroyed by ploughing them in.\n\nAgain, if you plough with a view to remove wetness, the land must be laid up in high ridges; for the greater the number of furrows, and the higher the ridges, the water is more expeditiously carried off.\n\nThus the manner of ploughing must always depend on the object in view. It frequently happens indeed, that two or more of these objects require our attention in ploughing the same piece of land. But the methods above mentioned are perfectly consistent with each, and may be combined so as to answer any intention that may occur.\n\nIn ploughing, there are some general rules to be observed, whatever be the object in view. Thus, land should never be ploughed when it is wet, because the intention of it will be frustrated, whatever may be the nature of the soil. A stiff soil, when ploughed wet, dries suddenly, and becomes hard. If a light soil be ploughed wet, the water hinders it from being reduced to small enough particles. Besides these disadvantages, the labour becomes very severe on the cattle, and the land is much hurt by their treading.\n\nWith regard to ploughing lee, or opening up grass-grounds, the common practice in Scotland is to plough it as shallow and narrow as possible, and to set the turf upon its edge. After this single furrow, the land is fown, and if it be good, a profitable crop may be expected; and the turf will be completely rotten before, next season.\n\nOn the contrary, in breaking up of barren land, it should be ploughed deep, and the turf turned on its back.\n\nOf Ridges.\n\nIt was formerly observed, that ploughing in ridges removes wetness, enlarges the surface, and consequently affords more space for the plants to extract nourishment from the soil.\n\nWhen the soil is wet, the ridges ought to be narrow, and steep; because, by this means, the number of drains is increased, and the water finds its way more easily into the furrows. They should likewise be raised high in the middle\nmiddle or crown; for the higher they are raised, the more is the surface enlarged. However, if the soil be shallow, the ridges should not be raised high, as they deprive the furrows of soil.\n\nBut, in low flat-lying ground, the ridges should be made flat, in order to raise the furrows; for, in some cases, the higher the furrows are raised, it is the more easy to find a fall for carrying off the water. Flat ridges are also capable of being sown with greater exactness.\n\nIt is impracticable to give any general rule for laying out ridges. In some situations, narrow ridges are preferable to broad ones; in others, flat ridges are better than steep ones, &c. In laying out of ridges, therefore, every person must be determined in this point by the nature and situation of the soil, and the advantages or disadvantages of the different kinds of ridges.\n\nBut, whatever be the nature or situation of the soil, the ridges should always be made straight. In ploughing crooked ridges, the cattle must often go in a different direction from the plough, and are obliged to take short turnings, which hurt the land by the treading of the cattle. Besides, when the ridges are crooked, the fall for the water is diminished. In all soils too, the ridges should be made of the same breadth throughout, and equal to one another. When they are unequal, it is difficult to sow them with exactness, or to alter them when necessary; and the plough must often turn in the middle of the ridge, which hurts the land by the trampling of the cattle.\n\nOf the Position of the Ridges.\n\nIt is a matter of some consequence to know how ridges should be placed, so as best to answer the situation of the land.\n\nIn lands that have a slope, the ridges are commonly placed in a straight line from the top to the bottom of the declivity. When the declivity is gentle, this position is very proper, as it drains the land of water. But when the declivity is great, this position allows the soil to be washed away by the rain; and the quantity of soil carried off will always be in proportion to the violence with which the current runs: Hence, in a soil situated in this manner, the ridges should be placed across the declivity, to prevent the soil from being carried down by the water. Making the ridges very narrow will, in a good measure, answer the same purpose; however, it is not so proper as placing them across the declivity.\n\nWhen land is very dry, cross ridges are also of great use; for they retain the water, and prevent the soil from being washed away.\n\nOf Ploughing in Ridges.\n\nThere are three different ways of ploughing in ridges, viz. gathering, casting, and cleaving.\n\nBy gathering, the crown and furrows of the ridge are kept in the same position in which they were before: the plough begins in the crown, and plows out the ridge, turning the earth towards the crown, where it first enters. Every ridge is ploughed by itself; or the halves of two contiguous ridges may be ploughed together. By this method, as the earth on each side is turned upon the crown, and thrown up out of the furrows, the ridge must be raised higher.\n\nBy casting, the crowns and furrows are likewise kept in their former position: The ridges are ploughed in pairs: The plough may enter in the furrow betwixt the ridges, and plough out the ridges, turning the earth towards the furrow where it entered; or, the plough may enter in the furrow on the right-side of the two ridges, then turn to the one on the left, and plough out the ridges, turning the earth to these furrows, and from the furrow that is betwixt them. By this method of ploughing, the ridges are kept of the same height in the crown, and one of the furrows made a little higher, and the other a little lower than before.\n\nCleaving is the reverse of gathering. The plough enters in the furrow on the right-side of the ridge, turns to the furrow on the left-side, and ploughs out the ridge, turning the earth from the crown towards the furrows. Every ridge is ploughed by itself, or the halves of two contiguous ridges may be ploughed together. If the ridge be raised in the crown, this method of ploughing makes it flatter, by throwing some of it into the furrows.\n\nThere is another method of ploughing used in some places, called ribbing. This method is performed by making furrows about two feet distant from each other. One half of the surface is untouched by the plough; and the other half, which the plough turns up in making the furrows, is thrown on the top of what remains last. The land may be ploughed in this manner either without regard to ridges, or the plough may be made to enter and turn, as in gathering, casting, or cleaving. This kind of ploughing is seldom practised, but in the beginning of winter, and upon land to be sown with barley, after two additional clean ploughings. Although some modern improvers have condemned ribbing, it certainly has its uses: It keeps the land dry; the rain that falls is confined to the furrows, from whence it is easily carried off; it promotes the rotting of the stubble, and exposes a greater part of the soil to the influence of the air.\n\nOf Harrows.\n\nThe harrow is an instrument employed for smoothing the surface after the land is ploughed. One horse is sufficient to draw the harrow commonly used in Scotland. Sometimes two of them go abreast, and sometimes three. When the surface is very rough, two are reckoned sufficient for the attention of one person: But when three can be used, they make better work, and are nearly equal to two pair.\n\nThere are several kinds of harrows used in Scotland. The common one is so well known that it needs no description.\n\nWhen the land is rough, the harrows are apt to start, and get a-top of each other. To prevent this, some fix pieces of crooked timber to the outside bulls that are contiguous to one another, which, by stretching a little over,\nover, keep the harrows in their proper place. Others couple the harrows in such a manner as to allow them to go before and fall back of each other, and at the same time turn upon a hinge.\n\nWhen stiff land is ploughed wet, it rises in large pieces, which, when dry, become so hard, that the common harrows make no impression on them. To reduce this kind of land, a large harrow, called a break, has been contrived. The break-harrow is sometimes made of the same figure with the common harrow, and sometimes in a triangular form. Both kinds are made heavier or lighter according to the nature of the soil for which they are intended. Some of them are so heavy as to require six or eight cattle to draw them. But the heaviest kind are very improper for land infested with large salt stones; because their weight hinders them from starting over the stones; and therefore they are often in danger of being torn asunder by the cattle.\n\nThere is another harrow, which, though little used, will be found to be very useful in many cases. It is of the same form with the common harrow, but much broader. The bulls are at a greater distance, and consequently the teeth thinner placed; the teeth are longer than those of the common harrow, but very little thicker; and those in the fore-part slope forward. It is made of such a weight as to be easily drawn by a couple of horses. This harrow goes deeper, opens land better, covers the seed deeper, and is more proper for tearing up roots than the common harrow.\n\nThe French harrow is of a triangular form, with a joint near the angle, to which the draught is fixed. It has two handles, by which it is either made to go deep or shallow, as occasion requires. Its principal use is to level steep ridges, which it does most effectually. It is drawn across the ridges; When, at the crown of the ridge, by pressing on the handles, the harrow sinks down, and carries earth along with it to the furrows; and, when at the furrows, by lifting up the handles, the harrow is brought out of the ground, and leaves the earth behind. This operation, however, is extremely improper, unless the land be in a very dry situation, and not liable to be damaged by water.\n\nOf Harrowing.\n\nHarrowing smooths the surface, destroys weeds, and covers the seed after it is sown.\n\nWhen the intention of harrowing is to destroy root-weeds, the harrows should be drawn across the ridges. However, if such weeds are not fully torn up, the harrowing, by filling up the hollows, and defending the roots from the drought, rather promotes their growth. For this reason, harrowing is improper for destroying root-weeds, excepting after a spring-fallow, when the land is soon after to be ploughed for seed.\n\nBut the smoother the surface is made, and the more the mould is broke, the vegetation of the seed-weeds is the more effectually promoted, and of course they are the more liable to be destroyed by harrowing. If the season be favourable, the land may be harrowed several times, and as many crops of weeds destroyed.\n\nA light spungy soil can hardly get too much harrowing; for the more it is harrowed, it becomes the firmer. But if the soil be stiff, the less harrowing it gets, the better, provided the purposes proposed can be answered.\n\nThe common method of harrowing after the seed is sown, is first along the ridges, then across, and then along again. When the ridges are flat, they may be harrowed either along or across; and the work may be begun or ended either way. But when the ridges are steep, it is improper to begin by harrowing across, because too much of the seed will be drawn into the furrows.\n\nOf the Roller.\n\nThe roller is intended for smoothing the surface, and making the land firmer. Rollers are sometimes made of stone, sometimes of wood, and sometimes of iron; but the only essential difference of rollers lies in their weight. As rollers, in different circumstances, require to be lighter and heavier, they are generally constructed so that their weight can either be augmented or diminished.\n\nThe common roller, in turning, is very severe upon the cattle, for it does not move on its axis, but is dragged along the surface. To remove this inconvenience, a roller has lately been constructed with a division in the middle, as if two rollers were joined together. In turning, both parts of this roller move round their axis, the one forward, and the other back.\n\nOf Rolling.\n\nRolling is practised with advantage, both on land lying in grass, and in tillage. It presses down molehills, smooths the surface, and makes pasture-grass stool, and grow thicker.\n\nRolling upon land in tillage, not only smooths the surface, but breaks clods that the harrow cannot reduce. In a light soil, the roller should be applied immediately after the seed is sown; it is peculiarly useful to this kind of soil, by condensing and making it firmer.\n\nOf Sowing.\n\nIt is remarked by farmers, that the corn which is earliest sown is in general soonest ripe. However, as this operation depends on the nature of the weather, and a number of other circumstances, no precise time can be fixed for performing it.\n\nThe practice of sowing wheat, oats, barley, &c., at different times of the year, seems not to depend so much on the different natures of these grains, as on the inconveniences which would attend the sowing them all at the same time. It may however be observed, that wheat, the only grain in this country which is sown before winter, should be sown as early as possible, that its roots and leaves may be put forth before the frost comes on.\n\nThe most common method of sowing is by the hand. This method requires great skill and address in the sower; For, at the same time that he gives his arm a circular motion, to cast the seed with strength, he must open his hand...\nhand gradually, that it may not fall in a heap, but be properly scattered and spread. It is remarkable, that good fowers, by the force of habit, take their handful out of the sheet so very exactly, that they will sow any quantity of seed on an acre, according as it is designed to be thinner or thicker. But this dexterity in a few fowers, is itself an objection to the method of sowing by the hand; because long practice and observation are necessary to make a good fower: This remark is too well justified by experience; for good fowers are extremely rare, and, in some places of the country, hardly to be got. Besides, in sowing by the hand, especially when the land is uneven, the seed rebounds on the clods, falls into the cavities, and often the greatest part of it is collected in the furrows.\n\nDifferent plants require to be sown at different depths. The same seeds, however, may be laid deeper in light than in strong soils. Wheat requires to be placed two inches and a half or three inches below the surface: And it may be laid down as a general maxim in sowing, that small seeds should always be placed nearer the surface than such as are larger. Besides the unequal distribution of the seed when sown by the hand, too large a quantity of it may be used; for, as it is placed at different depths, that which is too deep never comes up, and that which lies on the surface, which may be observed on the best harrowed land, is eaten up by the birds. When seed is sown thin, and placed at equal distances by a drill, a lesser quantity of it, by leaving room to spread and branch out, will produce even a better crop than a larger quantity sown irregularly by the hand. The fact has been confirmed by repeated experiments both in our own country and in France.\n\nSect. VI. Of the Culture of Particular Plants.\n\nOf the Culture of Wheat.\n\nThough wheat be the most valuable grain that is cultivated in Scotland, there are many places where it cannot be sown with advantage; for it requires not only a rich soil, but a warm climate.\n\nThe English writers mention about 13 or 14 different kinds of wheat; but in Scotland we seldom use more than two, viz. the white and the red wheat. The last is reckoned the most hardy plant, and succeeds in some soils and climates where the white kind fails. Bearded wheat is used in some places. This is likewise a hardy plant, and is not so apt to lodge, or to be shaken out by the wind, as the other kinds. It succeeds very well in wet land, and the grain produces a great quantity of flour.\n\nThe white wheat most commonly used in Scotland, is not a particular species, but a mixture of all the species cultivated in England. This mixture is probably occasioned by want of care in providing ourselves with foreign seed. It is found by experience, that, in this country at least, wheat degenerates; for which reason a fresh supply is every year brought from the English granaries, which generally consists of a mixture of all the kinds. Now it is at least very probable, that these different kinds of wheat require different soils; and therefore the farmer should endeavour to provide himself annually with a quantity of unmixed wheat, of such kinds as are found to succeed best in Scotland.\n\nWheat is commonly sown either upon land that has been summer-fallowed, or after a crop of peas. In the latter case, the seed cannot be sown till October; but in the former, it is generally sown in August. However, in Scotland, we sow wheat from the beginning of August till the middle of November. Some have tried sowing wheat in the spring; but the plants were neither so vigorous, nor the grain so large, as those that were sown in autumn. The sowing of oats in autumn has likewise been tried; but, though the crop was bulky, the quantity of grain was not in proportion. Upon the whole, the month of October seems to be the most proper time for sowing wheat; when it is either earlier or later, it is subject to a number of dangers.\n\nThe quantity usually sown upon a Scots acre, is from three to five firlots, Linlithgow measure, which is the measure always meant in this treatise. The proper quantity, however, must always depend upon the situation of the land: in proportion as it is clean and rich, a smaller quantity of seed is requisite; and in proportion as it is poor and full of weeds, a larger quantity becomes necessary.\n\nA wet bed is most proper for wheat-feed. In the month of August, or even the beginning of September, it is dangerous to sow, if there be not as much moisture in the land as to make the seed vegetate, especially if the seed has been steeped in brine, and dried with lime. But though the danger be great in sowing when the land is very dry, yet the best situation of land for receiving seed is when it contains no more moisture than is sufficient to make the seed vegetate.\n\nWhen wheat-land is light, or well reduced by fallowing, the seed should be ploughed in, or the land allowed to lie some time after it is ploughed before the wheat be sown. By this the land acquires a degree of firmness before the harrows go upon it, and the feet of the cattle are prevented from pressing the seed too deep into it.\n\nWheat-land should be ploughed so as to raise the ridges higher in the crown than is necessary on other occasions, in order to prevent it from being damaged by water: If the ridges are made narrower than ordinary, the same end will be served, because the water finds its way more easily to the furrows. Hence the old practice in Scotland, of cleaving for peas, and gathering for wheat, was well founded.\n\nWhen the wheat is sown, and the land harrowed, the field should be carefully water-furrowed; and if there be ridges at the ends for the ploughs to turn upon in ploughing, a water-furrow should likewise be drawn betwixt them and the ridges, and the communication betwixt these and the furrows opened up.\nOf the Culture of Rye.\n\nRye is a winter-grain, and thrives very well on land that is improper for wheat. As there is hardly a good market for this grain in Scotland, it is but little cultivated. In some places, the land is prepared for it by a fallow, and good crops are reaped in this way. It may be sown in October, November, or early in the spring. It may be sown after pease or barley; but it is improper to sow it after wheat or oats, as this would encourage the growth of root-weeds, and greatly exhaust the land.\n\nRye is sometimes sown as a grass-feed. If it be sown with this view in September, upon a well-prepared fallow, it will afford good feeding for sheep in March and April; and after it is cut down, the land may be ploughed, and sown with barley. This practice, however, will not answer in wet land.\n\nOf the Culture of Barley.\n\nThere are four kinds of barley used in Scotland, the common barley, the Lincolnshire barley, the Highland barley, more commonly called rough bear, and the Thanet.\n\nThese different kinds are sown at different seasons. The Lincolnshire barley may be sown any time during the winter, or in the spring; the common barley and Thanet may be sown in April, the beginning of May, or even later; and the rough bear may be sown in May, or the beginning of June: but the precise time of sowing must be determined by the weather and the situation of the land. When the season is favourable, the land free from weeds, and not too wet, Lincolnshire barley may be sown in February, and the other kinds sooner than the periods above mentioned.\n\nWhen barley is sown in winter, or early in the spring, the land ought to be ploughed some time before; but when sown late in the spring, or in the beginning of summer, it ought to be sown immediately after it is ploughed. In winter, or early in the spring, land is in no danger of becoming too dry; but in summer, land is very liable to become too dry for the purposes of vegetation. The farmer should therefore endeavour to have all his seed sown before the season be too far advanced.\n\nThe quantity of barley sown on an acre is from two to four furlongs. When the land is clean and rich, two furlongs are sufficient; but when it is infested with weeds, a larger quantity is necessary.\n\nBarley has tender roots, and is not able to push them far in quest of food; it is therefore necessary to bring land destined for barley into good tilth, and to enrich it either by manures or frequent ploughings. Barley is often sown upon land that has been fallowed, or after a crop of pease. In some places it is sown after a crop of oats; and sometimes it is repeated for two or three years successively upon the same land.\n\nWhen barley is to be sown upon fallow, in stiff land not much infested with annual weeds, it should be dressed in November in the same manner as for wheat; so that Lincolnshire barley may be sown, if the winter be favourable, or spring barley upon the winter-furrow, if the season proves unfavourable. But when barley is to be sown after wheat, pease, or oats, the land should be ploughed as soon after harvest as possible, and laid up in such a manner as to be best exposed to the air and frost, and to secure it against damage from rain. To answer these purposes, barley-land is sometimes ribbed at this season: But ribbing takes only a small quantity of the soil; and therefore it is better to gather it into narrow ridges of four or five furrows each, and to make proper drains for carrying off the water. As the first ploughing for barley-land is designed to cover the stubble, increase the vegetable food, and keep the land dry, it need not be very deep, but ought to be as broad as possible, provided it be clean ploughed.\n\nIf it be proposed to dung barley-land, the dung may be laid on during the winter-frost, and ploughed in as soon as the land is in proper condition. When the dunging is delayed till immediately before the last ploughing, or feed-furrow, the land, especially if it be of a stiff nature, is in danger of being battered so as to rise in large clods when ploughed.\n\nIn steaming, the ploughing should be as deep as the plough can go, and the soil allows: For by deep ploughing at this season, part of the earth that has been exposed to the air through the winter, and part of it turned up by the ordinary ploughing, are mixed together for the nourishment of the crop. In steaming, the furrows should not be so broad as in the former ploughing; on the contrary, the narrower they are the better. Cross-ploughing is very proper at this season, if the land be so dry as to allow it.\n\nAfter steaming, the land should be well harrowed. It makes the weeds spring, retains the sap, and, if the land be tolerably dry, takes out the roots of the quickening-grass. But, if the land be in no danger of losing the sap, the harrowing may be delayed for some time after it is ploughed; for by this method a greater number of weeds are destroyed.\n\nThough, in general, frequent ploughings are beneficial, yet ploughing when the land is wet is destructive. When the spring is wet, the barley-land in many places is not in a proper condition to be sown. In this case, the steaming-furrow must be omitted, and the land should get the feed-furrow as soon as it is in a proper condition.\n\nWhen barley is to be sown a second time upon the same land, without any other crop intervening, two ploughings are sufficient.\n\nAs our summers in Scotland are sometimes very wet, barley-land should be water-furrowed, and dressed up in the same manner as wheat-land.\n\nOf the Culture of Oats.\n\nThe oat is a very hardy plant, and its roots are strong, which enables it to procure food where many other plants would starve; and hence the practice of giving less culture to oats than to any other grain.\n\nThere are three kinds of oats used in Scotland, the white, the black, and the grey. The white is the most common,\ncommon; and used in all the low countries; the black is the hardest, and is used in the cold hilly countries; and the grey is often sown with succulents upon light gravel or sand. The white is again divided into two kinds, called cold seed and hot seed. There is scarcely any difference in appearance between these; but the hot seed ripens eight or ten days before the cold. Experience must determine which of them ought to be chosen for seed.\n\nThough the oat be a hardy plant, and does not easily degenerate, yet the changing of seed is universally allowed to be a good practice. This change should always be made from a warm soil to a cold, and from a cold to a warm.\n\nOats are often sown upon grass-ground newly broken up, or, which is the same thing, upon lea once ploughed. They are likewise often sown after barley, sometimes after wheat, sometimes upon fallow, and sometimes they are repeated for several years successively upon the same land.\n\nIn ploughing lea for oats, when the land is soft and mellow, the plough should go as shallow as possible; and the earth of the furrows should be set upon its edges, to allow the harrows to have the greater impression in tearing it. But when the land is stiff, or the turf very tough, it is necessary to plough deeper, and to turn the turf fully over, so that the harrows may raise a kind of mold upon its back to fill up the hollows, and to nourish the seeds. When oats are to be sown upon lea, the land ought to be ploughed early in winter, that it may receive the greatest benefit from the air and frosts.\n\nIt is usual to lime lea-ground intended for oats. This is a very good custom; for lime promotes the corruption of the grass-roots, by which the land is sooner reduced. It is likewise common to spread the lime upon the sward some time before the land is ploughed; this is also very proper; for the lime is entangled in the sward, and is not apt to penetrate too deep.\n\nOats are generally sown after barley; and the land is ploughed as soon as the wheat-feed is made, and the barley-land has got the first furrow. The stiff land, and land in danger of being damaged by wetness, should be first ploughed, to give the one the benefit of the winter-frost, and to put the other out of danger. It is likewise an advantage to light and dry land to be ploughed early in the season, as it makes the stubble root sooner, and exposes the soil longer to the air.\n\nIt was formerly observed, that oats are sometimes sown upon fallow. In the hilly countries, they often follow the land that has been in lea for some years; and they find that this practice does better than giving it only one ploughing in the winter before the seed is sown. In the low countries, this practice of fallowing for oats is found to succeed very well. The fallow for oats should be managed through the summer in the same manner as if for barley or wheat. Before winter, it ought to get the last furrow, and be laid up in proper ridges, to preserve it dry during the winter.\n\nOats may be sown in any of the winter-months, or in the month of March. Some people have sown oats so early as the beginning of November, and have had good crops. But, if the land be properly laid up in winter, it is better to delay the sowing till March.\n\nThe quantity of oats generally sown upon an acre, is from four to five furlongs; and should always get a dry bed.\n\nOf the Culture of Pease.\n\nThe pea is a grain very different from any of those already mentioned. A crop of it is not so valuable, though it is much used in some places for bread.\n\nThe straw of pease is reckoned better for feeding horses than the straw of any other grain. A crop of pease does not require such a quantity of nourishment as a crop of any of the other grains mentioned above. When the crop is good, the straw covers the ground, and destroys all the small weeds by depriving them of a free communication with the air. Pease likewise minutely divide the particles of the soil; besides, they push their roots much deeper than any of the white grains, and extract part of their nourishment from below the reach of the plough.\n\nThere are two kinds of pease cultivated in Scotland, the white and the grey. The white is most common, and consists generally of a mixture of several kinds. All of these kinds seem to be species of the pea cultivated in our gardens. The grey pea seems to be a species of the vetch or tare. This is the hardiest plant of the two, and thrives on soils where the white pea does not succeed.\n\nThe straw of the grey pease, and the pease themselves, are better for horses than those of the white. The farmer should therefore cultivate this pea where the other does not thrive, although the value of the grain be inferior.\n\nThe white pea, like the oats, is divided into hot seed and cold seed. The sowing of the hot seed may be delayed three weeks after the cold seed is sown, and yet the pease will come as soon to maturity.\n\nThe time of sowing is from the first of February to the end of April. The early sown pease have the best chance to produce a crop of corn, and the late sown to produce a crop of straw. However, when the land is clean and in good heart, the pease may be sown early; because, on such land, a good crop both of corn and straw may be expected. But if the land be foul or wet, the sowing of pease should be delayed, as long as possible; because on such land the crop is more precarious, and the failing of a crop of pease gives such encouragement to weeds, as to endanger the following crops likewise. In such a case, to prevent the bad consequences that may follow, the crop should be ploughed in; for when a bad crop of pease is allowed to stand, it does more harm to the land than all the value of the crop.\n\nThe quantity of pease sown upon an acre, is from 4 to 5\u00bd furlongs. If the intention of sowing pease be to obtain straw, and enrich the land, they should be thick sown; because in that case they have a better chance to destroy the weeds, and to cover the surface. But when the principal design is to have a crop of corn, they should be thinner sown; for, when thin sown, they have more air, and fill better.\n\nPease are commonly sown after oats or barley, and sometimes\nsometimes after wheat. Seldom more than one ploughing is given to peas, and they are usually sown immediately after it. The reason of this practice is, that the seed may be better covered; for the sooner that any grain is sown after ploughing, it is always the deeper covered. If rain falls soon after peas are sown, it makes them swell and come above ground, and then they are in danger of splitting, and of being destroyed by vermin.\n\nSometimes peas are sown and ploughed in. This answers very well in light land, particularly after a crop of barley, the culture of which opens the soil.\n\nLand designed for peas is generally cloven. This is a good practice when the ridges are steep, as all of them were formerly. As wheat or barley are commonly sown after peas, the land must be ploughed before winter. Gathering is the most proper way of ploughing before winter, and this follows best after cleaving. But if the ridges be not high, casting is the best method of ploughing for peas; or, if the ridges be flat and narrow, the land may be ploughed in the ordinary way, reverting the former ploughing, and turning the furrows into the crowns. Though peas are generally the lowest-priced grain, yet sometimes they rise to a great price, when the prices of other grains are moderate. This makes the saving of seed an article of great importance. By sowing in drills, one furlot will serve for an acre as completely as four in the broad cast-way: But the advantages of drilling fall to be considered afterwards.\n\nOf the Culture of Beans.\n\nWhat has been said with regard to the culture of peas, may be applied to beans. However, it is necessary to observe, that the bean pushes its roots further down than the pea; and therefore requires a deeper soil. The lands in Scotland, where beans are most commonly sown, and where they succeed best, are deep and wet clays.\n\nIn some lands, the crops of beans are very great, and almost as valuable as any grain. There is no crop succeeds better in the drill-husbandry than a crop of beans.\n\nOf the Culture of Rye-grafts.\n\nRye-grass is the most common of all the artificial grasses cultivated in Scotland, and not the least valuable. It is a fibrous-rooted plant, and binds the soil; this circumstance has led many to think, that it greatly impoverishes land. However, the culture of this grass is attended with several peculiar advantages. It destroys weeds, particularly the quickening-grafts, and grows upon soils which will not answer for any of the other artificial grasses. A shallow, wet, spungy soil, or one which has a mixture of moss in it, is unfit for clover of every kind; but experience shows, that rye-grafts, when unmixed with clover, will succeed upon any of these soils.\n\nRye-grafts is usually sown along with a crop of barley or oats. When sown along with barley, the field should be rolled, or well harrowed, to preserve the sap at the dry season of the barley-feed. This precaution is not so necessary, when the rye-grafts is sown along with oats; because the land on which oats are sown is generally firmer, the sowing season is earlier, and consequently not so liable to be too dry.\n\nThis graft seldom hurts the crop of corn. On the contrary, when the soil is loose and open, it makes it firm, and prevents the corn from lodging.\n\nThough the common method is to sow rye-grafts with corn, yet, when the land is poor, it is better to sow it by itself, and still better to summer-fallow, and sow it in autumn. But, as the land by fallowing is made open and loose, and as the ploughing and sowing are near the rainy season, cattle ought not to be allowed to pasture upon it during the winter, except in the time of hard frost. Even when sown in the spring, the farmer should not allow much pasturing on it, especially in wet weather. But, if sown by itself, cattle may safely pasture upon it in the winter, as the roots, having nothing to obstruct their progress, penetrate deeper, and spread wider, than when any other grain grows along with it. This practice, however, can only be followed with safety in very clean land; otherwise weeds are apt to rise along with it, and prevent the surface from being covered; which, of course will keep the soil open.\n\nRye-grafts is sometimes sown for hay, and sometimes for pasture. When for hay, from two to four furlots are commonly sown upon an acre.\n\nRye-grafts rises very early in the spring, and, if the soil be dry and warm, affords good pasture all the winter. It is very hardy, stands the frosts, and, if continued in pasture, does not wear out in many years. The best way of managing it is, to eat it down in the spring and beginning of summer, and then to let it rest till autumn. When allowed to get up in summer, it runs to seed, and becomes disagreeable to the cattle. Besides, by this method of managing rye-grafts, a good crop may be expected in autumn.\n\nWhen properly managed, rye-grafts makes very good hay; and there is such a demand for the seed, that the farmer is often tempted to let it stand till the seed is perfected, and then to thresh it. When this is done, the hay can never be good; because the sap is exhausted, the stalk becomes dry and withered, and affords little nourishment to cattle. The hay ought therefore to be always cut before the seed ripens. This practice not only makes the best hay, but is likewise of great advantage to the land; for, when plants are allowed to perfect their seeds, the land is much more exhausted, than when they are cut before that period.\n\nOf the Culture of Clover.\n\nThough clover be used for the same purposes as rye-grafts, it is, however, a plant of a very different nature. It has a large tap-root, which penetrates the soil perpendicularly downward, and opens the earth and makes it free: The roots of clover cannot penetrate the soil, unless it be free and open. Hence, a dry, open, deep soil, free from quickening-grafts, is the most proper for this plant.\n\nThere are several kinds of clover cultivated in Scotland,\nland, distinguished by the colour of their flowers, viz., the red, the white, and the yellow. The red is the largest plant, has the strongest stalk, and broadest leaves. The yellow sometimes grows tall, but the stalk is small. The white is the smallest plant, and is sometimes called hop-clover, from the resemblance its flowers bears to those of the hop.\n\nBoth the seasons and methods of sowing clover are various. Most of the English writers recommend the autumn. It has frequently been tried, at this season, in Scotland without success. When sown in spring, it answers much better in this country.\n\nThe common way of sowing clover, both in Scotland and England, is along with wheat, oats, or barley, in the spring. This method is sometimes attended with disadvantages. The clover sometimes hurts the corn, and the corn the clover. However, these disadvantages are probably more than over-balanced by the corn's protecting the clover from drought when very young, which it is much exposed to, especially when sown in the spring.\n\nAs the lodging of corn destroys all plants that are below; to prevent this, the corn sown along with clover ought to be sown thin, and the land made very clean of weeds.\n\nSometimes, in a wet season, the clover gets a-top of the corn, and destroys the crop. This seldom happens when it is sown with barley or wheat; because it is much later in the season when sown with barley than when sown with oats, and therefore is not so far advanced at harvest; and the wheat is advanced so far before the clover-feed is sown, that the clover can never get the better of it. To prevent the clover, then, from hurting the corn, it may be sown early in the season with wheat, or late in the season with barley. The Thanet barley, from the strength of its roots and stalk, is not so apt to lodge as the common barley; and, of course, it is the most proper kind to be sown along with clover. But, as all kinds of barley are more apt to lodge than oats, and as the season for sowing oats is more proper for sowing clover than the season for sowing barley, the farmer, when it is equally convenient for him, should prefer the sowing of clover with oats.\n\nWhen clover is sown with barley or oats, after these grains are sown, and the land harrowed, the clover-feed is thin sown, and then the land is again harrowed or rolled. When the clover is sown with a crop of wheat, the clover is sown in the spring, and afterwards the wheat is rolled. It is common to sow clover-feed without any preparation given to the land; but it is better to harrow it before sowing. The harrowing does no harm to the wheat, and it makes the roller cover the seed more effectually. Clover-feed may be sown in the same manner amongst oats or early-sown barley. Some time after the corn has come up, the land may be harrowed, and the clover sown. If the weather be dry, the different parts of the operation should succeed one another as quickly as possible. The harrows should be immediately followed by the power, and the power by the roller, to prevent the drought from penetrating too deep.\n\nThe English writers differ widely as to the quantity of clover-feed proper to be sown on an acre. However, the farmers in Scotland, who sow clover with oats or barley, find, that from 10 to 16 lb. of red, or from 12 to 18 lb. of white clover on the acre, produces a very good crop.\n\nClover, like rye-grass, is sometimes sown for hay, sometimes for pasture, and sometimes for both. The red clover is the most proper for hay, the white for pasture; and, when both are intended, a mixture of the two answers best. When red clover is sown without being mixed with any other kind, the farmer ought to bring his land into tillage again in two or three years: For, after the second year, a crop of this kind of clover is of little value.\n\nWhen white clover is sown by itself, the farmer must not expect a crop of hay; for it seldom rises to such a height as to produce a good crop: But, to balance this, the field may be kept long in pasture, as this clover continues till wore out by the natural grass of the soil.\n\nWhen a mixture of the two are sown, some crops of hay may be taken, and then the land may be allowed to lie some years longer for pasture. The red clover affords the crops of hay; and the white remains till the natural grass rises. In this case, there is commonly sown upon the acre, from 8 to 12 lb. of red clover, and from 6 to 8 of white. But these proportions may be varied according to the judgment of the farmer.\n\nIn Scotland, seldom more than one crop of hay in the season succeeds. The second crop is commonly so late, that it is very difficult to get the hay properly made. It may therefore be pastured on, or cut green for cattle. When clover is cut green for cattle, it is a proper way to feed them upon a field that needs dung. This method is preferable to feeding them in stalls; it saves the expense of carrying out the dung, and procures to the land the benefit of the urine, which is a very rich manure.\n\nBefore concluding this article, it must be observed, that red clover, while green, is dangerous to black cattle and sheep, when first given them, especially if wet with dew or rain. They ought therefore to be allowed it only sparingly at first, and brought to it by degrees. After being accustomed to it for a few days, the danger is over, and they may be allowed to use as much of it as they please.\n\nOf the Culture of Clover mixed with Rye-grass.\n\nRed clover makes the best green forage for cattle. An acre of it will maintain more cattle than three or four acres of common grass: But then it is not so proper for hay. Clover-hay is very troublesome in making, and is not reckoned so good for feeding as some other kinds of hay. It likewise hurts the land, by encouraging the growth of quickening-grass. To remedy these disadvantages, it is common to sow rye-grass along with it. Clover, when mixed with rye-grass, is easier made into hay; the hay itself is much better; and the rye-grass, by covering the surface, prevents the growth of the quickening-grass. The quantity sown upon the acre in this way is from 8 to 12 lb. of clover, and from 1 to 3 firlots of rye-grass.\nOf the Culture of St-foin.\n\nThe writers on agriculture reckon this grass preferable to clover in many respects: They say, that it produces a larger crop; that it does not hurt cattle when eaten green; that it makes better hay; that it continues four times longer in the ground; and that it will grow on land that will bear no other crop. These are great advantages: But, as we have so little of that kind of grass in Scotland, it cannot be expected that any directions can be given concerning the manner of cultivating it, founded upon experience. We must therefore confine ourselves to such facts as are mentioned by authors of the best credit.\n\nSt-foin has a very long tap-root, which is able to pierce very hard earth. The roots grow very large, and the larger they are, they penetrate to the greater depth; and hence it may be concluded, that this grass, when it thrives well, receives a great part of its nourishment from below the staple of the soil: of course, a deep dry soil is best for the culture of St-foin. When plants draw their nourishment from that part of the soil that is near the surface, it is not of much consequence whether their number be great or small. But the case is very different when the plants receive their food, not only near, but also deep below the surface. Besides, plants that shoot their roots deep are often supplied with moisture, when those near the surface are parched with drought.\n\nTo render the plants of St-foin vigorous, it is necessary that they be sown thin. The best method of doing this is by a drill; because, when sown in this manner, not only the weeds, but also the supernumerary plants, can easily be removed. It is several years before St-foin comes to its full strength; and the number of plants sufficient to stock a field, while in this imperfect state, will make but a poor crop for the first year or two. It is therefore necessary that it be sown in such a manner as to make it easy to take up plants in such numbers, and in such order, as always to leave in the field the proper number in their proper places. This can only be done with propriety, by sowing the plants in rows by a drill. Supposing a field to be drilled in rows at ten inches distance, the partitions may be hand-hoed, and the rows dressed in such a manner as to leave a proper number of plants. In this situation the field may remain two years; then one fourth of the rows may be taken out in pairs, in such a manner as to make the beds of fifty inches, with six rows in each, and intervals of thirty inches, which may be ploughed. Next year, another fourth of the rows may be taken out in the same manner, so as to leave double rows with partitions of ten inches, and intervals of thirty: All of which may be hoed at once or alternately, as it may be found most convenient.\n\nThe great quantity of this grass which the writers on this subject assure us may be raised upon an acre, and the excellency and great value of the hay made of it, should induce farmers to make a complete trial of it, and even to use the spade in place of the hoe, or hoe-plough, if necessary.\n\nThe plants taken up from a field of St-foin may be set in another field; and if the transplanting of this grass succeeds as well as the transplanting of lucern has done with Mr Lunin de Chateauvieux, the trouble and expense will be sufficiently recompensed by the largeness of the crops. In transplanting, it is necessary to cut off great part of the long tap-root: this will prevent it from striking very deep into the soil, and make it push out large roots in a sloping direction from the cut end of the tap-root. St-foin managed in this manner, will thrive even on shallow land that has a wet bottom, provided it be not overstocked with plants.\n\nWhoever inclines to try the culture of this grass in Scotland, should take great pains in preparing the land, and making it as free from weeds as possible.\n\nOf the Culture of Lucern.\n\nThe writers on agriculture, ancient as well as modern, bestow the highest encomiums upon this grass, as affording excellent hay, and producing very large crops. Lucern remains at least ten or twelve years in the ground, and produces about eight tons of hay upon the Scots acre. There is but little of it cultivated in Scotland. However, it has been tried in several parts of this country; and it is found, that, when the seed is good, it comes up very well, and stands the winter-frost. But the chief thing that prevented this grass from being more used in this country, is the difficulty of keeping the soil open, and free from weeds. In a few years the surface becomes too hard, and the turf too strong, that it destroys the lucern before the plants have arrived at their greatest perfection: so that we cannot hope to cultivate lucern with success, unless we fall upon some method of destroying the natural grass, and prevent the surface from becoming hard and impenetrable. This cannot be done effectually by any other means than horse-hoeing. This method was first proposed by Mr Tull, and afterwards practised successfully by M. de Chateauvieux near Geneva. It may be of use therefore to give a view of that gentleman's method of cultivating lucern.\n\nHe does not mention anything particular as to the manner of preparing the land; but only observes in general, that no pains should be spared in preparing it. He tried the sowing of lucern both in rows upon the beds where it was intended to stand, and likewise the sowing it in a nursery, and afterwards transplanting it into the beds prepared for it. He prefers transplanting; because, when transplanted, part of the tap-root is cut off, and the plant shoots out a number of lateral branches from the cut part of the root, which makes it spread its roots nearer the surface, and consequently renders it more easily cultivated: besides, this circumstance adapts it to a shallow soil, in which, if left in its natural state, it would not grow.\n\nThe transplanting of lucern is attended with many advantages. The land may be prepared in the summer for receiving the plants from the nursery in autumn; by which means the field must be in a much better situation than if the seed had been sown upon it in the spring. By transplanting, the rows can be made more regular, and the intended distances more exactly observed; and consequently\nquently the hoeing can be performed more perfectly, and with less expense. M. Chateauneuf likewise tried the lucern in single beds three feet wide, with single rows; in beds three feet nine inches wide, with double rows; and in beds four feet three inches wide, with triple rows. The plants in the single rows were six inches asunder, and those in the double and triple rows were about eight or nine inches. In a course of three years he found, that a single row produced more than a triple row of the same length. The plants of lucern, when cultivated by transplantation, should be at least six inches asunder, to allow them room for extending their crowns.\n\nHe further observes, that the beds or ridges ought to be raised in the middle; that a small trench, two or three inches deep, should be drawn in the middle; and that the plants ought to be set in this trench, covered with earth up to the neck. He says, that if the lucern be sown in spring, and in a warm soil, it will be ready for transplanting in September; that, if the weather be too hot and dry, the transplanting should be delayed till October; and that, if the weather be unfavourable during both these months, this operation must be delayed till spring. He further directs, that the plants should be carefully taken out of the nursery, so as not to damage the roots; that the roots be left only about six or seven inches long; that the green tops be cut off within about two inches of the crown; that they be put into water as soon as taken up, there to remain till they are planted; and that they should be planted with a planting-stick, in the same manner as cabbages.\n\nHe does not give particular directions as to the times of horse-hoeing; but only says in general, that the intervals should be stirred once in the month during the whole time that the lucern is in a growing state. He likewise observes, that great care ought to be taken not to suffer any weeds to grow among the plants, at least for the first two or three years; and for this purpose, that the rows, as well as the edges of the intervals where the plough cannot go, should be weeded by the hand.\n\nOf the Culture of Potatoes.\n\nThe potatoe is one of the most useful roots that are cultivated in this country, and is raised in a very different manner from any of the other roots. It has a number of eyes in it, each of which produce a separate plant. The largest potatoes are the best for feed; because, when cut according to the eyes, and properly sown, the plants are not in danger of crowding each other. The plant sends out roots in every direction to a considerable distance, and upon these the potatoes are formed.\n\nThere are several kinds both of the white and red potatoes. They succeed best in a light dry soil; and though there be but a small mixture of loam in it, if tolerably rich and properly cultivated, it seldom fails to produce a good crop. But a good crop is not to be expected from a stiff wet soil, unless it be laid up in ridges so as to make it dry, and a considerable quantity of dung laid on to render it open.\n\nWhen the crop of potatoes is the chief point in view, the land should have a ploughing before winter, especially if the soil be not very free and open. If dung be necessary, the proper time for laying it on is before this ploughing. When the potatoes are to be planted, which may be done any time in March or beginning of April, the land must again be ploughed in narrow furrows, and the potatoes dropped into every second furrow. But if the land be open and very loose, they may be dropped into every furrow; and as the plough opens the furrow for the second row, it buries the first row at a proper depth. The furrow should not be very deep; and two horses are sufficient. It is better in this case to make the horses go abreast than in a line; because, as one of them only goes in the furrow, the potatoes are not so liable to be hurt or displaced. This method of planting them by the plough is greatly preferable to the dibble or planting-stick.\n\nWhen a small quantity is intended to be cultivated, they may be planted with the spade. A small cross-trench or furrow should be opened with the spade at the end of the ridge. Into this furrow drop the potatoes at proper distances; and, in making the next furrow, the roots laid in the first will be covered in the same manner as is done by the plough.\n\nAccording to the distance of the rows made by the plough, the distance of the plants in the rows should be regulated: One plant in a square foot is sufficient to allow them to be properly heed. When planted in every second furrow ploughed narrow, the rows will be about 12 or 14 inches asunder. The plants may be placed at the same distance in the rows.\n\nIt is unnecessary to harrow the land after the potatoes are planted: This operation may be delayed till the weeds appear, which gives the farmer an opportunity of destroying them without any additional labour. Tho' potatoes be planted early in the spring, or even before winter, they do not come up till May. Before that time the weeds are far advanced; and, if they be not destroyed by the harrows, the land must be hoed. Indeed, the goodness of the crop depends so much upon preventing the weeds from coming to any height, that it is necessary to hoe potatoes frequently. If the rows be wide, a kind of breast-hoe may be used to throw the earth a little on each side, by which it will be raised about the plants.\n\nWhen two or three plants are in one piece, as often happens in light land, they should be cleaned with the hand at the root, and only one stalk left to each plant. This not only gives air to the roots, but also prevents much of the nourishment from going into the stalks.\n\nWhen the husk that contains the feed, or the apple, as it is commonly called, is completely formed, the stalks may be cut down and given to cows. Milk-cows have been tried with this food; they eat it very freely, and it gives no bad flavour to the milk.\n\nThe time of taking up potatoes is commonly regulated by the market. But, if nothing be in view but the largeness of the crop, they ought to stand till October, or as long as they can be conveniently taken up before the frost sets in. The most expeditious method of taking them up is by the plough: Eight or nine persons to attend\nattend the plough are sufficient. After the field is once ploughed, it ought to be harrowed, by which some of the potatoes will be raised; and, when these are gathered, it should be ploughed a second time.\n\nOf the Culture of Turnips:\n\nTurnips have been long cultivated in England, and, in some places, are esteemed one of the most valuable crops that can be raised. The trials made in Scotland have been very successful, which gives great encouragement to proceed.\n\nThe goodness of the crop depends more on the openness of the soil than its richness. Land newly broken up is particularly proper for turnips. Though this kind of land be naturally poor, yet, with the assistance of a little dung, it seldom fails to produce an excellent crop. The land intended for turnips should be ploughed and laid up in ridges before winter, that it may have the benefit of the frost. This winter-ploughing, however, is unnecessary when the land is dry and light: The spring is early enough for this kind of land. It may get a second ploughing in the end of May, and a third in the middle or end of June, when the seed is to be sown. Though three ploughings are here mentioned, no particular number is intended; for the land ought to be ploughed over and over, till it be thoroughly pulverized. If dung be used, it should be well rotted, and laid on before the last ploughing.\n\nTurnip-feed is usually sown by the hand; and about half a pound is sufficient for an acre. It should be mixed with sand, that it may be scattered the more equally. But sowing by a drill is better than sowing by the hand, as, in this way, the plants can be more easily hoed, and thinned. Turnips should be hoed as soon as the plants can be easily distinguished; for they grow quickly, and, if they meet with any obstruction from weeds, they are apt to become sickly; and, when this happens, they can never be recovered so as to produce a good crop.\n\nTurnips may be cultivated with great success by the new husbandry. They have been tried in single, double, and triple rows, and, in alleys, from four to six feet wide, according to the situation of the land. The poorer the land is, or the more difficult to be reduced, the alleys ought to be the wider. After the ridges are formed, the turnip should be drilled upon the crowns; and, as soon as they come up, and are past all danger from the fly, they should be horse-hoed.\n\nThe turnip is proper food, either for sheep or black cattle. When the land is dry and needs manure, the sheep may be folded on it: But the fold must be removed every day; for it is improper to allow them to eat more at once than they can consume in that time. When the land is wet, or very rich, the turnip may be pulled, and the sheep fed with them on another field that needs manure. But, when designed for black cattle, they must be pulled up and given them, either in stalls or in another field, as the farmer shall find most convenient.\n\nOf the Culture of Carrot:\n\nThe carrot is but rarely cultivated in our fields: Indeed, the present market does not encourage the cultivation of this plant. But they have lately been found to be excellent food for horses; they eat them greedily, and are well fed by them. Carrots are not difficult to raise; a very small field is sufficient, and the trial may easily be made by any farmer, at a very small expense.\n\nThe best crops of carrots, in our gardens, are produced by trenching. When the soil is hard below, though it be well dugged, it does not produce a good crop. Whenever the roots reach the hard soil, they become forked, i.e., the roots divide, which prevents them from growing large. Trenching makes the earth deep, and, by throwing what was on the surface into the bottom of the trench, lays good soil below for the roots to extend themselves into. Something like this must be done in our fields before we can expect a good crop.\n\nM. de Chateauvieux tried to raise a crop of carrots by the horse-hoeing husbandry, and was very successful. He sowed them in beds six feet broad, on the 4th of May. He stirred the alleys with the spade on the 15th and 27th of July, and a third time on the 6th of September. They were dugged up on the 8th of November, measured from 18 to 25 inches in length, and from two to four in diameter, and weighed from 25 to 33 ounces.\n\nLand that has a hard bottom of clay or till is improper; and it is vain to expect that such land can be prepared for carrots by the plough, without great trouble and expense. But, when land has a soft bottom, a good crop of carrots may be raised at a small expense by horse-hoeing.\n\nAs the seed, in this country, must be sown in March, the land should get a ploughing before winter, and be laid out in beds or ridges of the breadth proposed when the carrots are to be sown; the furrows between these ridges should be made as deep as possible, because it is upon these furrows that the rows of carrots are to be sown. A second ploughing in winter should reverse the first, and turn the furrows into crowns; and, before the carrots are sown, one bout of the plough may raise the crown of the ridge still higher. Upon these crowns the seed must be sown out of the hand, into a small trench, drawn as straight as possible, and covered with a rake.\n\nWhen the weeds first appear, the remaining part of the ridges may be ploughed out, turning the earth to the rows, and taking care not to go so near as to cover the plants. Before the seed is sown, which is some time in March, instead of ploughing the whole ridge, the plough should only go once about on the crown, to prevent the bad effects of too much moisture.\n\nAs soon as the plants can be easily distinguished, they should be hand-hoed, and thinned where they stand too thick; and after this the alleys must be regularly hoed, as directed in the culture of turnips.\n\nIt is natural to expect, that carrots raised in this way should be freer from worms, and much better every way,\nway, than those raised in our gardens, except such as are sown upon newly trenched ground.\n\n**Sect. VI. Principles and Advantages of the New Husbandry.**\n\nThe general principles of the new husbandry may be reduced to two, viz., the promoting the growth of plants by hoeing, and the saving of seed; both of which are equally profitable to the farmer.\n\nBut, before illustrating these principles and advantages, it will be necessary to describe the instruments that are commonly used in cultivating land by this new method.\n\nPlate IX. fig. 1. is a marking plough. The principal use of this plough is to straighten and regulate the ridges. The first line is traced by the eye, by means of three poles, placed in a straight line. The plough draws the first furrow in the direction of this line; and, at the same time, with the tooth A, fixed in the block of wood near the end of the cross-poll or slider B B, marks the breadth of the ridge at the distance intended. The ploughman next traces the second line or rut made by the tooth, and draws a small furrow along it; and continues in this manner till the whole field is laid out in straight and equidistant ridges.\n\n\u2014Fig. 2. is a plough for breaking up lea, or turning up the bottom of land when greatly exhausted. By its construction, the width and depth of the furrows can be regulated to a greater certainty than by any other hitherto known in this country. Its appearance is heavy; but two horses are sufficient to plough with it in ordinary free land; and only four are necessary in the stiffest clay-lands. This plough is likewise easily held and tempered. A, is the sword fixed in the sizers B, which runs through a mortise at the end of the beam E, and regulates the depth of the furrow, by raising or depressing the beam; it is fixed by putting the pin D, through the beam and sword, and is moveable at E.\n\n\u2014Fig. 3. is a jointed break harrow with 24 teeth shaped like coulters, and standing at about an angle of 80 degrees. By this instrument the land is finely pulverised, and prepared for receiving the seed from the drill. It requires four horses in stiff, and two in open land. This harrow is likewise used for levelling the ridges; this is done by pressing it down by the handles where the ridge is high, and raising it up when low.\n\n\u2014Fig. 4. is an angular weeding harrow, which may follow the break when necessary. The seven hindmost teeth should stand at a more acute angle than the rest, in order to collect the weeds, which the holder can drop at pleasure, by raising the hinder part, which is fixed to the body of the harrow by two joints.\n\n\u2014Fig. 5. is a pair of harrows with shafts. This harrow is used for covering the seed in the drills, the horse going in the furrow.\n\n\u2014Fig. 6. is a drill-plough, constructed in such a manner as to sow at once two rows of beans, peas, or wheat. This machine is easily wrought by two horses. A, is the happer for containing the seed; B, circular boxes for receiving the seed from the happer; C C, two square boxes which receive the seed from small holes in the circular boxes, as they turn round; and last of all, the seed is dropped into the drills through holes in the square boxes, behind the coulters D. The cylinder E follows, which, together with the wheel F, regulates the depth of the coulters, and covers the feed; the harrow G comes behind all, and covers the seed more completely.

A A the mold-boards, which may be raised or depressed at pleasure, according as the farmer wants to throw the earth higher or lower upon the roots.\n\n**Advantages of Horse-hoeing.**\n\nThe advantages of tillage before sowing have already been pointed out. In this place we must confine ourselves to the utility of tillage after sowing. This kind of tillage is most generally known by the name of horse-hoeing.\n\nLand sowed with wheat, however well it may be cultivated in autumn, sinks in the winter; the particles get nearer together, and the weeds rise; so that in spring, the land is nearly in the same situation as if it never had been ploughed. This, however, is the season when it should branch and grow with most vigour; and consequently stands most in need of ploughing or hoeing, to destroy the weeds, to supply the roots with fresh earth, and, by dividing anew the particles of the soil, to allow the roots to extend and collect nourishment.\n\nIt is well known, that, in gardens, plants grow with double vigour after being hoed or transplanted. If plants growing in arable land could be managed with ease and safety in this manner, it is natural to expect, that their growth would be promoted accordingly. Experience shows, that this is not only practicable, but attended with many advantages.\n\nIn the operation of hoeing wheat, though some of the roots be moved or broke, the plants receive no injury; for this very circumstance makes them send forth a greater number of roots than formerly, which enlarge their pasture, and consequently augment their growth.\n\nSickly wheat has often recovered its vigour after a good hoeing, especially when performed in weather not very hot or dry.\n\nWheat, and such grain as is sown before winter, requires hoeing more than oats, barley, or other grain sown in the spring; for, if the land has been well ploughed before the sowing of spring-corn, it neither has time to harden nor to produce many weeds, not having been exposed to the winter's snow and rain.\nOf Sowing.\n\nAs, in the practice of the new husbandry, plants grow with greater vigour than by the old method, the land should be sowed thinner. It is this principle of the new husbandry that has been chiefly objected to; for, upon observing the land occupied by a small number of plants, people are apt to look upon all the vacant space as lost. But this prejudice will soon be removed, when it is considered, that, in the best land cultivated in the common method, and sown very thick, each seed produces but one or two ears; that, in the same land sown thinner, every seed produces two or three ears; and that a single seed sometimes produces eighteen or twenty ears.\n\nIn the common method, as there are many more plants than can find sufficient nourishment, and as it is impossible to assist them by hoeing, numbers die before they attain maturity, the greatest part remain sickly and drooping; and thus part of the seed is lost. On the contrary, in the new method, all the plants have as much food as they require; and as they are, from time to time, assisted by hoeing, they become so vigorous as to equal in their production the numerous, but sickly plants cultivated in the common method.\n\nOf Hoeing.\n\nThe new husbandry is absolutely impracticable in lands that are not easily ploughed. Attempting to cultivate land according to this husbandry, without attending to this circumstance, that it is practicable in no land, excepting such as have already been brought into good tilth by the old method, has gone far to make it contemptible in many places.\n\nWhen a field is in good tilth, it should be sowed so thin as to leave sufficient room for the plants to extend their roots. After being well ploughed and harrowed, it must be divided into rows, at the distance of 30 inches from one another. On the sides of each of these rows, two rows of wheat must be sowed six inches distant from each other. By this means there will be an interval of two feet wide betwixt the rows, and every plant will have room enough to extend its roots, and to supply it with food. The intervals will likewise be sufficient for allowing the earth to be hoed or tilled without injuring the plants in the rows.\n\nThe first hoeing, which should be given before the winter, is intended to drain away the wet, and to dispose the earth to be mellowed by the frosts. These two ends will be answered by drawing two small furrows at a little distance from the rows, and throwing the earth taken from the furrows into the middle of the intervals. This first hoeing should be given when the wheat is in leaf.\n\nThe second hoeing, which is intended to make the plants branch, should be given after the hard frosts are over. To do this with advantage, after stirring the earth a little, near the rows, the earth which was thrown in the middle of the intervals should be turned back into the furrows. This earth, having been mellowed by the\n\nwinter, supplies the plants with excellent food; and makes the roots extend.\n\nThe third hoeing, which is intended to invigorate the stalk, should be given when the ears of the corn begin to show themselves. This hoeing may, however, be very slight.\n\nBut the last hoeing is of the greatest importance, as it enlarges the grain, and makes the ears fill at their extremities. This hoeing should be given when the wheat is in bloom; a furrow must be drawn in the middle of the interval, and the earth thrown to the right and left on the foot of the plants. This supports the plants, prevents them from being laid, and prepares the ground for the next sowing, as the seed is then to be put in the middle of the ground that formed the intervals.\n\nBy this successive tillage, or hoeing, good crops will be obtained, provided the weather is not very unfavourable.\n\nBut as strong, vigorous plants are longer before they arrive at maturity, corn raised in the new way is later in ripening than any other, and must therefore be sown earlier.\n\nIn order to prepare the intervals for sowing again, some well-rotted dung may be laid in the deep furrows made in the middle of the intervals; and this dung must be covered with the earth that was before thrown towards the rows of wheat. But, if the land does not require mending, the deep furrow is filled without any dung. This operation should be performed immediately after harvest, that there may be time to give the land a slight stirring before the rows are sowed; which should occupy the middle of the space which formed the intervals during the last crop. The intervals of the second year take up the space occupied by the stubble of the first.\n\nSupposing dung to be necessary, which is denied by many, a very small quantity is sufficient; a single layer, put in the bottom of each furrow, will be enough.\n\nSummary of the Operations necessary in executing the New Husbandry with the Plough.\n\n1. It is indispensibly necessary that the farmer be provided with a drill and hoe-plough.\n2. The new husbandry may be begun either with the winter or spring corn.\n3. The land must be prepared by four good ploughings, given at different times, from the beginning of April to the middle of September.\n4. These ploughings must be done in dry weather, to prevent the earth from kneading.\n5. The land must be harrowed in the same manner as if it were sowed in the common way.\n6. The rows of wheat should be sowed very straight.\n7. When the field is not very large, a line must be strained across it, by which a rill may be traced with a hoe for the horse that draws the drill to go in; and, when the rows are sown, fifty inches must be left betwixt each rill. But, when the field is large, stakes at five feet distance from each other, must be placed at the two ends. The workman must then trace a small furrow,\nwith a plough that has no mold-board, for the horse to go in that draws the drill, directing himself with his eye by the stakes.\n\n8. The sowing should be finished about the end of September, or beginning of October.\n\n9. The furrows must be traced the long way of the land, that as little ground as possible may be lost in headlands.\n\n10. The rows, if it can be done, should run down the slope of the land, that the water may get the easier off.\n\n11. The seed-wheat must be plunged into a tub of lime-water, and stirred, that the light corn may come to the surface and be skimmed off.\n\n12. The seed must next be spread on a floor, and frequently stirred, till it is dry enough to run through the valves of the hopper of the drill.\n\n13. To prevent smut, the seed may be put into a lye of ashes and lime.\n\n14. After the hoppers of the drill are filled, the horse must go slowly along the furrow that was traced. That a proper quantity of seed may be sown, the aperture of the hopper must be suited to the size of the grain.\n\n15. As the drill is seldom well managed at first, the field should be examined after the corn has come up, and the deficiencies supplied.\n\n16. Stiff lands that retain the wet, must be stirred or hoed in October. This should be done by opening a furrow in the middle of the intervals, and afterwards filling it up by a furrow drawn on each side, which will raise the earth in the middle of the intervals, and leave two small furrows next the rows, for draining off the water, which is very hurtful to wheat in winter.\n\n17. The next stirring must be given about the end of March, with a light plough. In this stirring, the furrows made to drain the rows must be filled up by earth from the middle of the intervals.\n\n18. Some time in May, the rows must be evened, which, though troublesome at first, soon becomes easy, as the weeds are soon kept under by tillage.\n\n19. In June, just before the wheat is in bloom, another stirring must be given with the plough. A deep furrow must be made in the middle of the intervals, and the earth thrown upon the sides of the rows.\n\n20. When the wheat is ripe, particular care must be taken in reaping it, to trample as little as possible on the ploughed land.\n\n21. Soon after the wheat is carried off the field, the intervals must be turned up with the plough, to prepare them for the seed. The great furrow in the middle must not only be filled, but the earth raised as much as possible in the middle of the intervals.\n\n22. In September, the land must be again sowed with a drill, as above directed.\n\n23. In October, the stubble must be turned in for forming the new intervals; and the same management must be observed as directed in the first year.\n\nWe pretend not to determine whether the old or new husbandry be preferable in every country.\n\nWith regard to this point, the climate, the situation of particular land, skill and dexterity in managing the machinery, the comparative expense in raising crops, and many other circumstances, must be accurately attended to before a determination can be given. One observation, however, may be made in favour of the new husbandry:\u2014Though the particular modes of cultivating land by it are perhaps too limited to be universally adopted; yet it has been of great use in raising suspicions concerning the old method, and in turning the views of philosophers and farmers towards improving in general. Many real improvements in agriculture have been the consequences of these suspicions; and as this spirit of inquiry remains in full vigour, particularly in our own country, a solid foundation is laid for expecting still further improvements in this useful art.","sp":72,"ep":100},{"h":"PART II","t":"OF THE MUSCLES.\n\nSect. I. Of the Muscles in general.\n\nTHE muscles are bundles of fibres of different figures and sizes, and for the most part consisting of two different portions; one whereof is thick, soft, and more or less red, forming what is called the body, fleshy substance, or belly of the muscle. The other is thin and small, of a close texture, and very white, forming the extremities, termed by anatomists tendons or aponeuroses. Both portions are covered by a particular membrane.\n\nThe fibres are, for the most part, ranked in fasciculi, in a lateral situation with respect to each other, and distinguished by membranous, cellular, or adipose septa, as by so many particular vaginae.\n\nThese fibres are connected to each other, and to the intermediate septa, by a great number of very small fine filaments, the capillary extremities of arteries, veins, and nerves running over them; and they are inclosed in a thin membranous, cellular covering, called the proper membrane of the muscle, being a continuation of the septa or vaginae already mentioned.\n\nThe disposition of the fibres is various: some are disposed like radii; others form planes more or less incurved; and some form complete circumferences, the two extremities meeting and uniting together.\n\nThe difference of muscles is very considerable, and depends on many circumstances; the chief of which are, the size, figure, direction, situation, structure, connection, and use; and it is from these differences that the names of the greatest part of the muscles are taken.\nFrom their size they are termed great, middle, small, long, broad, thin; from their figure, triangular, scienous, square, &c. From their direction, fleshy, oblique, transverse. From their situation, superior, inferior, external, &c.\n\nWith respect to their structure, muscles are either simple or compound. Simple muscles are those whose fleshy fibres, or rather the fleshy portions of their moving fibres, are all uniformly disposed, and terminate in tendons lying either in a strait or oblique line.\n\nCompound muscles are those whose fleshy fibres are disposed obliquely in several particular ranks, representing the same number of simple muscles, with their fibres lying in opposite directions. In proportion to the number of these ranks or series, the muscle is said to be more or less compounded.\n\nWhen the compound muscle is made up of two simple muscles only, these are so disposed as to represent a feather, and the compound muscle is from thence termed penniform.\n\nSome are made up of two muscles more or less, in a lateral situation with respect to each other, and united at one extremity; others are made up of three or four muscles, situated in the same manner; and if they are united at that extremity which the ancients called the head of the muscle, they are called bicipites, tricipites, &c.; according to the number of these heads; but if they are joined at the other extremity, they are termed bicorner, tricorner, &c.\n\nThe muscles are fixed by their extremities to different parts, and in different places of the human body. The greatest part of them are inserted in bones alone. Some are fixed partly to bones, and partly to cartilages; as those of the ear and nose: some partly to bones, and partly to the integuments; as several muscles of the face.\n\nThe names taken from the connections and insertions of muscles are generally of two kinds; one common, and referred to some considerable part of the body; as when we say, the muscles of the head, of the thorax, abdomen, &c.; the other proper, specifying more particularly the insertions of each muscle, as the mastoides, sternomastoideus, &c.\n\nThe general use of the muscles is to move all the parts of the body, whether hard, soft, or fluid. Most of the hard and soft parts are moved by these powers being fixed to them, and they move the rest without any such insertion.\n\nThe action of the muscles in general, consists chiefly in the contraction or shortening of their fleshy portion; by which the extremities of the muscle are brought nearer to each other, and consequently the parts are moved to which their extremities are fixed.\n\nThe principal phenomena of muscular action are these: The fleshy portion appears harder and more swollen in the time of action than of inaction, as may be readily perceived by touching it in both states: The hardness of this swelling increases in proportion as the motion is continued, as is likewise evident by the touch; and it likewise increases by merely adding to the weight or resistance of the part moved, though its situation does not continue to be changed.\n\nSect. II. The Muscles of the Abdomen.\n\nBy the muscles of the abdomen, or lower belly, we mean those which form principally the sides or circumference of that cavity. They are commonly ten in number, five on each side; eight whereof are very large, the other two very small.","sp":231,"ep":232},{"h":"PART III","t":"OF THE ARTERIES.\n\nThe heart throws the blood into two great arteries; one of which is named aorta, the other arteria pulmonalis.\n\nThe aorta distributes the blood to all the parts of the body, for the nourishment of the parts, and for the secretion of different fluids.\nThe arteria pulmonalis carries the venal blood through all the capillary vessels of the lungs.\n\nBoth these great or general arteries are subdivided into several branches, and into a great number of ramifications. In this part, we shall describe the distributions of the aorta, leaving the pulmonary artery to the particular history of the lungs. See Part VI.\n\nThe basis of the heart being very much inclined to the right side; and turned a little backward, the aorta goes out from it in a direct course, nearly over-against the fourth vertebra of the back. Its course is direct with respect to the heart; but with respect to all the rest of the body, it ascends obliquely from the left to the right hand, and from before backward.\n\nSoon after this, it bends obliquely from the right hand to the left, and from before backward, reaching as high as the second vertebra of the back; from whence it runs down again in the same direction, forming an oblique arch. The middle of this arch is almost opposite to the right side or edge of the superior portion of the sternum, between the cartilaginous extremities or sternal articulations of the first two ribs.\n\nFrom thence the aorta descends in a direct course along the anterior part of the vertebrae, all the way to the os sacrum, lying a little toward the left hand; and there it terminates in two subordinate or collateral trunks, called arteriae iliacae.\n\nThe aorta is by anatomists generally divided into the aorta ascendens and aorta descendens, though both are but one and the same trunk. It is termed ascendens, from where it leaves the heart to the extremity of the great curvature or arch. The remaining part of this trunk from the arch to the os sacrum or bifurcation, already mentioned, is named descendens.\n\nThe aorta descendens is further divided into the superior and inferior portions; the first taking in all that lies above the diaphragm; the other all that lies between the diaphragm and the bifurcation.\n\nThe aorta ascendens is chiefly distributed to part of the thorax, to the head and upper extremities. The superior portion of the aorta descendens furnishes the rest of the thorax; the inferior portion furnishes the abdomen and lower extremities.\n\nThe great trunk of the aorta, through its whole length, sends off immediately several branches, which are afterwards differently ramified; and these arterial branches may be looked upon as so many trunks with respect to the other ramifications, which again may be considered as small trunks with regard to the ramifications that they send off.\n\nThe branches which go out immediately from the trunk of the aorta, may be termed original or capital branches; and of these some are large and others very small.\n\nThe large capital branches of the aorta are these: two arteriae subclavieae, two carotides, one celiaca, one mesenterica superior, two renales, formerly termed emulgents, one mesenterica inferior, and two iliacae.\n\nThe small capital branches are chiefly the arteriae coronariae cordis, bronchiales, oesophagae, intercostales, diaphragmaticae inferiores, spermaticae, lumbares, and sacrae.\n\nThese capital branches or arteries are for the most part disposed in pairs; there being none in odd numbers but the celiaca, the two mesentericae, some of the oesophagae, the bronchiales, and sometimes the sacrae.\n\nThe aorta gives rise to two small arteries, called coronariae cordis, which go to the heart and its auricles; one of which is situated anteriorly, the other posteriorly, and sometimes they are three in number.\n\nFrom the upper part of the arch or curvature, the aorta sends out commonly three, sometimes four large capital branches, their origins being very near each other. When there are four, the two middle branches are termed arteriae carotides; the other two, subclavieae; and both are distinguished into right and left.\n\nWhen there are but three branches, which is oftener the case, the first is a short trunk, common to the right subclavian and carotid, the second is the left subclavian, and the third the left carotid.\n\nThe origin of the left subclavian terminates the aorta ascendens.\n\nThe carotid arteries run up directly to the head, each of them being first divided into two, one external, the other internal. The external artery goes chiefly to the outer parts of the head and dura mater, or first covering of the brain. The internal enters the cranium, through the bony canal of the os petrosum; and is distributed through the brain by a great number of ramifications.\n\nThe subclavian arteries separate laterally, and almost transversely, each toward that side on which it lies, behind and under the clavicle, from whence they have their name.\n\nThe subclavian on each side terminates at the upper edge of the first rib, between the lower insertions of the first scalenus muscle; and there, as it goes out of the thorax, takes the name of arteria axillaris.\n\nDuring this course of the subclavian artery, several arteries arise from it, viz. the mammae internae, mediafina, pericardia, diaphragmatica minor five superior, thymica and trachealis.\n\nThe thymica and trachealis on each side are, in some subjects, only branches of one small trunk which spring from the common trunk of the right subclavian and carotid.\n\nThey are generally small arteries which run sometimes separate, and sometimes partly separate and partly joined.\n\nThe subclavian sends off likewise the mammae internae, vertebrales, cervicales, and sometimes several of the upper intercostales.\n\nThe axillary artery, which is only a continuation of the subclavian from where it goes out of the thorax to the axilla, detaches chiefly the mammae externae, or thoracica superior, thoracica inferior, scapulares externae, scapulares internae, humeralis or muscularis, &c. Afterwards it is continued by different ramifications, and under different names, over the whole arm, all the way to the ends of the fingers.\n\nThe superior portion of the aorta descendens gives off the arteriae bronchiales, which arise sometimes by a small common trunk, sometimes separate, and sometimes do not come immediately from the aorta. It next sends off the oesophagae, which may be looked upon as mediafinae posteriores;\nThe inferior portion of the descending aorta, as it passes through the diaphragm, gives off the diaphragmaticae inferiores, or phrenic\u00e6; afterwards it sends off several branches, anteriorly, posteriorly, and laterally.\n\nThe anterior branches are the celiaca, which supplies the stomach, liver, spleen, pancreas, &c., the mesenterica superior, which goes chiefly to the mesentery, to the small intestines, and that part of the great intestines which lies on the right side of the abdomen; the mesenterica inferior, which goes to the great intestines on the left side, and produces the hemorrhoidalis interna; and lastly, the right and left arteriae spermatic\u00e6.\n\nThe posterior branches are the arteriae lumbares, of which there are several pairs, and the sacre, which do not always come from the trunk of the aorta.\n\nThe lateral branches are the capulare and adipose, the origin of which often varies; the renales, formerly termed emulgents; and the iliac\u00e6, which terminate the aorta by the bifurcation already mentioned.\n\nThe iliac artery on each side is commonly divided into the external or anterior, and internal or posterior.\n\nThe internal iliac is likewise named arteria hypogastrica; and its ramifications are distributed to the viscera contained in the pelvis, and to the neighbouring parts, both internal and external.\n\nThe iliac externa, which is the true continuation of the iliac trunk, goes on to the inguen, and then out of the abdomen, under the ligamentum Fallopii; having first detached the epigastrica, which goes to the musculi abdominis recti. Having quitted the abdomen, it commences arteria cruralis, which runs down upon the thigh, and is distributed by many branches and ramifications to all the lower extremity.\n\nWe shall now go on to examine particularly all the capital or original branches of the aorta, from their origin, to the entry of them and of their ramifications into all parts of the body.\n\nThe Cardiac or coronary arteries of the heart arise from the aorta immediately on its leaving the heart. They are two in number, and go out near the two sides of the pulmonary artery, which having first surrounded, they afterwards run upon the basis of the heart in form of a kind of crown, or garland, from whence they are called coronarie; and then pursue the superficial traces of the union of the two ventricles, from the basis of the heart to the apex, and are afterwards lost in the substance of the heart.\n\nThe Carotid arteries are two in number, one called the right carotid, the other the left. They arise near each other, from the curvature of the aorta, the left immediately, the right most commonly from the trunk of the subclavia on the same side.\n\nThey run upon each side of the trachea arteria, between it and the internal jugular vein, as high as the larynx, without any ramification. Each of these trunks is afterwards ramified in the following manner.\n\nThe trunk having reached as high as the larynx, is divided into two large branches or particular carotids, one named external, the other internal, because the first goes chiefly to the external parts of the head, the second enters the cranium, and is distributed to the brain.\n\nThe external carotid is anterior, the internal posterior; and the external is even situated more inward, and nearer the larynx, than the other.\n\nThe external carotid is the smallest. It runs insensibly outward, between the external angle of the lower jaw, and the parotid gland, which it supplies as it passes. Afterwards it ascends on the fore-side of the ear, and ends in the temples.\n\nIn this course it sends off several branches, which may well enough be divided into anterior or internal, and posterior or external; and the principal branches of each kind are these:\n\nThe first anterior or internal branch goes out from the very origin of the carotid on the inside; and having presently afterward taken a little turn, and sent off branches to the jugular glands near it, to the fat and skin, it runs transversely, and is distributed to the glandulae thyroide\u00e6, and to the muscles and other parts of the larynx: it likewise sends some branches to the pharynx and muscles of the os hyoides.\n\nThe second anterior branch passes over the nearest cornu of the os hyoides, to the muscles of that bone and the tongue, and to the glandulae sublinguales; afterwards passing before the cornu of the os hyoides, it loses itself in the tongue, from whence it has been called arteria sublingualis.\n\nThe third branch, or arteria maxillaris inferior, goes to the maxillary gland, to the styloid and maffoid muscles, to the parotid and sublingual glands, to the muscles of the pharynx, and to the small flexors of the head.\n\nThe fourth branch, arteria maxillaris externa, passes anteriorly on the masseter muscle, and middle of the lower jaw, near the chin. Afterwards it runs under the muculus triangularis labiorum, which it supplies as well as the buccinator and the quadratus menti.\n\nIt sends of a particular branch, very much contorted, which divides at the angular commissure of the lips, and running in the same manner along the superior and inferior portions of the musculus orbicularis, it communicates on both sides with its fellow, and thereby forms a kind of arteria coronaria labiorum.\n\nAfterwards it ascends towards the nares, and is distributed to the muscles, cartilages, and other parts of the nose, sending down some twigs which communicate with the coronary artery of the lips. Lastly, it reaches the great angle of the eye, and is ramified and lost on the muculus orbicularis palpebrarum, superciliaris, and frontalis. Through all this course, it is named arteria angularis.\n\nThe fifth branch, maxillaris interna, arises over-against the condyle of the lower jaw. It passes behind the condyle, and having given off a twig among the musculi pterygoidei, it is divided into three principal branches.\n\nThe first branch, or spheno-maxillaris, goes through the inferior orbital, or spheno-maxillary fissure, to the orbit, after having supplied the musculi peritrophylins, and\nand the glandulous membranes of the posterior nares, through the foramen spheno-palatinum.\n\nIt is distributed inferiorly and laterally to the parts contained in the orbit, and detaches a small subaltern branch through the extremity of the superior orbital, or sphenoidal fissure, which enters the cranium, and is spent upon the dura mater.\n\nIt sends off likewise another subaltern branch, which passes through the posterior opening of the orbital canal, and having furnished the maxillary sinus and the teeth, goes out by the inferior orbital hole, and on the cheek communicates with the angular artery.\n\nThe second branch runs through the canal of the lower jaw, and being distributed to the alveoli and teeth, goes out at the hole near the chin, and loses itself in the neighbouring muscles.\n\nThe third branch runs up between the internal and external carotids, passes through the foramen spinale of the sphenoidal bone, and is distributed to the dura mater by several ramifications.\n\nThe sixth anterior or internal branch, which is very small, is spent on the musculus masseter.\n\nThe first external or posterior branch is named arteria occipitalis. It passes obliquely before the internal jugular vein, and having twigs to the musculus stylo-hyoideus, stylo-glossus, and digastricus, it runs between the styloid and mastoid apophyses, along the mastoid groove, and goes to the muscles and integuments which cover the os occipitis, turning several times in an undulating manner, as it ascends backwards.\n\nThe second external branch spreads itself on the outward ear, by a great many small twigs on each side, several of which run inward, and furnish the cartilages, meatus auditorius, skin of the tympanum, and internal ear.\n\nThe trunk of the external carotid ascends afterward above the zygoma, passing between the angle of the lower jaw and parotid gland, and forms the temporal artery, which divides into an anterior, middle, and posterior branch.\n\nThe anterior branch of the temporal artery goes to the musculus frontalis, communicates with the arteria angularis, and sometimes gives off a very small artery, which pierces the internal apophysis of the os magnum all the way to the orbit. The middle branch goes partly to the musculus frontalis, partly to the occipitalis. The posterior branch goes to the occiput, and communicates with the arteria occipitalis. All these branches likewise furnish the integuments.\n\nThe internal carotid artery, leaving the general trunk, is at first a little incurved, appearing as if either it were the only branch of that trunk, or a branch of the trunk of the external carotid.\n\nIt is situated a little more backward than the carotis externa, and generally runs up, without any ramification, as high as the lower orifice of the great canal of the apophysis petrota of the os temporis. It enters this orifice directly from below upward.\n\nAt the end of this canal it is again incurved from below upward, and enters the cranium through a notch of the sphenoidal bone. Then it bends from behind forward, and makes a third angle on the side of the sella sphenoidalis; and again a fourth, under the clinoid apophysis of that sella.\n\nAs it leaves the bony canal to enter the cranium, it sends off a branch through the sphenoidal fissure to the orbit and eye, and soon afterwards another through the foramen opticum.\n\nAfterwards the internal carotid runs under the basis of the brain, to the side of the infundibulum, where it is at a small distance from the internal carotid of the other side, and there it commonly divides into two principal branches, one anterior, and one posterior.\n\nThe anterior branch runs forward under the brain, first separating from that on the other side, then coming nearer again, it unites with it by an anastomosis, or communication, in the interstice between the olfactory nerves. Afterwards having sent off some small arteries, which accompany these nerves, it leaves its fellow, and divides into two or three.\n\nThe first of these branches goes to the anterior lobe of the brain; the second, which is sometimes double, is inverted on the corpus callosum, to which it gives some ramifications, as also to the falx of the dura mater, and middle lobe of the brain. The third goes to the posterior lobe of the brain.\n\nThe posterior branch communicates first of all with the vertebral artery of the same side, and then divides into several rami, which run between the superficial circumvolutions of the brain, and are ramified in many different directions on and between these circumvolutions, all the way to the bottom of the fulci.\n\nAll these ramifications are covered by the pia mater, in the duplicature of which they are distributed, and form capillary reticular textures in great numbers; and afterwards are lost in the inner substance of the brain.\n\nThe Subclavian arteries are two in number, one right, the other left; and they arise from the arch of the aorta, on each side of the left carotid, which commonly lies in the middle between them; but when both carotids go out separately, they both lie between the subclavies.\n\nThe right subclavian is larger at the beginning than the left, when it produces the right carotid; its origin is likewise more anterior and higher, because of the obliquity of the arch of the aorta. Both of them are distributed much in the same manner, and therefore the description of one may likewise be applied to the other.\n\nThe right subclavian, the longest of the two, gives off, first of all, small arteries to the mediastinum, thymus, pericardium, aspera arteria, &c., which are named mediastinum, thymica, pericardiae, and tracheae.\n\nAfterward this right subclavian, at about a finger's breadth from its origin, often produces the common carotid of the same side; and at a small finger's breadth from the carotid, it gives off commonly three considerable branches, viz., the mammaea interna, cervicalis, and vertebralis, and sometimes an intercostal artery, which goes to the first ribs, called intercostalis superior.\n\nThe arteria thymica communicates with the mammaea interna, and sometimes arises from the anterior middle part of the common trunk of the subclavian and carotid.\nThe thymus receives likewise some rami from the mammae interna, and intercostalis superior.\n\nThe pericardia arises much in the same manner with the thymica, and runs down upon the pericardium, all the way to the diaphragm, to which it sends some small ramifications.\n\nThe mediastina arises sometimes immediately after the thymica, and is distributed principally to the mediastinum.\n\nThe trachealis, which may likewise be named gutturalis inferior, runs up from the subclavia, in a winding course, along the aspera arteria, to the glandula thyroidea and larynx, detaching small arteries to both sides, one of which runs to the upper part of the scapula.\n\nThe internal mammary artery comes from the anterior and lower side of the subclavia, near the middle of the clavicle, and runs down, for about a finger's breadth, behind the cartilages of the true ribs, an inch distant from the sternum.\n\nIn its passage, it sends rami to the thymus, mediastinum, pericardium, pleura, and intercostal muscles. It likewise detaches other branches through these muscles, and between the cartilages of the ribs, to the pectoralis major, and other neighbouring muscular portions; to the mammae, membrana adiposa, and skin.\n\nAfterwards it goes out at the thorax, on one side of the appendix caudiformis, and is lost in the musculus abdominis rectus, a little below its upper part.\n\nThe cervical artery arises from the upper side of the subclavian, and is presently afterward divided into two, which come out, sometimes separately, sometimes by a small common trunk. The largest of these two arteries is anterior, the other posterior.\n\nThe anterior cervicalis, running behind the carotid of the same side, is distributed to the musculus coraco-hyoideus, mastoideus, cutaneus, sterno-hyoideus, and sternohyoideus; to the jugular glands, the aspera arteria, the muscles of the pharynx, bronchia, oesophagus; and to the anterior muscles which move the neck and head.\n\nThe posterior cervicalis arises sometimes a little after the vertebralis, and sometimes from that artery. It passes under the transverse apophysis of the last vertebra of the neck, and sometimes through a particular hole in that apophysis; and from thence runs up backward in a winding course, on the vertebral muscles of the neck, and then returns in the same manner.\n\nThe vertebral artery goes out from the posterior and upper side of the subclavian, almost opposite to the mammae interna and cervicalis. It runs up through all the holes in the transverse apophyses of the vertebrae of the neck, and, in its passage, sends off little twigs, through the lateral notches of these vertebrae, to the medulla spinalis and its coverings. It also gives arteries to the vertebral muscles, and to other muscles near them.\n\nIt sends off a small branch, which is ramified on the outer and posterior parts of the occiput, and communicates with the cervical and occipital arteries. Having afterwards reached the great foramen of the os occipitis, it enters the cranium, and pierces the dura mater.\n\nAs soon as it enters the cranium, it sends several small ramifications to the back-part of the medulla oblongata, and to the corpora olivaria and pyramidalia, which are likewise spread on the back sides of the fourth ventricle of the brain, and form the plexus choroides of the cerebellum.\n\nAfterwards it advances on the apophysis basilaris of the os occipitis, inclining, by small degrees, toward the vertebral artery of the other side, all the way to the extremity of that apophysis, where they both join in one common trunk.\n\nThe arteria basilaris runs forward under the great transverse protuberance of the medulla oblongata, to which it gives ramifications, as well as to the neighbouring parts of the medulla.\n\nThe spinal arteries are two in number, one anterior, and one posterior; both produced by both vertebrales, each of which, as soon as it enters the cranium, sends out a small branch, by the union of which the posterior spinalis is formed. Afterwards the vertebrales advancing on the apophysis basilaris, or production of the occipital bone, detach backward two other small branches, which likewise meet, and, by their union, form the spinalis anterior. These spinal arteries run down on the fore and back sides of the medulla spinalis, and, by small transverse ramifications, communicate with those which the intercostal and lumbar arteries send to the same part.\n\nThe internal auditory artery goes off from each side of the arteria basilaris, to the organ of hearing, accompanying the auditory nerve, having first furnished several small twigs to the membrana arachnoides.\n\nThe posterior meningea arises from the same trunk with the auditoria interna, and goes to the back-part of the dura mater, on the occipital and temporal bones, and supplies the neighbouring lobes of the brain.\n\nWhen the superior intercostal artery does not go out from the trunk of the aorta descendens, it commonly arises from the lower side of the subclavian, and runs down on the inside of the two, three, or four uppermost true ribs, near their heads, and sends off, under each rib, a branch, which runs along the lower edge, and supplies the intercostal muscles and neighbouring parts of the pleura.\n\nThese branches, or particular intercostal arteries, communicate with each other at different distances by small rami, which run upward and downward from one to the other, on the intercostal muscles.\n\nThe ductus arteriosus, which is found only in the fetus and in very young children, arises from the aorta descendens, immediately below the left subclavian artery. In adults, this duct is shrunk up and closed, and appears only like a short ligament adhering by one end to the aorta, and by the other to the pulmonary artery, so that in reality it deserves no other name than that of ligamentum arteriosum.\n\nThe bronchial arteries go sometimes from the fore-side of the superior descending aorta, sometimes from the first intercostal, and sometimes from the arteria oesophag\u00e6a. Sometimes they arise separately from each side, to go to each lung, and sometimes by a small common trunk, which afterwards separates towards the right and left hand, at the bifurcation of the aspera arteria, and accompany the ramifications of the bronchia.\nThe bronchialis gives a small branch to the neighbouring auricle of the heart, which communicates with the arteria coronaria.\n\nThe oesophageae are generally two or three in number, sometimes but one. They arise anteriorly from the aorta descendens, and are distributed to the oesophagus, &c.\n\nThe inferior intercostals are commonly seven or eight on each side, and sometimes ten, when the superior intercostals arise likewise from the aorta descendens; in which case these run obliquely upward.\n\nThey arise along the back-side of the descending aorta in pairs, all the way to the diaphragm, and run transversely towards each side, on the bodies of the vertebrae. Those on the right side pass behind the vena azygos; and afterwards they all run to the intercostal muscles, along the lower edge of the ribs, all the way to the sternum, or near it.\n\nThey send branches to the pleura, to the vertebral muscles, to those muscles which lie on the outsides of the ribs, and to the upper portions of the muscles of the abdomen; and they communicate with the arteria epigastrica and lumbares.\n\nBefore they take their course along the ribs, each of them detaches one branch between the transverse apophyses on both sides, to the vertebral muscles, and another which enters the great canal of the spina dorsi.\n\nAfterwards each intercostal artery having reached the middle of the rib, or a little more, divides into two principal branches, one internal, the other external. Soon after this division, the arteries that run upon the false ribs, separate a little from them, being gradually bent downward one after another, and are spread upon the abdominal muscles.\n\nThe subclavian artery having left the thorax immediately above the first rib, in the interspace left between the portions of the scalenus, there receives the name of axillaris, because it passes under the axilla.\n\nIn this course it gives off, from its inside, a small branch to the inside of the first rib; and afterwards four or five principal branches, viz. the thoracica superior, or mammaria externa, thoracica inferior, muscularis, or scapularis externa, scapularis interna, and humeralis.\n\nThe superior thoracica, or external mammary artery, runs down, in a winding course, on the lateral parts of the thorax, and crosses the ribs. It gives branches to the two pectoral muscles, to the mamma, musculus subclavius, serratus major, latissimus dorsi, and to the upper portions of the coraco-brachialis and biceps.\n\nThe inferior thoracic artery runs along the inferior costae of the scapula, to the musculus subscapularis, teres major and minor, infra-spinatus, latissimus dorsi, serratus major, and the neighbouring intercostal muscles, communicating with the arteriae scapulares.\n\nThe external scapular artery passes through the notch in the superior costae of the scapula, to the musculus supra-spinatus and infra-spinatus, teres major and minor, and to the articulation of the scapula with the os humeri.\n\nThe internal scapularis arises from the axillary artery near the axilla, and runs backward, to be distributed to the subscapularis, giving branches to the serratus major, to the axillary glands, and to the teres major.\n\nThe humeral artery arises from the lower and fore-side of the axillaris, and runs backward between the head of the os humeri and teres major, surrounding the articulation, till it reaches the posterior part of the deltoides, to which it is distributed.\n\nDuring this course, it gives several branches to the superior portions of the anconei, to the capsular ligament of the joint of the shoulder, and to the os humeri itself, through several holes immediately below the great tuberosity of the head of that bone.\n\nOpposite to the origin of this humeral artery, the axillaris sends off another small branch, which runs in a contrary direction, between the head of the os humeri, and the common upper part of the biceps and coraco-brachialis; and having given branches to the vagina and channel of the biceps, and to the periosteum, afterwards joins the principal humeralis.\n\nThe axillary artery having given off these branches, passes immediately behind the tendon of the pectoralis major, where it changes its former name for that of arteria brachialis. It runs down on the inside of the arm, over the musculus coraco-brachialis and anconeus internus, and along the inner edge of the biceps, behind the vena basilica, giving small branches on both sides to the neighbouring muscles, to the periosteum, and to the bone.\n\nBetween the axilla and middle of the arm, it is covered only by the skin and fat; but afterwards it is hid under the biceps, and runs obliquely forward as it descends; being at some distance from the internal condyle, but it does not reach the middle of the fold of the arm.\n\nBetween the axilla and this place, it sends off many branches to the infra-spinatus, teres major and minor, subscapularis, latissimus dorsi, serratus major, and other neighbouring muscles, to the common integuments, and even to the nerves. Below the fold of the arm, it divides into two principal branches, one called arteria cubitalis, the other radialis.\n\nFrom its upper and inner part, it sends off a particular branch, which runs obliquely downward and backward over the anconei, and then turns forward again, near the external condyle, where it communicates with a branch of the arteria radialis.\n\nImmediately below the insertion of the teres major, it gives off another branch, which runs from within outwards, and from behind forward, round the os humeri; and descends obliquely forward, between the musculus brachii, and anconeus externus, to both which it is distributed in its passage. Having afterwards reached the external condyle, it unites with the branch last mentioned, and likewise communicates with a branch of the arteries of the fore-arm, so that there is here a triple anastomosis.\n\nAbout the breadth of a finger below this second branch, the brachial artery sends off a third, which runs down towards the internal condyle, and communicates with other branches of the arteries of the fore-arm, as we shall see hereafter.\n\nAbout the middle of the arm, or a little lower, much about the place where the brachial artery begins to be covered by the biceps, it sends off a branch, which is distributed\ndistributed to the periosteum, and penetrates the bone, between the musculus brachii and anconaeus internus.\n\nAbout an inch lower, it gives off another branch, which having furnished ramifications to the anconaeus internus, runs over the inner condyle, and likewise communicates with branches of the arteries of the fore-arm.\n\nHaving got below the middle of the arm, the brachial artery detaches another branch, which runs behind the inner condyle, in company with a considerable nerve; and having passed over the muscles inserted in this condyle, it communicates with that branch of the cubital artery which encompasses the fold of the arm.\n\nA little lower, it sometimes sends out another branch, which passes on the fore-side of the inner condyle, and then communicates with a branch which runs up from the cubital artery. These three communicating branches are termed collateral arteries.\n\nThe common trunk of the brachial artery having reached the fold of the arm, runs, together with a vein and a nerve, immediately under the aponeurosis of the biceps, and passes under the vena mediana, detaching branches on each side to the neighbouring muscles.\n\nAbout a large finger's breadth beyond the fold of the arm, this artery divides into two principal branches, one inner or posterior, named cubitalis; the other outer or anterior, named radialis.\n\nFrom this bifurcation, the brachial artery sends branches on each side, to the supinator longus, pronator teres, fat, and thin. It sometimes, though very rarely, happens, that this artery is divided from its origin into two large branches, which run down on the arm, and afterwards on the fore-arm, where they have the names of cubitalis and radialis.\n\nThe cubital artery sinks in between the ulna and the upper parts of the pronator teres, perforatus, ulnaris gracilis, and radialis internus; then leaving the bone, it runs down between the perforatus and ulnaris internus, all the way to the carpus and great transverse ligament, and sends out several branches.\n\nThe first is a small artery, which runs inward to the inner condyle, and then turns upward, like a kind of recurrent, to communicate by several branches with the collateral arteries of the arm, already mentioned, and particularly with the third. A little lower down, another small branch goes off, which having run upward a little way, and almost surrounded the articulation, communicates with the second collateral artery of the arm, between the olecranon and inner condyle.\n\nAfterwards, the cubital artery having, in its course between the heads of the ulna and radius, reached the interosseous ligaments, sends off two principal branches, one internal, the other external, called the interosseous arteries of the fore-arm.\n\nThe external artery pierces the ligament about three fingers breadth below the articulation, and presently afterwards gives off a branch, which runs up, like a recurrent, toward the external condyle of the os humeri, under the ulnaris externus and anconaeus minimus, to which it is distributed, as also to the supinator brevis.\n\nAfterward, this external interosseous artery runs down on the outside of the ligament, and is distributed to the ulnaris externus, extensor digitorum communis, and to the extenores pollicis indicis and minimi digiti; communicating with some branches of the internal interosseous artery.\n\nHaving reached the lower extremity of the ulna, it unites with a branch of the internal interosseous artery, which, at this place, runs from within outward, and is distributed, together with it, on the convex side of the carpus and back of the hand; communicating with the arteria radialis, and with a branch of the cubitalis.\n\nBy these communications, this artery forms a sort of irregular arch, from whence branches are detached to the external interosseous muscles, and to the external lateral parts of the fingers.\n\nThe internal interosseous artery runs down very close to the ligament, till it reaches below the pronator teres, between which and the pronator quadratus, it perforates the ligament, and goes to the convex side of the carpus and back of the hand, where it communicates with the external interosseous artery, with the radialis and internal branches of the cubitalis.\n\nFrom the origin of the two interosseae, the cubital artery runs down between the perforatus, perforans, and ulnaris internus, along the ulna, sending branches to the neighbouring parts.\n\nAfterward, it passes over the internal transverse ligament of the carpus, by the side of the os pisiforme, and having furnished the skin, palmaris brevis, and metacarpus, it slips under the aponeurosis palmaris, giving off one branch to the hypothenar minimi digiti, and another, which runs toward the thumb, between the tendons of the flexors of the fingers, and the bases of the metacarpal bones.\n\nIt likewise sends off a branch, which, running between the third and fourth bones of the metacarpus, reaches to the back of the hand, where it communicates with the external interosseous artery. Afterwards, having supplied the interosseous muscles, it communicates with the radialis; and they both form an arterial arch, in the hollow of the hand.\n\nThis arch sends from its concave side, towards the second phalanx of the thumb, a branch for the lateral internal part thereof, and then ends near the head of the first metacarpal bone, by a communication with the radialis, having first given a branch to the foreside of the index, and another to the side of the thumb next the former. These communicate, at the ends of the fingers, with the neighbouring branches, as in the other fingers.\n\nThis arch sends likewise small twigs to the interosseous muscles, to the lumbricales, palmaris, and to other neighbouring parts; and, lastly, to the integuments.\n\nThe radial artery begins by detaching a small branch, which runs upward like a recurrent toward the fold of the arm, and turns backward round the external condyle, communicating with the neighbouring branches from the trunk of the brachial artery.\n\nIt runs down along the inside of the radius, between the supinator longus, pronator teres, and the integuments, giving branches to these muscles, and likewise to the perforatus, perforans, and supinator brevis. From thence it runs, in a winding course, towards the extremity of the\nthe radius; supplying the flexors of the thumb and pronator quadratus.\n\nHaving reached the extremity of the radius, it runs nearer the skin, especially toward the anterior edge of the bone, being the artery which we feel there when we examine the pulse.\n\nAt the end of the radius, it gives off a branch to the thenar; and, after having communicated with the arch of the cubital artery in the palm of the hand, and set off some cutaneous branches at that place, it detaches one along the whole internal lateral part of the thumb.\n\nAfterwards it runs between the first phalanx and tendons of the thumb, to the interstice between the basis of this first phalanx, and of the first metacarpal bone, where it turns to the hollow of the hand.\n\nAt this turning, it sends off a branch to the external lateral part of the thumb, which having reached the end thereof, communicates, by a small arch, with the branch which goes to the internal lateral part.\n\nIt likewise sends branches outward, which run between the two first bones of the metacarpus, and the two tendons of the radialis externus; and it communicates with an opposite branch of the cubitalis, together with which it furnishes the external interosseous muscles and integuments of the back of the hand and convex side of the carpus.\n\nLastly, the radial artery terminates, in its passage over the semi-interosseous muscle of the index, near the basis of the first metacarpal bone, and as it runs under the tendons of the flexor muscles of the fingers, where it is joined to the arch of the cubitalis.\n\nIt sends off another branch, which runs along the fore-part of the first bone of the metacarpus, to the convex side of the index, where it is lost in the integuments.\n\nThe left Diaphragmatic artery goes out commonly from the aorta descendens, as it passes between the crura of the small muscle of the diaphragm. The right diaphragmatic comes sometimes from the nearest lumbar artery, but most commonly from the celiaca. These arteries likewise have the name of arteria phrenica.\n\nThey appear almost always in several ramifications on the concave or lower side of the diaphragm, and seldom on the upper or convex side. They give small branches to the glandula renales, or capsula atrabiliaria.\n\nThey send likewise small branches to the fat which lies upon the kidneys, from whence they have the name of arteria adiposa.\n\nBesides these capital diaphragmatic arteries, there are others of a subordinate class, which come from the intercostales, mammae internae, mediafasciae, pericardiae, and celiaca.\n\nThe celiac artery arises anteriorly, and a little to the left hand, from the aorta descendens, immediately after its passage through the small muscle of the diaphragm, nearly opposite to the cartilage, between the last vertebra of the back, and the first of the loins. The trunk of this artery is very short; and near its origin, it sends off from the right side two small diaphragmaticae, though sometimes there is only one, which goes to the right hand, and is afterwards distributed both ways; communicating with the other arteries of the same name, which come from the intercostales and mammae. The left branch sends rami to the superior orifice of the stomach, and to the glandula renalis on the same side; the right furnishes the pylorus, and the renal gland on the right side.\n\nImmediately after this, the celiaca gives off a considerable branch, named arteria ventriculi coronaria, and gastrica, or gastrica superior; and then it presently divides into two large branches, one toward the right hand, named arteria hepatica; the other to the left, called splenica.\n\nThe coronary artery of the stomach goes first to the left side of that organ, a little beyond the superior orifice; round which orifice it throws branches, and also to every part of the stomach near it; and these branches communicate with those which run along the bottom of the stomach to the pylorus.\n\nAfterwards it runs on the right side of the superior orifice, along the small curvature of the stomach, almost to the pylorus, where it communicates with the arteria pylorica; and turning towards the small lobe of the liver, it gives off some branches to it.\n\nThen it advances, under the ductus venosus, to the left lobe of the liver, in which it loses itself near the beginning of the duct, having first given off some small branches to the neighbouring parts of the diaphragm and omentum.\n\nAs soon as the hepatic artery leaves the celiaca, it runs to the upper and inward part of the pylorus, in company with the vena portae, sending off two branches, a small one called arteria pylorica, and a large one named gastrica dextra, or gastrica major.\n\nThe pylorica is ramified on the pylorus, and having distributed branches to the neighbouring parts of the stomach, which communicate with those of the right gastrica, it terminates on the pylorus, by an anastomosis with the coronary artery of the stomach.\n\nThe right gastrica artery having passed behind and beyond the pylorus, sends out a considerable branch, named arteria duodenalis, or intestinalis, which sometimes comes from the trunk of the hepatica, as we shall see hereafter. Afterwards this gastrica artery runs along on the right side of the great curvature of the stomach, to the neighbouring parts of which, on both sides, it distributes branches.\n\nThese branches communicate with those of the arteria pylorica, and of the coronaria ventriculi, and with the right gastro-epiploicae, which furnish the nearest part of the omentum, and communicate with the mesenterica superior. After this, the right gastrica artery ends in the left, which is a branch of the splenica.\n\nThe duodenal or intestinal artery runs along the duodenum on the side next the pancreas; to both which it furnishes branches, and also to the neighbouring part of the stomach.\n\nThe hepatic artery, having sent out the pylorica and right gastrica, advances behind the ductus hepaticus, toward the vesicula fellea, to which it gives two principal branches\nbranches called arteria cystica; and another named bila-\nria, which is lost in the great lobe of the liver.\n\nAfterwards, this artery enters the fissure of the liver,\nand joins the vena portae, with which it runs within a\nmembranous vagina, called capula Glissoni, and accom-\npanies it through the whole substance of the liver by nu-\nmerous ramifications, which may be termed arteriae he-\npaticae proprie.\n\nBefore it enters the liver, it gives small branches to\nthe external membrane of this viscus, and to the capula\nGlissoni.\n\nImmediately after the origin of the splenic artery from\nthe celiaca, it runs toward the left hand, under the sto-\nmach and pancreas, to the spleen. It adheres closely to\nthe posterior part of the lower side of the pancreas, to\nwhich it gives several branches, named arteriae pancreatice.\n\nNear the extremity of the pancreas, under the left\nportion of the stomach, the splenic artery gives off a\nprincipal branch, called gastrica sinistra or minor,\nwhich runs from left to right along the left portion of\nthe great curvature of the stomach, giving branches to\nboth sides of this portion, which communicate with those\nof the coronariae ventriculi.\n\nThis gastrica artery sends likewise another branch at\nleast to the extremity of the pancreas, which commu-\nnicates with the other pancreatic arteries. It also sup-\nplies the omentum with branches, termed gastro-epi-\nploica sinistra; and then it communicates with the right\ngastrica; and from this union, the gastro-epiploica media\nare produced.\n\nAfterwards, the splenic artery advances towards the\nspleen, in a course more or less contorted; but before it\narrives at that viscus, it gives two or three branches to\nthe large extremity of the stomach, commonly called\nvasa brevia; and one to the omentum, named epiploica.\n\nAt the spleen, this artery divides into four or five\nbranches, which enter that viscus, after having given\nsome small twigs to the neighbouring parts of the sto-\nmach and omentum.\n\nThe superior mesenteric artery arises anteriorly from\nthe lower portion of the descending aorta, a very little\nway below the celiaca, going out a little towards the\nright hand, but bending immediately afterwards to the\nleft.\n\nNear its origin, it gives off a small branch, which\ndividing into two, goes to the lower side of the head of\nthe pancreas, and neighbouring part of the duodenum,\ncommunicating with the intestinalis by small arches, and\nareolae or meshes.\n\nAfterwards it passes over the duodenum, between this\nintestine and the mesenteric vein, between the two laminae\nof the mesentery; and then bending in an oblique direc-\ntion from left to right, and from above downward, by\nvery small degrees, it advances toward the extremity of\nthe ileum. By this incursion, it forms a kind of long\narch, from the convex side of which a great many\nbranches go out.\n\nThese branches are sixteen or eighteen in number, or\nthereabouts, and almost all of them are bestowed on the\nsmall intestines, from the lower third part of the duo-\ndenum to the caecum and colon.\n\nAs they approach the intestines, all these branches\ncommunicate, first by reciprocal arches; then by areolar\nand meshes of all kinds of figures; from which is de-\ntached an infinite number of small ramifications, which\nsurround the intestinal canal, like an annular piece of net-\nwork.\n\nThe first branches from the convex side of the mesen-\nteric arch, which are very short, supply the pancreas and\nmesocolon, and communicate with the duodenal artery.\nThe last branches go to the appendicula vermiciformis,\nand send a portion of an arch to the beginning of the\ncolon.\n\nThe considerable branches from the concave side of the\nmesenteric arch, are seldom above two or three in num-\nber; but before they arise, a small ramus goes out to\nthe duodenum, and gives some very small arteries to the\npancreas.\n\nThe first considerable branch from the concave side of\nthe arch goes into the mesocolon towards the right por-\ntion of the colon.\n\nThe second principal branch, having run for some space\nthrough the mesentery, divides into three rami; the first\nof which goes to the lower part of the right portion of\nthe colon, the second goes to the beginning of the colon\nand intestineum caecum.\n\nThe third ramus of the second branch, having com-\nmunicated with the second, gives small twigs to the ce-\ncum, appendicula vermiciformis, and extremity of the\nileum.\n\nThe lower mesenteric artery goes out anteriorly from\nthe aorta descendens inferior, about a finger's breadth\nor more above the bifurcation, and below the spermatic\narteries; and having run about the length of an inch,\nor something more, it is divided into three or four\nbranches.\n\nThe first or superior branch, about an inch from its\norigin, divides into two rami; the first of which runs\nalong the left portion of the colon. The second ramus\nhaving communicated with the first, runs down upon the\nsame portion of the colon.\n\nThe middle branch divides into two rami; one of\nwhich passes upward on the extremity of the colon, com-\nmunicating by arches with the second ramus of the supe-\nrior branch; the other runs down on the extremity of\nthe same intestine.\n\nThe lower branch goes to the second portion of the\ncolon, or to both.\n\nIt sends another considerable branch downward, called\narteria hemorrhoidalis interna, which runs down behind\nthe intestineum rectum, to which it is distributed by sev-\neral ramifications.\n\nThe renal arteries, commonly called emulgents, are\nordinarily two in number, and go out laterally from the\ninferior descending aorta, immediately under the mesen-\nterica superior, one to the right hand, the other to the\nleft.\n\nThey run commonly without division, and almost hori-\nzontally to the kidneys, into the depressions of which\nthey enter by several branches, which form arches in the\ninner substance of these viscera.\n\nFrom these arches, numerous small rami go out to-\n\nVol. I. No. 10.\nward the circumference or outer surface of the kidneys.\n\nOrdinarily, the right renal artery passes behind the vena cava and renal vein on the other side; and the left artery, first behind and then before the vein.\n\nThe arteries of the renal glands, which may be termed arteriae capsulares, arise sometimes from the aorta above the arteria renalis, and give out the arteriae adiposae, which go to the fat of the kidneys. Sometimes they come from the trunk of the celica. The right capsular artery comes most commonly from the arteria renalis of the same side, near its origin; the left from the aorta, above the renalis.\n\nThe spermatic arteries are commonly two in number, sometimes more. They are very small, and go out anteriorly from the aorta descendens inferior, near each other, about a finger's breadth below the arteriae renales, between the two mesenteric\u00e6, or between the renales and mesenteric\u00e6 inferiores.\n\nThey send off to the common membrane of the kidney small branches, named arteriae adiposae; and afterwards they run down upon the psoas muscles, on the fore-side of the ureters, between the two laminae of the peritoneum.\n\nThey give several considerable branches to the peritoneum, and communicate both with the mesenteric\u00e6 and adiposae. They likewise send small arteries to the ureters.\n\nAfterwards, they pass in men through the tendinous openings of the abdominal muscles in the vagina of the peritoneum, and are distributed to the testicles and epididymis, where they communicate with a branch of the iliaca externa.\n\nIn women they do not go out of the abdomen, but are distributed to the ovaria and uterus, and communicate with branches of the hypogastrica, at the jagged extremities of the tubes Fallopian\u00e6.\n\nThe lumbar arteries go out posteriorly from the inferior descending aorta, in five or six pairs, or more, much in the same manner with the intercostals.\n\nThey may be divided into superior and inferior. The superior send small branches to the neighbouring parts of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, and supply the place of semi-intercostal arteries.\n\nThey are distributed on each side to the psoas muscles, to the quadrati lumborum, and to the oblique and transverse muscles of the abdomen; and by perforating the oblique muscles, they become external hypogastric arteries. They go likewise to the vertebral muscles, and to the bodies of the vertebrae, and enter the spinal canal through the lateral notches, to go to the membranes, &c., forming rings much in the same manner with the intercostals.\n\nThe arteriae sacrae go out commonly from the back part of the inferior descending aorta, at the bifurcation. They are two, three, or four in number, and sometimes but one. They are ramified on the os sacrum, and on the neighbouring parts of the peritoneum, intestinum rectum, fat, &c., and enter the canal of that bone through the anterior holes, being thereby distributed toward each side. They likewise send small arteries to the large fasciculi of nerves, which go out through the holes of the os sacrum, and they penetrate the inner substance of that bone.\n\nThe inferior descending aorta ends at the last vertebra of the loins, and sometimes higher, in two large lateral branches, one on the right hand, the other on the left, called arteriae iliac\u00e6; each of which is a common trunk to two other arteries of the same name. This bifurcation lies on the anterior and left side of that of the vena cava.\n\nThe primitive iliac arteries divericate gradually as they descend, advancing obliquely toward the anterior and lower part of the os ilium, without any considerable ramification for about the breadth of three fingers, except a few very small arteries that go to the os sacrum. They likewise give small arteries to the peritoneum, to the coats of the veins, and to the fat and ureters.\n\nThe right iliac trunk passes first on the fore-side of the origin of the left iliac vein, and runs down on the fore-side of the right vein, almost to the place where it goes out of the abdomen, its course being there directed more inwardly. The left trunk goes down likewise before the left vein, but lies a little toward the inside as it leaves the abdomen.\n\nAbout three fingers breadth from their origin, each iliac trunk is divided into two secondary arteries, one external, the other internal. The external artery has no particular name; the internal is termed hypogastrica.\n\nThe external iliac on each side runs down on the iliac muscle to the ligamentum Fallopii, under which it goes out of the abdomen. In this course, it gives off only a few small arteries to the peritoneum, and other parts near it; but as it passes out of the abdomen under the ligament, it detaches two considerable branches, one internal, the other external.\n\nThe internal branch is named arteria epigastrica, and goes out anteriorly from the external iliac. From thence it runs obliquely upward on the tendon of the transverse muscle towards the posterior part of the rectus.\n\nAfterwards the epigastric artery runs up along the posterior or inner side of this muscle, sending ramifications to the tendons of the neighbouring muscles, &c., and then loses itself by a true anastomosis of several ramifications, with the mammae interna.\n\nThe external branch of the outer iliac goes off laterally from the outside of that artery under the ligamentum Fallopii, and from thence to the internal labium of the os ilium, where it divides into two, and is ramified on the oblique and transverse muscles of the abdomen communicating with the arteria lumbaris.\n\nBesides these two branches, the external iliac gives off a small ramus internally, under the ligament, which runs to the vagina of the spermatic rope; and sometimes another small twig goes from the outside to the os ilium.\n\nThe internal iliac or hypogastrica, having run a little more than a finger's breadth inward and backward, bends by small degrees obliquely forward, and toward the outside; and afterwards contracting in its dimensions, it ends in the umbilical artery, which ought to be looked upon as a true continuation of the trunk of the hypogastrica.\n\nThis arteria umbilicalis ascends on the side of the bladder, and having detached small rami to that viscus and to the neighbouring parts of the peritoneum, &c., it contracts, and in adults is quite closed up above the middle.\nmiddle of the bladder. It likewise gives branches to the uterus, and to the neighbouring parts in both sexes. Afterwards it ascends in form of a ligament to the umbilicus, where it joins the umbilical artery on the other side.\n\nFrom the convex side of the curvature of the hypogastric artery, four or five principal branches commonly go out very near each other, viz., iliaca minor, glutea, sciatica, pudica communis, five pudica hypogastrica, and obturatrix.\n\nThe iliaca minor, the most posterior of these branches, and which is often no more than a ramus of the glutea, passes between the last two lumbar nerves, and divides into two rami, one of which enters the canal of the os sacrum through the lowest large anterior holes; the other passes behind the musculus psoas, to which it gives twigs, and behind the crural nerve, being afterwards distributed to the iliac muscle, and to the middle part of the inside of the os ilium, penetrating into the substance of the bone sometimes by one hole, sometimes by more.\n\nThe arteria glutea is sometimes the largest of all the hypogastric branches. Near its beginning it sometimes sends out the iliaca minor, and sometimes the small ramus that goes from that artery to the os sacrum and other parts fixed to that bone. Afterwards this artery goes out of the pelvis, in company with the sciatic nerve, through the upper part of the great sinus of the os innominatum, below the musculus pyriformis, and is distributed, in a radiated manner, to the gluteus maximus and medius.\n\nIn its passage, it gives some branches to the os sacrum, os coccygis, musculus pyriformis, the muscles of the anus, and to the neighbouring parts of the intestinum rectum, forming a particular hemorrhoidalis interna. It likewise sends twigs to the bladder and parts near it; and detaches a pretty long branch, which runs down with the sciatic nerve.\n\nThe arteria sciatica gives first of all some branches to the musculus pyriformis, the quadrigemini, the os f\u00e6num, &c., and even to the inner side of the os ischium. It likewise detaches a branch, which runs under the musculus quadratus, to the articulation of the os femoris.\n\nThe pudica communis, called commonly pudica interna, arises sometimes by a trunk common to it and to the glutea, and gives out two principal branches; the first of which passes through the great sinus of the os ilium, in company with the glutea and sciatica, and then divides into two rami.\n\nThe first ramus goes behind the spine of the ischium, between the two ligaments which lie between that bone and the os sacrum; and runs on the inside of the tuberculum ischii, all the way to the origin of the corpus cavernosum penis. There it divides into several arteries, one of which goes to the sphincter ani, under the name of hemorrhoidalis externa.\n\nThe rest are distributed to the neighbouring integuments, to the bulb of the urethra, and to the corpus cavernosum penis; but the last of these arteries, or rather the extremity of this first ramus, runs from behind forward, over the neck of the os femoris, and communicates with a branch of the arteria cruralis.\n\nThe second principal ramus, called commonly arteria pudica externa, runs between the bladder and intestinum rectum, and is distributed in men to the vesicule seminales, neck of the bladder, prostate gland, and neighbouring parts of the rectum.\n\nAfterwards it runs under the os pubis on the side of a considerable vein, which lies directly under the symphyss; and it runs along the penis between this vein and a nerve, being distributed in its passage to the corpus cavernosum, and communicating with the pudica minor, which comes from the cruralis.\n\nThis second branch of the pudica major goes off sometimes separately from the hypogastrica, especially in women, being distributed to the lateral parts of the uterus, where it communicates with the spermatic artery, near the jagged extremity of the tuba Fallopiana, and to the neighbouring parts of the vagina, &c.\n\nThe arteria obturatrix perforates the obturator muscles, and goes out of the pelvis at the upper part of the ligament of the foramen ovale, having first sent a small branch over the symphyss of the os ilium and os pubis, to the inguinal glands and integuments.\n\nAs it passes by the muscles, it divides and is distributed to the pectineus and triceps. It likewise sends out another branch, which communicates with that branch of the sciatica that goes to the articulation of the os femoris; and gives small arteries to the holes in the neck of that bone.\n\nThe iliac artery goes out of the abdomen, between the ligamentum Fallopii and tendon of the psoas, at the union of the os ilium and os pubis, and there it takes the name of arteria vuralis.\n\nIt sends off, first of all, three small branches; one of which, called pudica externa, goes over the crural vein to the skin and ligament of the penis, and to the inguinal glands, communicating with the pudica interna. The second goes to the musculus pectineus; and the third to the upper part of the sartorius. All these branches furnish likewise the neighbouring anterior integuments.\n\nAfterwards the crural artery runs down on the head of the os femoris; and, by taking a particular turn, gets on the inside of the crural vein, about three fingers breadth from where it goes out of the abdomen.\n\nIn changing its situation, it sends out three considerable branches, one external, one middle, and one internal.\n\nThe external branch runs on the upper side of the thigh to the crureus, vastus externus, rectus anterior, musculus fasciae latae, and gluteus medius; sending up a ramus to the apex of the great trochanter, which communicates with the first principal ramus of the pudica major and sciatica.\n\nThe middle branch runs down on the inside of the thigh between the triceps muscles, to which it gives several rami, one whereof perforates the second muscle, and is distributed to the gluteus maximus, semi-nervosus, semi-membranosus, biceps, and to the neighbouring integuments.\n\nThe internal branch runs backward on the quadrigemini, towards the great trochanter; and having detached a ramus, which goes into the joint of the os femoris,\nit runs downward, and gives rami to all the muscles that lie on the backside of that bone, one of which enters the bone itself on one side of the linea alpina.\n\nHaving sent off all these three branches, the arteria cruralis runs down between the sartorius, vastus intermus, and triceps, giving branches to all the parts near it. It is covered by the sartorius all the way to the lower part of the thigh, where it is inflected backward over the triceps tertius a little above the internal condyle of the os femoris. Afterwards, continuing its course through the hollow of the ham, it is called arteria poplitea.\n\nThe poplitea, while in the ham, is covered only by the integument, sending off branches toward each side, which run up upon the condyles, and communicate with the lower ramifications of the arteria cruralis.\n\nIt sends rami to the joint of the knee, one of which at least passes between the cruciate ligaments. As it runs down, it sends branches to the gastrocnemii and popliteus; and having reached the backside of the head of the tibia, it gives off two branches, one to each side.\n\nThe first or internal branch surrounds the fore-part of the head of the tibia, passing between the bone and internal lateral ligament; and besides several other ramifications, sends up a small branch, which communicates with the arteries that lie round the condyles of the os femoris.\n\nThe second or external branch runs over the head of the fibula, and between the head of the tibia and external lateral ligament of the knee, surrounding the articulation all the way to the ligament of the patella, and communicating with the branches which lie round the condyles of the os femoris, together with a branch of the first or internal ramus.\n\nImmediately after the origin of these two rami, and before the poplitea ends, it sends a small artery down on the backside of the interosseous ligament, very near the tibia, into which it enters by a particular hole a little above the middle portion of the bone.\n\nAs the poplitea ends, it divides into two principal branches, one of which runs between the heads of the tibia and fibula, passing from behind forwards on the interosseous ligament, where it takes the name of arteria tibialis anterior. The second branch divides into two others; one internal and largest, called arteria peronae anterior; the other posterior and smallest, named arteria peronae posterior.\n\nThe tibialis anterior, having passed between the heads of the tibia and fibula, sends small branches upward and laterally. The superior branches communicate with those rami of the popliteus which lie round the articulation; and the lateral branches go to the neighbouring parts. Afterwards this tibial artery runs down on the foreside of the interosseous ligament, toward the outside of the tibia, between the musculus tibialis anticus and extensor pollicis.\n\nHaving run laterally on the tibia for about two thirds of the length of that bone, it passes on the foreside under the common annular ligament, and extensor pollicis, to the articulation of the foot; giving off several rami both to the right and left hand, which communicate laterally with the tibialis posterior and peronae posterior, so that these two bones are in a manner surrounded by arteries.\n\nAt the joint of the foot, it sends out branches which run between the astragalus and os calcis, being distributed to the articulation and to the bones of the tarso.\n\nHaving passed the fold of the foot, it sends off, toward both sides, other rami, which communicate with the posterior tibialis and peronae; all these branches making a kind of circles round the tarso.\n\nAfterwards the anterior tibial artery advances on the convex side of the foot, as far as the interstice between the first and second metatarsal bones; between the heads of which it sends a large branch, which perforates the superior interosseous muscles, and, joining the tibialis posterior, forms an arch on the side of the foot.\n\nIt likewise sends two or three considerable branches over the other metatarsal bones, which go to the rest of the interosseous muscles, integuments, &c., and communicate with each other.\n\nLastly, This artery terminates by two principal branches, one of which goes to the thenar and inside of the great toe; the other is spent upon the outside of the great toe, and the inside of the second toe.\n\nThe tibialis posterior, called likewise suralis, runs down between the solei, tibialis posticus, flexor digitorum communis, and flexor pollicis; giving branches to these muscles, to the tibia, and to the marrow of that bone, through a particular canal in its posterior and upper part.\n\nAfterwards it runs behind the inner ankle, communicating with the tibialis anterior, and surrounded by the neighbouring veins; and passes to the sole of the foot between the concave side of the os calcis and thenar muscle, where it divides into two branches, one large or external, the other small or internal.\n\nThe great branch, or arteria plantaris externa, passes on the concave side of the os calcis obliquely under the sole of the foot, to the basis of the fifth metatarsal bone, and from thence runs in a kind of arch toward the great toe, communicating there with the tibialis anterior, which perforates the interosseous muscles.\n\nThe convex side of this arch supplies both sides of the last three toes, and the outside of the second toe, forming small communicating arches as in the hand.\n\nThe small branch, or arteria plantaris interna, having reached beyond the middle of the sole of the foot, is divided into two; one of which goes to the great toe, communicating with the ramus of the tibialis anterior; the other is distributed to the first phalanges of the other toes, communicating with the ramifications from the arch already mentioned.\n\nThe arteria peronae runs down on the backside of the fibula, between the soleus and flexor pollicis, to which, and to the neighbouring parts, it gives rami in its passage.\n\nHaving reached to the lower third part of the fibula, it sends off a considerable branch, which runs in between the tibia and that bone, passing between their extremities from behind forward, below the interosseous ligament, and is distributed to the integuments of the tarso.\n\nLastly,\nLastly, the peronea continuing its course downward, on the backside of the fibula, as far as the os calcis, forms an arch with the tibialis posterior, between the astragalus and the tendo-achillis.\n\nFrom thence it runs outward, and a little above the outer ankle communicates with the tibialis anterior by an arch, which sends several small ramifications to the neighbouring parts.","sp":269,"ep":281},{"h":"PART IV","t":"OF THE VEINS.\n\nThe blood, distributed to all parts of the body by two kinds of arteries, the aorta and arteria pulmonaris, returns by three kinds of veins, called by anatomists vena cava, vena portae, and vena pulmonaris.\n\nThe vena cava carries back to the right auricle of the heart, the blood conveyed by the aorta to all parts of the body except what goes by the arteriae coronariae cordis. It receives all this blood from the arterial ramifications in part directly, and in part indirectly.\n\nThe vena portae receives the blood carried to the floating viscera of the abdomen by the arteria celiaca and the two mesentericae, and conveys it to the vena hepatica, and from thence to the vena cava.\n\nThe vena pulmonaris conveys to the pulmonary sinus, or left auricle of the heart, the blood carried to the lungs by the arteria pulmonaris.\n\nWe commonly talk of the vena cava in general, as if it were but one vein at its origin, or had but one common trunk; whereas it goes out from the right auricle of the heart by two large separate trunks, in a direction almost perpendicularly opposite to each other, one running upward, called vena cava superior; the other downward, called vena cava inferior.\n\nThe vena cava superior is distributed chiefly to the thorax, head, and upper extremities, and but very little to the parts below the diaphragm.\n\nThe vena cava inferior is distributed chiefly to the abdomen and lower extremities, and but very little to the parts above the diaphragm.\n\nThe trunk of each of these two veins sends off, much in the same manner with the arteries, a certain number of principal or capital branches, which are afterwards ramified in different manners. Each trunk terminates afterwards by a bifurcation or a division into two subordinate trunks, each of which gives off other principal branches, ending in a great number of small trunks, rami, and ramifications.\n\nThe superior vena cava runs up from the right auricle of the heart, almost in a direct course, for about two fingers breadth, lying within the pericardium, in the right side of the trunk of the aorta, but a little more anteriorly.\n\nAs it goes out of the pericardium, it is inclined a little to the left hand, and then runs up as high as the cartilage of the first true rib, and a little higher than the curvature of the aorta. At this place it terminates by a bifurcation or division into two large branches or subordinate trunks, one of which runs toward the left hand, the other toward the right.\n\nThese two branches are named subclavie, as lying behind the clavicle.\n\nThe trunk of the superior cava, from where it leaves the pericardium to the bifurcation, sends out anteriorly several small branches. These branches are the vena mediastina, pericardia, diaphragmatica superior, thymica, mammae interna, and trachealis.\n\nAll these small branches from the trunk of the cava superior are termed dextra; and their fellows on the other side, called sinistrae, do not arise from the trunk, but from the left subclavia.\n\nPosteriorly, a little above the pericardium, the trunk of the superior cava sends out a capital branch, called vena azygos, or vena sine pari, which runs down on the right side of the bodies of the vertebrae dorfi, almost to the diaphragm; giving off the greatest part of the venae intercostales and lumbares superiores.\n\nThe two subclavie run laterally or toward each side, and terminate as they go out of the thorax, between the first rib and clavicle.\n\nThe right subclavian, which is the shortest of the two, commonly sends out four capital branches; the jugularis externa, jugularis interna, vertebralis, and axillaris.\n\nThe left subclavian being longer than the right, gives off, first of all, the small veins on the left side, answering those on the right side that come from the trunk of the superior cava, viz. the mediastina, pericardia, diaphragmatica superior, thymica, mammae interna, and trachealis.\n\nNext to these small veins, called sinistrae, it detaches another small branch, called intercostalis superior sinistrae, and then four large branches like those from the right subclavian, viz. the jugularis externa, jugularis interna, vertebralis, and axillaris, which are termed sinistrae.\n\nThe external jugular veins are distributed chiefly to the outer parts of the throat, neck and head; and send a small vein to the arm, named cephalica, which assists in forming a large one of the same name.\n\nThe internal jugular veins go to the internal parts of the neck and head, communicating with the sinuses of\nthe dura mater, and in several places with the external jugular veins.\n\nThe vertebral veins pass through the holes in the transverse apophyses of the vertebrae of the neck, sending branches to the neck and occiput. They form the sinus venae of these vertebrae, and communicate with the sinuses of the dura mater.\n\nThe axillary veins are continuations of the subclavie, from where they leave the thorax, to the axilla. They produce the mammae internae, thoracicae, capillares or humerales, and a branch to each arm, which, together with that from the external jugularis, forms the vena cephalica.\n\nAfterwards the axillary vein terminates in the principal vein of the arm, called basilica; which, together with the cephalica, is distributed by numerous ramifications to all parts of the arm, fore-arm, and hand.\n\nThe portion of the inferior vena cava contained in the pericardium is very small, being scarcely the twelfth part of an inch on the fore-part, and not above a quarter of an inch on the back part. From thence it immediately perforates the diaphragm, to which it gives the venae diaphragmaticae inferiores or phrenic\u00e6.\n\nIt passes next behind the liver, through the great sinus of that viscus, to which it furnishes several branches, termed vene hepatic\u00e6.\n\nIn this course it inclines a little toward the spina dorsi and aorta inferior, the trunk and ramifications of which it afterwards accompanies in the abdomen, all the way to the os sacrum.\n\nThus the inferior cava sends out on each side, in the same manner with the aorta, the vene adipose, renales, spermatic\u00e6, lumbares, and sacrae. Having reached to the os sacrum, it loses the name of cava, and terminating by a bifurcation, like that of the descending aorta, it forms the two vene iliac\u00e6.\n\nThese iliac veins having given off the hypogastric\u00e6, with all their ramifications, to the viscera of the pelvis, and to some other external and internal neighbouring parts, go out of the abdomen, under the ligamentum Fallopianum, and there take the name of vene crurales.\n\nEach crural vein sends off numerous ramifications to all the lower extremity.\n\nThe vena azygos or sine pari is very considerable, and arises posteriorly from the superior cava a little above the pericardium.\n\nIt is immediately afterwards bent backward over the origin of the right lung, forming an arch which surrounds the great pulmonary vessels on that side.\n\nFrom thence it runs down on the right side of the vertebrae dorso on one side of the aorta, and before the intercostal arteries; and getting behind the diaphragm, it terminates by a very sensible anastomosis, sometimes with the vena renalis, sometimes with a neighbouring lumbar vein, and sometimes immediately with the trunk of the cava inferior.\n\nThe vena azygos sends out two or three small veins from the top of the arch, one of which goes to the aspera arteria; the others partly to the aspera arteria, and partly to the bronchia, by the name of vene bronchiales, accompanying the ramifications of the bronchial artery.\n\nAfterwards the azygos detaches from the extremity of the arch a small trunk common to two or three small veins, called intercostales superiores dextrae, which bring back the blood from the first three series of intercostal muscles, and from the neighbouring part of the pleura.\n\nThese intercostal veins send branches through the intercostal muscles to the serratus superior posterior, serratus major, &c., and afterwards they run along the interstices between the ribs, communicating with the vene mammariae.\n\nThey likewise send small branches backward to the vertebral muscles and canal of the spine, where they communicate with the venal circles, or sinuses which bring back the blood from the medulla spinalis.\n\nAs the azygos runs down, it sends off the inferior intercostal veins on the right side, one going to each series of intercostal muscles. These veins run along the lower edges of the ribs, and perforate the muscles by branches, which go to the posterior and external part of the thorax.\n\nThey communicate with the vene thoracice, and most commonly with the mammae intern\u00e6; and lastly, more or less with each other, by perpendicular branches, near the posterior extremities of the ribs.\n\nThe azygos sends off likewise the left intercostal veins, but seldom the whole number; for the superior veins come often from the left subclavian. The inferior intercostal veins, to the number of six or seven, come often from the trunk of the azygos; and running between the aorta and vertebrae, they send off almost the same ramifications with the veins on the right side, and likewise some to the oesophagus.\n\nThe azygos, having reached below the last rib, sends off a large branch, which bending outward, perforates the muscles of the abdomen, is ramified between their different planes, and communicates with the like ramifications of the last or last two intercostal veins.\n\nThe pectorales intern\u00e6 are small veins disposed in pairs toward the right and left hand, behind the sternum and parts near it, including the diaphragmatic\u00e6 superiores, or pericardio-diaphragmatic\u00e6, mediafinae, mammae intern\u00e6, thymic\u00e6, pericardic\u00e6, and gutturales or tracheales.\n\nThe right vena mediastina goes out anteriorly from the trunk of the superior cava, a little above the origin of the azygos; the left comes from the subclavia.\n\nThe right superior diaphragmatica, or pericardio-diaphragmatica, comes anteriorly from the root of the bifurcation near the mediastina; and is distributed, by several branches, to the upper, fore, and back parts of the pericardium, communicating with those of the left diaphragmatica. The left superior diaphragmatica comes from the left subclavian, a little below the origin of the mammae.\n\nThe right internal mammae arises anteriorly from the vena cava, a little below the angle of the bifurcation. It runs along the nearest internal or posterior edge of the sternum, and on the cartilaginous extremities of the\nthe right ribs, together with the artery of the same name. Having reached near the diaphragm, it finds a branch which runs toward the tendinous plane, and communicates with the common diaphragmatic veins.\n\nAfterwards this mammary vein gives small branches to the mediastinum, and others between the ribs to the integuments; of which those that pass between and under the cartilages of the last true ribs, run down on the inner or posterior side of the musculi recti abdominis, being ramified among their fleety fibres, and communicating with the epigastric veins by several small twigs.\n\nThe left internal mammaire arises anteriorly from the left subclavian, opposite to the cartilage or anterior extremity of the first true rib.\n\nThe right vena thymica, when it arises separately, goes out from the bifurcation; and when it is wanting, the thymus, from whence it takes its name, is furnished by the gutturalis, or some other neighbouring vein. This vein often reaches no lower than the inferior part of the thymus; and the left vein of the same name comes from the left subclavian, almost opposite to the sternum.\n\nThe right pericardia seems to go out rather from the origin of the right subclavian, than from the trunk of the superior cava. It goes to the upper side of the pericardium; and other-neighbouring parts.\n\nThe right gutturalis or trachealis goes out from the upper part of the bifurcation, above the mammaire of the same side, sometimes more backward, and sometimes from the subclavia. It is distributed to the glandulae thyroidae, trachea arteria, musculi sterno-hyoidei, thymus, and glandula bronchialis. It communicates, by lateral branches, with the internal jugular vein. The left gutturalis comes from the upper or posterior part of the left subclavian, near its origin.\n\nThe right subclavian vein is very short, and its course very oblique, so that it appears to rise higher than the left vein. It sends off, first of all, four large branches, viz. the vertebralis, which is the first and most posterior; the jugularis interna, jugularis externa, and axillaris.\n\nThe left subclavian seems to ascend but very little after the bifurcation; and, in this course, it covers the origin of three large arteries, which come from the curvature of the aorta. It sends off four large branches, besides the small pectoral veins, and receives the ductus thoracicus.\n\nIt likewise gives off, before its principal division, a small trunk for the left superior intercostals, and this intercostal trunk furnishes likewise the left bronchialis.\n\nEach subclavian vein, near the middle of the clav\u00edcula, sends off a branch, called cephalica, which descends near the surface of the body, between the delto\u00efdes and pectoralis major.\n\nEach external jugular vein arises from the subclavian on the same side, sometimes from the axillaris, and sometimes from the union of these two veins. They run up between the musculus cutaneus and sterno-mastoideus.\n\nSometimes they are double from their very origins; and when they are single, each of them divides afterwards into two, one anterior, and the other posterior, or rather superior. The anterior vein goes to the throat and face, running up toward the angle of the lower jaw, and the posterior goes to the temples and occiput.\n\nThe anterior external jugular vein is often a branch of the jugularis interna, and sometimes it comes from the vena axillaris.\n\nIt runs up toward the lateral part of the lower jaw, between the angle and the chin, and sends several branches forwards, backwards, and inwards.\n\nPosteriorly it gives, (1.) A large branch on the side of the upper part of the larynx, which communicates with the jugularis interna, and likewise with a large short branch of the jugularis externa posterior. (2.) A small branch, which has the same communication, but which is not always to be found. (3.) Another small branch a little below the lower jaw, which communicates with the jugularis externa posterior.\n\nAnteriorly it sends several branches to the muscles of the larynx, sterno-hyoidei, thyro-hyoidei, and to the integuments; and below the larynx it sends communicating branches to the jugularis externa anterior of the other side.\n\nA little higher, opposite to the cartilago-thyroides, it gives off a transverse branch, which runs on the anterior and lower part of the musculi sterno-mastoidei, and communicates with the jugularis of the other side.\n\nThe superior and inferior transverse branches communicate on each side by branches more or less perpendicular, and send a small branch to the musculus quadratus of the chin, to the musculus cutaneus and integuments.\n\nIt sends another large branch anteriorly toward the symphysis of the lower jaw, which, after having supplied the maxillary glands, is distributed to the digastric muscle, to the chin and under lip.\n\nInteriorly, at the same place, it sends out a large branch, which furnishes the glandula sublinguales, runs down toward the cornua of the os hyoidei, to communicate with some branches of the jugularis interna, and sends several rami to the tongue, called vena ranine. It gives off likewise a small branch, which running upon the musculus labiorum triangularis, to the commissure of the lips, is distributed to the neighbouring parts.\n\nThe same branch which gives out the vena ranine, detaches another to the lateral parts of the septum palati, which is distributed to the amygdalae, and to the uvula, and sends rami forward to the membrane which lines the arch of the palate. Another branch goes out from it to the pterygoideus internus, peritrophylini, and ephalopharyngei.\n\nAfterwards the trunk of the anterior external jugular vein runs up on the musculus triangularis, where it receives the name of vena triangularis, in a winding course, from the angle of the lower jaw to the great or internal angle of the orbit, sending branches on each side to the muscles and integuments.\n\nThe trunk of the vena angularis having reached the bones of the nose, sends out a branch through the lateral cartilages of the nose, which is distributed to the nares; and another which runs down in a winding course to the upper lip.\n\nAt the great or inner angle of the eye, the same trunk sends off several other branches; the first of which goes\nto the root of the nose, and communicating with its fellow from the other side, gives several small veins to the holes of the osa nasi.\n\nThe second branch runs up on the fore-head, by the name of vena frontalisi, and is distributed to each side.\n\nThe third branch enters the orbit in a winding course, on one side of the cartilaginous pulley, and communicates with the sinuses of the dura mater, by the orbital sinus of the eye.\n\nThe fourth branch goes along the musculus superciliaris and the upper part of the orbicularis, to the small or external angle of the eye, to communicate with the vena temporalis, and with that vein which runs along the lower part of the orbicular muscle.\n\nThe posterior or superior external jugular vein runs upward toward the parotid gland, and lower anterior part of the eye, giving out several branches toward each side.\n\nAt its origin it sends out posteriorly, a principal branch, with its ramifications, to the muscles which cover the scapula and joint of the humerus, commonly called vena muscularis.\n\nA little higher, it gives off the vena cervicalis, which goes to the vertebral muscles of the neck.\n\nNear the cervical vein, but a little more outward, it gives off sometimes the small vena cephalica, which runs down between the pectoralis major and deltoides, and unites with the vena cephalica of the arm.\n\nBackward it detaches the vena occipitalis, which is distributed on the occiput; it likewise sends out a small vein, which enters the cranium by the posterior mastoid hole, and terminates in one of the lateral sinuses of the dura mater.\n\nHaving reached as far as the parotid gland, it forms communications with the anterior external jugular, under the angle of the lower jaw; and then passes through the parotid gland, between that angle and the condyle, giving off a large branch which communicates with another branch common to the internal and anterior external jugulars.\n\nAfterwards it passes before the ear, taking the name of vena temporalis, which is distributed to the temples and lateral parts of the head, towards the occiput and forehead.\n\nThe temporal vein of one side communicates, above, with its fellow on the other side; before, with the vena frontalisi; and behind, with the vena occipitalis. Opposite to the ear, it gives out a large branch, one ramus of which runs under the lower edge of the zygoma, and then returning, communicates with another ramus from the same jugularis, a little below the condyle of the lower jaw.\n\nBehind this condyle, it gives branches to the temporal muscle, to the neighbouring parts of the upper jaw, and to the inside of the lower jaw.\n\nThe internal jugular vein is the largest of those that go to the head.\n\nIt runs up behind the sterno-mastoides and omo-hyoideus, which it crosses, along the sides of the vertebrae of the neck, by the edge of the longus colli, to the fossula of the foramen lacerum of the basis cranii.\n\nThe first branches which it sends off are small, and go to the thyroid glands. About two fingers breadth higher up, it detaches a middle-sized branch, which runs laterally towards the larynx, and may be named vena guturalis.\n\nThis gutural vein divides chiefly into three branches; the lowest of which goes to the thyroid gland and neighbouring muscles; the middle branch to the larynx, musculi thyroidae, &c., and the third runs upward to the great communication between the two jugulares.\n\nAbout the same distance upward, almost opposite to the os hyoidei, the internal jugular gives another branch, which sends rami to the muscles belonging to that bone, and others which communicate with the foregoing branch. This other branch runs upward toward the parotid gland and angle of the lower jaw, where it sends communicating branches forward and backward to the two external jugulares.\n\nThe internal jugular sends another branch backward, which is distributed to the occiput, where it communicates with a branch of the vertebralis, and, through the posterior mastoid hole, with the lateral sinus of the dura mater.\n\nAfterwards it reaches the foramen lacerum of the basis cranii, bending a little, and sending off small twigs to the pharynx and neighbouring muscles.\n\nThe vertebral vein arises posteriorly from the subclavia or axillaris, sometimes by two stems.\n\nThe first and principal stem gives out a branch, called vena cervicalis, which is distributed to the neighbouring muscles, and afterwards runs up through the holes of the transverse apophyses of the vertebrae colli.\n\nThe other item of the vertebral vein runs up on the side of the vertebrae; and having reached the fourth, or sometimes higher, it runs in between the transverse apophyses of that vertebra and the fifth, to join the first or principal stem.\n\nThus the vertebral vein accompanies the artery of the same name, sometimes in one trunk, sometimes in several stems, through all the holes of the transverse apophyses of the vertebrae colli, all the way to the great foramen occipitale, communicating with the occipital veins and small occipital sinuses of the dura mater.\n\nIn its passage it gives off one branch, which enters by the posterior condyloid hole of the os occipitis, and communicates with the lateral sinus of the dura mater.\n\nAs these veins run through the holes in the transverse apophyses, they send branches forward to the anterior muscles of the neck, and to the small anterior muscles of the head.\n\nOther branches go likewise outward and backward to the musculi transversales and vertebrales colli; and inward to the great canal of the spinal marrow, where they form sinuses, which communicate with those on the other side.\n\nThese vertebral sinuses are pretty numerous, and placed one above another all the way to the occiput; the lower communicate with the upper; and at the great foramen of the os occipitis there is a communication between them and the occipital sinuses of the dura mater.\n\nThe subclavian vein having sent off the branches already described, goes out of the thorax, and passes before\nfore the anterior portion of the musculus scalenus, and between the first rib and the clavicle, to the axilla. Through this course it takes the name of vena axillaris, and gives off several branches, the chief of which are the vena muscularis, thoracicae, and vena cephalica.\n\nThe musculars, are distributed to the middle portion of the musculus trapezius, to the angularis, infra-spinatus, and subcapularis; and as some of these branches go to the shoulder exteriorly, others interiorly, the vena scapulares are distinguished into external and internal.\n\nA little before the axillaris reaches the axilla, it sends out the vena thoracicae, one of which is superior, called also mammaria externa, and the other inferior. It likewise sends rami to the musculus subcapularis, teres major, teres minor, supra-spinatus, latissimus dorsi, serratus major, pectoralis minor, pectoralis major, and to the glands of the axilla.\n\nThe axillaris having reached the side of the head of the os humeri, produces a branch, named vena cephalica, and afterwards runs along the arm by the name of vena basilica.\n\nThe cephalic vein, which is a branch of the axillaris, at a small distance from its origin, joins the small cephalica, which runs down from the subclavia, or jugularis externa.\n\nThe great cephalica runs down between the tendons of the last mentioned muscles, and along the outer edge of the external portion of the biceps; communicating several times with the vena basilica, and sending small rami on each side, to the neighbouring muscles, fat and skin.\n\nA little below the external condyle of the os humeri, it detaches a branch backward, which runs up between the musculus brachialis and the upper portion of the supinator longus, and afterwards bends back between the os humeri and anconeus externus, where it communicates with some branches of the basilica.\n\nHaving reached very near the fold of the arm, it is divided into two principal branches, one long, the other short. The long branch is named radialis externa, and the short one may be called mediana cephalica, to distinguish it from another mediana, which is a short branch of the basilica.\n\nThe external radial vein runs along the radius between the muscles and integuments, giving off branches towards both sides, which communicate with other branches of the same vein, and with some from the basilica.\n\nThe mediana cephalica runs down obliquely toward the middle of the fold of the arm, under the integuments, and over the tendon of the biceps, where it joins a short branch of the same kind from the basilica.\n\nFrom this anastomosis, a considerable branch goes out, which runs down on the fore-arm, uniting on one side with the vena cephalica, and communicating on the other with the basilica, by several irregular areoles. The name of mediana is given to this large branch, as well as to the two short ones, by the union of which it is formed.\n\nFrom this union of the two lateral mediane, and sometimes from the origin of the mediana media, a branch goes out, which runs down on the inside of the fore-arm, opposite to the interosseous ligament, and is called vena cubiti profunda. It goes to the neighbouring muscles, and communicates with the other veins of the fore-arm. The mediana cephalica sometimes sends down a long branch, called radialis interna, which lies almost parallel to the radialis externa.\n\nAfterwards the cephalica, having reached the extremity of the radius, is distributed, by numerous areoles, almost in the same course with the radial artery.\n\nA particular branch goes out from it, which runs more or less superficially between the thumb and metacarpus, by the name of cephalica pollicis. The areoles furnish the interosseous muscles and integuments, and communicate with a small ramus from the basilica, called by the ancients Salvatella.\n\nThe basilica vein sends off first of all, under the head of the os humeri, a pretty large branch, which passes almost tranversely round the neck of that bone, from within backward, and from behind outward, running upon the scapula, where it is ramified on the deltoides, and communicates with the vena scapulares externae. This branch may be named vena sub-humeralis, or articularis.\n\nThis articular vein sends down two principal branches, one of which runs along the inside of the bone, to which, and to the periosteum, it gives small veins. The other turns forward, toward the middle of the arm between the bone and the biceps, and communicates with the cephalica.\n\nBelow the neck of the os humeri, near the hollow of the axilla, and behind the tendon of the pectoralis major, the basilica sends out a considerable branch, which runs down on the side of the brachial artery, and furnishes the neighbouring muscles on both sides. This vein is named profunda brachii.\n\nImmediately afterwards, the basilica detaches two or three small veins, which run down very closely joined to the brachial artery, surrounding it at different distances by small twigs which communicate with each other.\n\nThese small veins, which often arise from the profunda superior, communicate with the basilica and cephalica; and having reached the fold of the arm, they divide like the artery; and the same divisions are continued along the whole fore-arm.\n\nAfterwards the basilica continues its course along the inside of the os humeri, between the muscles and integuments, forming many communications with the vena profunda and cephalica, and supplying the muscles and integuments.\n\nHaving reached the inner condyle, and having sent off obliquely, in the fold of the arm, the mediana basilica, it runs along the ulna, between the integuments and muscles, a little toward the outside, by the name of cubitalis externa.\n\nThe basilica having at length reached the extremity of the ulna, sends several branches to the convex side of the carpus; one of which, named Salvatella, goes to that side of the little finger next the ring finger, having first communicated with the cephalica, by means of the venal areole conspicuous on the back of the hand. In the other fingers this vein follows nearly the same course with the arteries.\nIn general, the external or superficial veins of the forearm are larger than the internal.\n\nThe inferior Vena Cava having run down about a quarter of an inch from the right auricle of the heart, within the pericardium, pierces that membrane and the tendinous portion of the diaphragm.\n\nAt this place it gives off the ven\u00e6 diaphragmatic\u00e6, or phrenic\u00e6, which are distributed to the diaphragm, and appear chiefly on its lower side, one towards the right hand, and one towards the left. The right vein is more backward and lower than the left. The left is distributed partly to the pericardium, and partly to the diaphragm; and sometimes they send rami to the capsulae renales.\n\nThe inferior cava having perforated the diaphragm, passes through the posterior part of the great fissure of the liver, penetrating a little into the substance of that viscus, between the great lobe and the lobulus Spigelii.\n\nIn its passage, it sends off commonly three large branches, called ven\u00e6 hepatic\u00e6, which are ramified in the liver.\n\nBesides these large branches, it sends out some other small ones, either before or immediately after it goes out of the liver.\n\nIn the fetus, as the vena cava passes by the liver, it gives off the ductus venosus, which communicates with the sinus of the vena port\u00e6; and in adults is changed to a flat ligament.\n\nAfter its passage through the liver, the vena cava turns from before backward, and from right to left, toward the spina dorsi, placing itself on the right side of the aorta, which it accompanies from thence downward.\n\nHaving got as low as the arteriae renales, it gives off the veins of the same name, termed formerly ven\u00e6 e-mulgentes.\n\nThe right renal runs down a little obliquely, because of the situation of the kidney. The left vein crosses on the foreside of the trunk of the aorta, immediately above the superior mesenteric artery.\n\nThey send up the ven\u00e6 capsulares, which go to the glandulae renales, and downward; the ven\u00e6 adipof\u00e6, which go to the fatty covering of the kidneys; and ordinarily the left renal vein furnishes the left spermatic vein. Afterwards they run to the sinus, or cavity of the kidneys, in the substance of which they are distributed by numerous ramifications.\n\nA little below the renal veins, the trunk of the cava sends out anteriorly, toward the right side, the right vena spermatica. The left spermatic vein comes commonly from the left renalis.\n\nIn their passage, they send several small branches on each side, to the peritoneum and mesentery, where they seem to be joined by anastomoses with the ven\u00e6 mafa-raic\u00e6.\n\nThe cava sends likewise off posteriorly the ven\u00e6 lumbares, which commonly arise in pairs. These may be divided into superior and inferior veins.\n\nTheir origins vary in different manners. Sometimes the cava gives off a branch to each side below the first vertebra of the loins, which, like a common trunk, furnishes the lumbar veins. This branch communicates with the azygos.\n\nSometimes a considerable branch goes out from the lower extremity of the cava, near the bifurcation, chiefly on the right side, which afterwards running up between the bodies and transverse apophyses of the vertebrae, detaches the ven\u00e6 lumbares, and communicates with the azygos.\n\nSometimes a like branch comes from the beginning of the left vena ilica, and, running up on that side in the same manner, produces the lumbares.\n\nThe ven\u00e6 lumbares on one side communicate by transverse branches with those of the other side, and likewise with each other by branches more or less longitudinal. The first and second often go from the azygos, and thereby they communicate with the intercostal veins.\n\nThe lumbar veins send small capillaries, in their passage, to the substance of the bodies of the vertebrae; and they are distributed to the muscles of the abdomen, quadratus lumborum, psoas, iliacus, &c. They send branches backward to the neighbouring vertebral muscles, and to the canal of the spine, and communicate with the venal sinuses.\n\nThe inferior cava, having reached as low as the last vertebra of the loins, and near the bifurcation of the aorta, runs behind the right iliac artery, and there is divided into two subaltern trunks, called the right and left iliac veins.\n\nFrom this bifurcation of the vena cava, the vena sacra goes out, and accompanies the artery of the same name in its distribution to the os sacrum, to the nerves which lie there, and to the membranes which cover both sides of that bone.\n\nEach original iliac vein is divided on the side of the os sacrum, much after the same manner as the arteries, into two large trunks.\n\nOne of these trunks is named vena iliaca externa or anterior; the other interna or posterior.\n\nThese veins follow nearly the course and distribution of the iliac arteries, except that the hypogastric vein does not send off the vena umbilicalis.\n\nFrom the common trunk of the iliac veins, and sometimes from the origin of the iliaca externa, a particular branch goes out, which is distributed to the musculus psoas, iliacus, and quadratus lumborum; and afterwards sends a ramus on the fore-side of the last transverse apophysis of the loins, to communicate with the left lumbar vein.\n\nThe external iliac, a little before it leaves the abdomen, near the ligamentum Fallopii, lying on the psoas and iliac muscles, gives off almost the same branches with the artery of the same name, and follows the same course. The chief branches are these:\n\nA little before it goes out of the abdomen, it sends off from the outside, a small branch, which runs up along the crista of the os ilium, and gives branches on each side to the lateral and posterior lower portions of the musculi abdominis, to the musculus iliacus, &c.\n\nFrom the inside, before it leaves the abdomen, it sends off the vena epigastrica; which having furnished some small rami to the neighbouring conglomerated glands, runs up along the inside of the musculi recti, on which it is ramified both ways.\n\nAfterwards\nAfterwards the vena epigastrica runs upward, and joins the ramifications of the mammae.\n\nBefore the iliac vein gets from under the ligamentum Fallopii, it sends several small rami to the neighbouring lymphatic glands; and immediately afterwards, losing the name of iliaca, it takes that of cruralis.\n\nThe hypogastric, or internal iliac vein, runs behind the iliac artery, from which the following branches go out.\n\nFrom the posterior or convex part of the arch, it gives a branch to the superior lateral part of the os sacrum, which is distributed to the musculus facer, or tranversospinalis lumborum, and other muscles thereabouts, and to the cavity of the bone, which it enters through the first great hole.\n\nA little lower, on the same side, it sends out another, which is distributed much in the same manner with the former, and enters the second hole.\n\nFrom the external lateral part of the same arch, a little anteriorly, it sends out a large branch, which runs behind the great sciatic sinus, and is distributed to the musculi glutaei, pyriformis, and gemelli.\n\nLower down, the same lateral part of the hypogastric vein gives out another large branch, called obturatrix; which, having run a little way, detaches several rami, and afterwards reaching the foramen ovale of the os innominatum, perforates the obturator muscles, communicates with the vena cruralis, and is distributed to the musculus pectineus, triceps, and neighbouring parts.\n\nAmong the branches sent off by the vena obturatrix, before it perforates the muscles, one is situated exteriorly, which runs toward the sciatic sinus, to the musculus iliacus, the superior part of the obturator internus, and to the os ilium.\n\nInteriorly, the same obturator vein sends off another branch, which is distributed to the ureters, bladder, and internal parts of generation in both sexes.\n\nLastly, the hypogastric vein runs backward, and goes out of the pelvis, above the ligament which lies between the inferior lateral part of the os sacrum and spine of the ilium.\n\nIt next sends a large branch upward to the lower part of the os sacrum, and two or more downward; which, running behind the same ligament, are distributed to the buttocks, anus, neighbouring portion of the musculus pectineus, and to the external parts of generation.\n\nThe veins that go to the anus, are termed hemorrhoidales externae; they that go to the parts of generation, pudicae internae. The external hemorrhoidales communicate with the internal veins of the same name, which come from the small vena mesafarica.\n\nThe crural vein goes out under the ligamentum Fallopii, on the inside of the crural artery, and immediately gives small branches to the inguinal glands, the musculus pectineus, and parts of generation. These last are termed pudicae externae, and evidently communicate with the internal veins of the same name.\n\nAbout an inch below, where it leaves the abdomen, the crural vein produces a large branch, which runs down anteriorly between the integuments and the farto-\n\nrius, following the direction of that muscle almost all the way to the inside of the thigh.\n\nThis branch having afterwards got beyond the condyles of the os femoris, runs down between the integuments and inner angle of the tibia, to the fore-part of the inner ankle, and is distributed to the foot. All this large branch is named vena saphena, or saphena major.\n\nAfter the origin of the saphena, as the trunk of the crural veins runs down, it sinks in between the muscles, and is distributed to all the inner or deep parts of the lower extremity, accompanying the crural artery to the very extremity of the foot.\n\nAs the saphena is a vein of very large extent, we shall here describe it altogether, and afterwards return to the vena cruralis.\n\nThe vena saphena, in its passage from the inguen to the foot, is covered only by the skin and fat. Immediately after its rise, it gives small veins to the inferior inguinal glands; and then it gives out others more anteriorly, which, running under the integuments, communicate with each other by numerous areole.\n\nThe saphena, having run down on the thigh, as low as the middle of the sartorius, sends off to the same side several branches, which communicate with each other, and with the superior branches.\n\nBetween these upper and lower branches, the saphena sends backward a particular branch; which, after being distributed to the integuments which cover the gracilis internus and triceps, turns backward; and a little below the ham, runs in among the muscles situated there, and communicates with another branch, which may be termed saphena minor.\n\nAfterwards the trunk of the great saphena runs down on the inside of the tibia, lying always near the skin; and at the upper part of that bone it sends branches forward, outward, and backward.\n\nThe anterior branches go to the integuments on the upper part of the leg; the posterior, to those which cover the gastrocnemii, and communicate with the little saphena; and the external branches are likewise distributed to the fat and integuments, and having reached as low as the middle of the tibia, it sends a communicating branch to the trunk of the great saphena.\n\nFrom this communication, a branch goes out anteriorly, which runs along the integuments of the tibia all the way to the outer ankle.\n\nAs the saphena runs down on the inside of the tibia, it sends out a branch near the middle of that bone, which runs up behind the tendons of the sartorius, gracilis internus, and femi-nervosus, then between the tibia and upper end of the fibula, and is joined by an anastomosis with the crural vein.\n\nAt the lower part of the tibia, the saphena produces a considerable branch, which runs obliquely forward over the joint of the tarus toward the outer ankle, sending off several rami which communicate with each other, and with the trunk of the saphena.\n\nThe extremity of this trunk passes on the foreside of the inner ankle, and runs irregularly under the skin, al-\nlong the interstice between the first two metatarsal bones toward the great toe, where this vein terminates.\n\nThe crural vein, having sent off the saphena, and the small branches for the pectineus, &c., as has been said, runs down on the thigh behind the crural artery. Opposite to the little trochanter, it produces two large short branches, or one which afterwards divides into two, whereof one is anterior, the other posterior.\n\nThe anterior branch runs more or less transversely forward, to be distributed to the vastus internus, lower part of the pectineus, and of the second triceps, and to the other two muscles of the same name, running in between them as it goes from one to another.\n\nThe posterior branch runs more or less transversely backward, and furnishes the glutei, vastus externus, and beginning of the biceps.\n\nA little below these two branches, about the upper extremity of the vastus internus, the crural vein produces a branch which runs down on the side of the trunk, covering the crural artery, almost as low as the ham, where it is again united to the trunk by an anastomosis. It has the name of vena sciatica, from the sciatic nerve which it accompanies.\n\nOn the outside of this anastomosis, the crural vein gives off a branch which runs backward between the biceps and neighbouring muscles, and so downward on the backside of the leg a little exteriorly, and very near the skin, all the way to the outer ankle. This vein is termed saphena minor, or externa.\n\nThe little saphena, having got near the integuments in its course downward, gives out a branch which runs backward, and communicates with the great saphena about the middle of the backside of the thigh.\n\nImmediately above and below the ham, this vein sends out other branches, which likewise communicate with the saphena major, and, having run down about one third part of the backside of the tibia, it sends off another branch, which is afterwards re-united to the trunk.\n\nAbout the beginning of the tendo-achillis, the little saphena runs outward in the integuments, toward the outer ankles, where it terminates in cutaneous ramifications sent to every side.\n\nThe crural vein, having detached the little saphena, runs down between the biceps and the other flexors of the leg, closely accompanied by the crural artery, between which and the inner condyle of the os femoris it is situated.\n\nA little above the ham, it takes the name of vena poplitea; and as it runs down betwixt the two condyles, it gives branches to the flexor muscles, to the lower and posterior parts of both vasti, and to the fat which lies above the interstices of the two condyles.\n\nIt likewise gives off several other branches, one of which runs up laterally between the outer condyle and the biceps, and then turning forward, is ramified in the same manner with the artery.\n\nThe vena poplitea runs down immediately behind the muscle of the same name, at the lower part of which it sends off several ramifications to each side, which divide and unite again in different ways; and afterwards it loses its name, being divided into three considerable branches, called tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, and peronea.\n\nThe anterior tibial vein, having distributed some small branches from its very beginning to the muscles behind the heads of the two bones of the leg, perforates the interosseous ligament from behind, forward, and runs between the superior portions of the musculus tibialis anticus, and extensor digitorum communis.\n\nAs soon as it pierces the interosseous ligament, it distributes small superficial branches to the head of the tibia and fibula, which run to the joint of the knee, and communicate with the lateral branches of the vena poplitea.\n\nAfterwards it divides into two or three branches, which run down together on the foreside of the interosseous ligament in company with the anterior tibial artery, which they surround at different distances, by small communicating circles.\n\nThese branches having reached the lower extremity of the leg, unite in one, which afterwards divides into several, the ramifications of which are distributed to the foot.\n\nThe posterior tibial vein gives off, from its beginning, a branch toward the inside, which is distributed to the gastrocnemii and soleus. This vein is named suralis.\n\nAfterwards the posterior tibialis runs down between the soleus and tibialis posterior, giving branches to each of them. It is divided in the same manner as the tibialis anterior, into two or three branches, which, as they run, surround the corresponding artery, by small communicating circles formed at different distances.\n\nIt continues this course in company with the artery as low as the outer ankle, furnishing the musculus tibialis posterior, and the long flexors of the toes.\n\nLastly, it passes on the inside of the os calcis, under the sole of the foot, where it forms the vena plantares, by dividing into several transverse arches, which communicate with each other and with the saphena, and send ramifications to the toes.\n\nThe vena peronea is likewise double, and sometimes triple. It runs down on the inside of the fibula, which it likewise surrounds at different distances, by communicating branches, after the manner of the tibialis posterior.\n\nIt runs down as low as the outer ankle, communicating several times with the tibialis posterior, and sending ramifications to the neighbouring portions of the musculi peronei, and long flexors of the toes.\n\nThe vena porta is a large vein, the trunk of which is situated chiefly between the eminencies on the lower or concave side of the liver.\n\nIt may be considered as made up of two large veins, joined almost endwise by their trunks, from each of which the branches and ramifications go out in opposite directions. One of these trunks adheres to the liver, and is ramified in that viscous, its branches accompanying the whole distribution of the hepatic artery.\n\nThe other trunk is without the liver, and sends its branches to the viscera, supplied by the rest of the arteria celiaca, and by the two mesenteriae, that is, to the stomach, intestines, pancreas, spleen, mesentery, and omentum.\n\nThe first portion of this vein may be termed vena\nportae hepatica, superior or minor, the trunk of which is commonly known by the name of sinus vene portae. The other portion may be called vena portae ventralis, inferior or major.\n\nThe large trunk of the vena portae inferior, or ventralis, is situated under the lower or concave side of the liver, and joined by an anastomosis to the sinus of the vena portae hepatica, between the middle and right extremity of that sinus. From thence it runs down a little obliquely from right to left, behind or under the trunk of the arteria hepatica, bending behind the beginning of the duodenum, and under the head of the pancreas.\n\nHaving reached to the head of the pancreas, this trunk loses the general name of vena portae, and terminates in three large principal branches, which are distributed, by numerous ramifications, to the viscera already named. The first branch is termed vena mesafarica, or mesafarica major; the second, splenica; and the third, haemorrhoidalis interna, or mesafarica minor.\n\nThe vena mesafarica major appears to be a continuation of the trunk of the vena portae inferior. The splenica is a capital branch of that trunk; and the haemorrhoidalis interna has sometimes a common origin with the splenica.\n\nThe inferior vena portae, before the formation of these three branches, sends off from the trunk several small rami, which are commonly the venae cysticae, hepatica minor, pylorica, duodenalis, and sometimes the gallica recta, and coronaria ventriculi.\n\nAll these small veins sometimes arise separately; and, in other subjects, some of them go out by small common trunks.\n\nThe cystic veins run along the vesicula fellea, from its neck to the bottom; and as they are often no more than two in number, they are called cystica gemellae.\n\nThe small hepatic vein is commonly a branch of one of the cystic.\n\nThe vena pylorica arises from the great trunk, almost opposite to the origin of the cystic; and sometimes is only a branch of the right gallica. It passes over the pylorus to the short arch of the stomach, where it is joined, by anastomosis, with the coronaria ventriculi.\n\nThe duodenal vein, commonly called vena intestinalis, goes out from the great trunk near the cystic, and sometimes from the small common trunk of these veins. It is distributed chiefly to the intestinum duodenum, and sends likewise some rami to the pancreas.\n\nThe inferior vena portae, having given off the splenica, changes its name to that of mesafarica, or mesafarica major; which often appears to be rather a continuation of the trunk, than of one of the great branches.\n\nIt bends toward the superior mesenteric artery, sending off two veins, and afterwards running up over that artery, it accompanies it in those portions of the mesentery and mesocolon which belong to the small intestine, the cecum, and right portion of the colon.\n\nThe first particular branch from this trunk is called vena colica. It goes out from the anterior part of the trunk, before it joins the artery, and runs directly to the middle of the colon, where it divides to the right and left, and forms arches. On the left hand, it communicates with the superior or ascending branch of the haemorrhoidalis; and on the right, with the second branch of the mesafarica.\n\nThis second branch is a little under the first, or colica anterior, and something more towards the right hand. It may be named gastro-colica, and is soon divided into two branches, one superior, the other inferior.\n\nThe superior branch of the vena gastro-colica sends small veins to the head of the pancreas, and forms the vena gallica, or gastro-epiploica dextra, which goes from the pylorus to the great curvature of the stomach, and communicates with the gallica sinistra. In its passage it supplies the stomach and omentum, and communicates with the pyloric, coronaria ventriculi, &c.\n\nThe inferior branch of the vena gastro-colica, which may be called colica dextra, goes to the right portion of the colon; and from thence to the upper part of that intestine, where it is divided archwise, and communicates with the right branch of the colica anterior, and with a branch of the vena c\u00e6calis.\n\nThe trunk of the great mesafaric vein sends out sometimes, opposite to the gallica, a particular branch to the omentum, called epiploica dextra. But almost immediately before it ascends over the meleteric artery, it produces two large branches very near each other, which pass behind and under the artery, being distributed to the jejunum and part of the ilium by numerous ramifications.\n\nAfterwards the trunk of the mesafaric passes over the superior meleteric artery, to which it adheres very closely, and from the convex side of its arch sends out several branches, almost in the same manner with the artery.\n\nFrom the concave side of the mesafaric vein, a little below the origin of the second branch, from the convex side, arises a branch, called vena c\u00e6calis, which runs to the beginning of the colon, crossing one of the branches of the superior meleteric artery.\n\nThis c\u00e6cal vein divides by two arches, the uppermost of which communicates with the lower branch of the vena gastro-colica; the other, after having sent ramifications to the intestinum c\u00e6cum and appendicula vermiciformis, communicates below with the extremity of the great mesafaric vein.\n\nThe splenic vein is one of the three great branches of the vena portae. It runs transversely from the right to the left, first under the duodenum, and then along the lower side of the pancreas.\n\nIn this course it gives off several veins, viz., the vena coronaria ventriculi, pancreatic\u00e6, gallica, or gastro-epiploica sinistra, and epiploica sinistra. It likewise often gives origin to the haemorrhoidalis interna, the third capital branch of the vena portae.\n\nIt terminates afterwards by a winding course, being divided into several branches that go to the spleen; one of which produces the small veins called, by the ancients, vasa brevia.\n\nThe coronaria ventriculi runs along the small arch of that viscus toward the pylorus, where it joins and becomes continuous with the vena pylorica. In its passage, it gives several rami to the sides of the stomach.\n\nThe vena pancratic\u00e6 are several small branches\nfent by the splenica to the pancreas, along its lower side.\n\nThe left gastric, or gastro-epiploic vein, goes out from the splenica, at the left extremity of the pancreas; from whence it runs to the great extremity of the stomach, and along the great arch, till it meets the galtrica dextra, which is continuous with the sinistra.\n\nIn its passage, it gives several branches to both sides of the stomach, which are distributed by numerous ramifications, form many arcades, and communicate with the branches of the coronaria ventriculi.\n\nAt a small distance from its origin, this galtric vein sends out a branch, which is distributed to the omentum; and on this account it has been called gastro-epiploica.\n\nThe vena epiploica sinistra arises at the small extremity of the pancreas, and is ramified on the omentum, all the way to the colon, where it communicates with the haemorrhoidalis interna.\n\nLastly, the vena splenica reaches the fissure of the spleen, which it enters through its whole length by several branches. It is from the most posterior of these branches that the veins are sent off to the great extremity of the stomach, formerly known by the name of va/a brevis, which communicate with the coronaria ventriculi and gastrica sinistra.","sp":281,"ep":292},{"h":"PART VI","t":"Of such Parts of the Body as could not properly be described under any of the former general Divisions.\n\nSECT.

From thence it runs obliquely downward under the inner condyle of the os femoris; it is a flat and pretty thick fleshy body, increasing gradually in breadth, till it is fixed in the back-side of the head of the tibia, all the way to the oblique line or impression observable on that side.\n\nUses of the Muscles which move the Bones of the Leg on the Os Femoris.\n\nThe two vasti and crureus ought to be looked upon as a true triceps, the uses of which, in relation to the bones, are only to extend the tibia on the os femoris, and the os femoris on the tibia. The extension of the tibia on the os femoris happens chiefly when we sit or lie, and that of the os femoris on the tibia when we stand or walk. All the three muscles move the patella uniformly in the direction of the os femoris, on the pulley at the lower extremity of that bone.\n\nThe insertion of both the vasti immediately in the head of the tibia, prevents the patella from being luxated laterally on some occasions, in which the muscles may act with more force on one side than on the other, or remain without action, in which case the patella is loose and floating.\n\nThe rectus anterior, by its insertion in the patella, is a congener to the last three muscles, and serves to extend the leg. By its insertion in the os ilium, it bends the thigh, and assists the psoas, iliacus, and poctineus, whether the leg be extended or bent. It likewise moves the pelvis forward on the os femoris, and hinders it from falling back when we sit.\n\nThe sartorius performs the rotation of the thigh from before outward, whether extended or bent; being an antagonist to the musculus fasciae latae, and a congener to the quadrigenini.\n\nIt likewise bends the thigh, or raises it forward; it moves the pelvis forward on the femoris; and when the pelvis rests on the two tuberosities of the ilium in sitting, it keeps it in that situation.\n\nLastly, it bends the leg, whether it performs the rotation of the thigh at the same time or not.\n\nThe gracilis internus bends the leg much in the same manner with the sartorius, which it assists in this function, but not in that of turning the leg.\n\nIt may likewise assist the triceps in the adduction of the thigh, which it performs with much more facility than it begins the flexion of the leg without the rotation of the thigh.\nThe semi-nervosus bends the leg, and may likewise bend the thigh on the leg. By its insertion in the tuberosity of the ischium, it likewise extends the thigh on the pelvis, and carries it backward; and may also extend the pelvis on the thigh, when it has been inclined forward with the rest of the trunk; and consequently prevent its being carried too far along with the trunk, when we stoop forward, either standing or sitting.\n\nThe semi-membranosus has the same uses with the semi-nervosus. It bends the leg on the thigh, and the thigh on the leg; it extends the thigh on the pelvis, and the pelvis on the thigh, and sustains the pelvis when it is inclined forward.\n\nThe two portions of the biceps bend the leg on the thigh, and the thigh on the leg. The superior portion likewise extends the thigh on the pelvis, and the pelvis on the thigh. These four uses in general are common to this muscle with the semi-membranosus, and in some measure with the semi-tendinosus.\n\nThe particular use of the biceps, and which seems to belong more to the short portion than to the other, is to perform the rotation of the leg when bent, by which motion the toes are turned outward, and the heel inward.\n\nThe popliteus performs the rotation of the leg when bent, in a direction contrary to that of the biceps. The biceps turns the leg from before outward; the popliteus from before inward.\n\n**Sect. XI. The Muscles which move the Tarsus on the Leg.**\n\n**Tibialis Anticus.**\n\nThis is a long muscle, fleshy at the upper part, and tendinous at the lower, situated on the fore-side of the leg, between the tibia and the extensor digitorum longus.\n\nIt is fixed above, by fleshy fibres, in the upper third part of the external labium of the crista tibiae, and of the inside of the aponeurosis tibialis, or of that ligamentary expansion which goes between the crista tibiae and the anterior angle of the fibula. It is likewise fixed obliquely in the upper two thirds of the outside of the tibia, or that next the fibula.\n\nFrom thence it runs down and ends in a tendon, which first passes through a ring of the common annular ligament, and then through another separate ring situated lower down. Afterwards the tendon is fixed, partly in the upper and inner part of the os cuboides, and partly in the inside of the first bone of the metatarsus.\n\n**Peronaeus Medius vulgo Peronaeus Anticus.**\n\nThis is a long muscle, situated anteriorly on the middle part of the fibula.\n\nIt is fixed above, by fleshy fibres, to more than the middle third part of the anterior or outside of the fibula, and to the neighbouring part of the aponeurosis tibialis.\n\nIt is likewise fixed to a production from the inside of that aponeurosis which runs to the upper part of the ti-\n\nbia, and there serves for a middle septum between this muscle and the extensor digitorum longus.\n\nFrom thence it runs down and forms a tendon, which going in the direction of the oblique line on the fibula, passes behind the external malleolus, and then through an annular ligament common to it and to the peronaeus maximus, and is afterwards inserted in the tuberosity at the basis of the fifth metatarsal bone, sending off a small tendon to the first phalanx of the little toe.\n\n**Peronaeus Minimus.**\n\nThis is a small muscle, commonly thought to be a portion of the extensor digitorum longus, though it is easily separable from it.\n\nIt is fixed, by fleshy fibres, in the lower half of the inside of the fibula, between two oblique bony lines, on one side of the lower part of the extensor digitorum longus, to which muscle it is simply contiguous.\n\nFrom thence it runs down contracting in breadth, and passes with the extensor longus, through the common annular ligament, forming a flat tendon, which soon separates from those of the extensor, and is inserted near the basis of the fifth metatarsal bone.\n\n**Gastrocnemii.**\n\nThese are two thick, pretty broad, and oblong muscles, situated laterally with respect to each other, in the same plane, under the poples, and forming a great part of what is called the calf of the leg. That which lies next the tibia is called internus, and that next the fibula, externus; and because they form, as it were, the belly of the leg, they have been termed in Greek gastrocnemii.\n\nEach muscle is fixed above, by a flat tendon, to the posterior part of the lower extremity of the os femoris, behind the lateral tuberosity of each condyle, adhering closely to the posterior ligaments of the joint of the knee.\n\nFrom thence they run down, each forming a large and pretty broad fleshy body, irregularly oval.\n\nAbout the middle of the leg, they end in a strong, broad, common tendon, which contracts a little in breadth as it descends, and is inserted in the posterior extremity of the os calcis, together with the tendon of the soleus.\n\n**Soleus.**\n\nThis is a large, fleshy, flat muscle, nearly of an oval figure, and thicker in the middle than at the edges. It is situated on the back-side of the leg, lower down than the gastrocnemii, by which it is covered; and these three muscles form the calf of the leg.\n\nIt is fixed above, partly to the tibia, and partly to the fibula.\n\nAfterwards leaving these two bones, it ends in a broad strong tendon, which, together with that of the gastrocnemii, forms what is called tendo Achillis. This strong tendon contracts a little in its passage to the os calcis, and then expanding a little, it is inserted obliquely in the back-side of that bone, all the way to the tuberosity.\nTIBIALIS GRACILIS vulgo PLANTARIS.\n\nThis is a small pyriform muscle, situated obliquely in the ham below the external condyle of the os femoris, between the popliteus and gastrocnemius externus; and its tendon, which is long, flat, and very small, runs down on the side of the gastrocnemius internus, all the way to the heel.\n\nThe fleshy body, which is only about two inches in length, and one in breadth, is fixed, by a short flat tendon, above the outer edge of the exterior condyle of the os femoris, on one side of the gastrocnemius externus. From thence the fleshy body runs obliquely over the edge of the popliteus, and terminates in a very small, long, flat tendon.\n\nThis tendon runs between the body of the gastrocnemius externus and soleus, all the way to the inner edge of the upper part of the tendo Achillis; and from thence continuing its course downward, it joins this tendon, and is inserted, together with it, in the outside of the posterior part of the os calcis, without communicating with the aponeurosis plantaris.","sp":250,"ep":252},{"h":"PROBLEM VII","t":"To find the greatest common measure of two numbers; that is, the greatest number that can divide them both without a remainder.\n\nRule: First divide the greater number by the lesser, and if there is no remainder, the lesser number is the greatest common divisor required.

Thus, in the last example, \\(a - b\\) measures the divisor \\(a^2 - b^2\\), and the remainder \\(2ab + 2b^2\\); it must therefore likewise measure their sum \\(a^2 - 2ab + b^2\\).

And in division the quotient may be continued to any degree of exactness you please, by adding cyphers to the dividend. The ground of these operations is easily understood from the general rules for adding, multiplying, and dividing fractions.\n\nCHAP. VI. Of the Involution of Quantities.\n\nThe products arising from the continual multiplication of the same quantity were called (in Chap. III.) the powers of that quantity. Thus, \\(a, a^2, a^3, \\text{ &c.}\\) are the powers of \\(a\\); and \\(a^2, a^3, b^2, a^5, b^3, \\text{ &c.}\\) are the powers of \\(ab\\). In the same chapter, the rule for the multiplication of powers of the same quantity is, \"To add the exponents, and make their sum the exponent of the product.\" Thus \\(a^4 \\times a^3 = a^7\\); and \\(a^5 b^3 \\times a^6 b^2 = a^9 b^5\\). In Chap. IV. you have the rule for dividing powers of the same quantity, which is \"To subtract the exponents, and make the difference the exponent of the quotient.\"\n\nThus, \\(\\frac{a^6}{a^2} = a^{6-2} = a^4\\); and \\(\\frac{a^5 b^3}{a^6 b} = a^{5-6} b^{3-1} = ab^2\\).\n\nIf you divide a lesser power by a greater, the exponent of the quotient must, by this rule, be negative.\n\nThus,\nThus, \\( \\frac{a^4}{a^5} = a^{4-5} = a^{-1} \\). But, \\( \\frac{a^4}{a^5} = \\frac{1}{a^2} \\); and hence \\( \\frac{1}{a^3} \\) is expressed also by \\( a^3 \\) with a negative exponent.\n\nIt is also obvious, that \\( \\frac{a}{a} = a^{1-1} = a^0 \\); but \\( \\frac{a}{a} = 1 \\), and therefore \\( a^0 = 1 \\). After the same manner \\( \\frac{1}{a} = a^0 = a^0 - 1 = a^{-1} \\); \\( \\frac{1}{a^2} = a^0 - 2 = a^{-2} \\); \\( \\frac{1}{a^3} = a^0 - 3 = a^{-3} \\); so that the quantities \\( a, 1, \\frac{1}{a}, \\frac{1}{a^2}, \\frac{1}{a^3}, \\ldots \\) may be expressed thus, \\( a^0, a^0, a^{-1}, a^{-2}, a^{-3}, \\ldots \\). Those are called the negative powers of \\( a \\) which have negative exponents; but they are at the same time positive powers of \\( \\frac{1}{a} \\) or \\( a^{-1} \\).\n\nNegative powers (as well as positive) are multiplied by adding, and divided by subtracting their exponents.\n\nThus the product of \\( a^{-1} \\) (or \\( \\frac{1}{a^2} \\)) multiplied by \\( a^{-3} \\) (or \\( \\frac{1}{a^3} \\)) is \\( a^{-1-3} = a^{-4} \\) (or \\( \\frac{1}{a^4} \\)); also \\( a^{-6} \\times a^4 = a^{-6+4} = a^{-2} \\) (or \\( \\frac{1}{a^2} \\)); and \\( a^{-3} \\times a^3 = a^0 = 1 \\). And, in general, any positive power of a multiplied by a negative power of \\( a \\) of an equal exponent gives unit for the product; for the positive and negative destroy each other, and the product gives \\( a^0 \\), which is equal to unit.\n\nLikewise \\( \\frac{a^{-5}}{a^{-4}} = a^{-5+2} = a^{-3} = \\frac{1}{a^3} \\); and \\( \\frac{a^{-3}}{a^{-5}} = a^{-3+5} = a^2 \\). But also, \\( \\frac{a^{-5}}{a^{-5}} = \\frac{a^{-5}}{a^{-5}} \\times a^{-3} = \\frac{1}{a^{-3}} \\); therefore \\( \\frac{1}{a^{-3}} = a^3 \\): And, in general, \"Any quantity placed in the denominator of a fraction may be transposed to the numerator, if the sign of its exponent be changed.\" Thus \\( \\frac{1}{a^3} = a^{-3} \\), and \\( \\frac{1}{a^{-3}} = a^3 \\).\n\nThe quantity \\( a^m \\) expresses any power of \\( a \\) in general, the exponent (\\( m \\)) being undetermined; and \\( a^{-m} \\) expresses \\( \\frac{1}{a^m} \\), or a negative power of \\( a \\) of an equal exponent; and \\( a^m \\times a^{-m} = a^{m-m} = a^0 = 1 \\) is their product. \\( a^n \\) expresses any other power of \\( a \\); \\( a^m \\times a^n = a^{m+n} \\) is the product of the powers \\( a^m \\) and \\( a^n \\), and \\( a^{m-n} \\) is their quotient.\n\nTo raise any simple quantity to its second, third, or fourth power, is to add its exponent twice, thrice, or four times to itself; therefore the second power of any quantity is had by doubling its exponent, and the third by trebling its exponent; and, in general, the power expressed by \\( m \\) of any quantity is had by multiplying the exponent by \\( m \\), as is obvious from the multiplication of powers. Thus the second power or square of \\( a \\) is\n\n\\[\na^2 \\times a^2 = a^4; \\text{ its third power or cube is } a^3 \\times a^3 = a^6; \\text{ and the } n^{th} \\text{ power of } a \\text{ is } a^n \\times a^n = a^{2n}. \\]\n\nAlso, the square of \\( a^4 \\) is \\( a^4 \\times a^4 = a^8 \\); the cube of \\( a^4 \\) is \\( a^4 \\times a^4 = a^{12} \\); and the \\( m^{th} \\) power of \\( a^4 \\) is \\( a^4 \\times a^m \\). The square of \\( a b c \\) is \\( a^2 b^2 c^2 \\), the cube is \\( a^3 b^3 c^3 \\), the \\( m^{th} \\) power \\( a^m b^m c^m \\).\n\nThe raising of quantities to any power is called involution, and any simple quantity is involved by multiplying the exponent by that of the power required, as in the preceding examples.\n\nThe coefficient must also be raised to the same power by a continual multiplication of itself by itself, as often as unit is contained in the exponent of the power required. Thus the cube of \\( 3 a b \\) is \\( 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times a^3 b^3 = 27 a^3 b^3 \\).\n\nAs to the signs, When the quantity to be involved is positive, it is obvious that all its powers must be positive. And, when the quantity to be involved is negative, yet all its powers whose exponents are even numbers, must be positive; for any number of multiplications of a negative, if the number be even, gives a positive; since \\( -x = + \\), therefore \\( -x \\times -x \\times -x = +x \\times +x = + \\); and \\( -x \\times -x \\times -x \\times -x = +x \\times +x = + \\).\n\nThe power then only can be negative when its exponent is an odd number, though the quantity to be involved be negative. The powers of \\( -a \\) are \\( -a, +a^2, -a^3, +a^4, -a^5, \\ldots \\). Those whose exponents are 2, 4, 6, etc., are positive; but those whose exponents are 1, 3, 5, etc., are negative.\n\nThe involution of compound quantities is a more difficult operation. The powers of any binomial \\( a + b \\) are found by a continual multiplication of it by itself, as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na + b &= \\text{Root}, \\\\\n\\times a + b & \\\\\na^2 + ab & \\\\\n+ ab + b^2 & \\\\\na^3 + 2ab + b^2 &= \\text{the square or 2d. power}, \\\\\n\\times a + b & \\\\\na^3 + 2a^2b + ab^2 & \\\\\n+ a^2b + 2ab^2 + b^3 & \\\\\na^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3 &= \\text{cube or 3d power, etc.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nIf the powers of \\( a - b \\) are required, they will be found the same as the preceding, only the terms in which the exponent of \\( b \\) is an odd number, will be found negative; \"because an odd number of multiplications of a negative produces a negative.\" Thus, the cube of \\( a - b \\) will be found to be \\( a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3 \\). Where the 2d and 4th terms are negative, the exponent of \\( b \\) being an odd number in these terms. In general, \"The terms of any power of \\( a - b \\) are positive and negative by turns.\"\n\nIt is to be observed, That \"in the first term of any power of \\( a - b \\), the quantity \\( a \\) has the exponent of the power required; that in the following terms, the exponents of \\( a \\) decrease gradually by the same differ-\nence (viz: unit), and that in the last terms it is never found. The powers of \\( b \\) are in the contrary order; it is not found in the first term, but its exponent in the second term is unit, in the third term its exponent is 2; and thus its exponent increases, till in the last term it becomes equal to the exponent of the power required.\"\n\nAs the exponents of \\( a \\) thus decrease, and at the same time those of \\( b \\) increase, \"the sum of their exponents is always the same, and is equal to the exponent of the power required.\" Thus, in the 6th power of \\( a + b \\), viz. \\( a^6 + 6a^5b + 15a^4b^2 + 20a^3b^3 + 15a^2b^4 + 6ab^5 + b^6 \\), the exponents of \\( a \\) decrease in this order, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0; and those of \\( b \\) increase in the contrary order, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And the sum of their exponents in any term is always 6.\n\nTo find the coefficient of any term, the coefficient of the preceding term being known, you are to \"divide the coefficient of the preceding term by the exponent of \\( b \\) in the given term, and to multiply the quotient by the exponent of \\( a \\) in the same term, increased by unit.\" Thus to find the coefficients of the terms of the 6th power of \\( a + b \\), you find the terms are \\( a^6, a^5b, a^4b^2, a^3b^3, a^2b^4, ab^5, b^6 \\); and you know the coefficient of the first term is unit; therefore, according to the rule, the coefficient of the second term will be \\( \\frac{1}{1} \\times \\frac{5}{5+1} = 6 \\); that of the third term will be \\( \\frac{6}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{4+1} = 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\); that of the fourth term will be \\( \\frac{15}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{3+1} = 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\); and those of the following will be 15, 6, 1, agreeable to the preceding table.\n\nIn general, if \\( a + b \\) is to be raised to any power \\( m \\), the terms, without their coefficients will be \\( a^m, a^{m-1}b, a^{m-2}b^2, a^{m-3}b^3, a^{m-4}b^4, \\ldots \\), &c., continued till the exponent of \\( b \\) becomes equal to \\( m \\).\n\nThe coefficients of the respective terms, according to the last rule, will be\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1, m, m \\times \\frac{m-1}{2}, m \\times \\frac{m-1}{2}, \\times \\frac{m-2}{3}, m \\times \\frac{m-1}{2} \\times \\frac{m-2}{3} \\times \\frac{m-3}{4}, \\\\\n\\times \\frac{m-2}{3} \\times \\frac{m-3}{4}, m \\times \\frac{m-1}{2} \\times \\frac{m-2}{3} \\times \\frac{m-3}{4} \\times \\frac{m-4}{5}, \\\\\n\\text{&c.; continued until you have one coefficient more than there are units in } m.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nIt follows therefore by these last rules, that \\( a + b^m = a^m + m a^{m-1}b + m \\times \\frac{m-1}{2} \\times a^{m-2}b^2 + m \\times \\frac{m-1}{2} \\times \\frac{m-2}{3} \\times a^{m-3}b^3 + m \\times \\frac{m-1}{2} \\times \\frac{m-2}{3} \\times \\frac{m-3}{4} \\times a^{m-4}b^4 + \\text{&c.} \\)\n\nwhich is the general theorem for raising a quantity consisting of two terms to any power \\( m \\).\n\nIf a quantity consisting of three or more terms is to be involved, \"you may distinguish it into two parts, considering it as a binomial, and raise it to any power by the preceding rules; and then, by the same rules, you may substitute, instead of the powers of these compound parts, their values.\" Thus,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na + b + c^2 &= a + b + c^2 = a + b^2 + 2c \\times a + b + c^2 \\\\\n&= a^2 + 2a + b^2 + 2ac + 2bc + c^2.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nIn these examples, \\( a + b + c \\) is considered as composed of the compound part \\( a + b \\) and the simple part \\( c \\); and then the powers of \\( a + b \\) are formed by the preceding rules, and substituted for \\( a + b^3 \\) and \\( a + b^2 \\).\n\n**Chap. VII. Of Evolution.**\n\nThe reverse of involution, or the resolving of powers into their roots, is called evolution. The roots of single quantities are easily extracted \"by dividing their exponents by the number that denominates the root required.\" Thus, the square root of \\( a^8 \\) is \\( a^{\\frac{8}{2}} = a^4 \\); and the square root of \\( a^6b^3c^2 \\) is \\( a^{\\frac{6}{2}}b^{\\frac{3}{2}}c = a^3b^{\\frac{3}{2}}c \\). The cube root of \\( a^6b^3 \\) is \\( a^{\\frac{6}{3}}b^{\\frac{3}{3}} = a^2b \\); and the cube root of \\( x^3y^2z^4 \\) is \\( x^{\\frac{3}{3}}y^{\\frac{2}{3}}z^{\\frac{4}{3}} \\).\n\nThe ground of this rule is obvious from the rule for involution. The powers of any root are found by multiplying its exponent by the index that denominates the power; and therefore, when any power is given, the root must be found by dividing the exponent of the given power by the number that denominates the kind of root that is required.\n\nIt appears, from what was said of involution, that any power that has a positive sign may have either a positive or negative root, if the root is denominated by any even number.\" Thus the square-root of \\( +a^2 \\) may be \\( +a \\) or \\( -a \\), because \\( +a \\times +a = -a \\times -a \\) gives \\( +a^2 \\) for the product.\n\nBut if a power have a negative sign, \"no root of it denominated by an even number can be assigned,\" since there is no quantity that multiplied into itself an even number of times can give a negative product. Thus the square root of \\( -a^2 \\) cannot be assigned, and is what we call an impossible or imaginary quantity.\n\nBut if the root to be extracted is denominated by an odd number, then shall \"the sign of the root be the same as the sign of the given number whose root is required.\" Thus the cube root of \\( -a^3 \\) is \\( -a \\), and the cube root of \\( -a^6b^3 \\) is \\( -a^2b \\).\n\nIf the number that denominates the root required is a divisor of the exponent of the given power, then shall the root be only a lower power of the same quantity. As the cube root of \\( a^6 \\) is \\( a^2 \\), the number 3 that denominates the cube root being a divisor of 12.\n\nBut if the number that denominates what sort of root is required is not a divisor of the exponent of the given power, \"then the root required shall have a fraction for its exponent.\" Thus the square root of \\( a^3 \\) is \\( a^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\); the cube root of \\( a^5 \\) is \\( a^{\\frac{5}{3}} \\), and the square root of \\( a \\) itself is \\( a^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\).\n\nThese powers that have fractional exponents are called imperfect powers or surds; and are otherwise expressed by placing the given power within the radical sign \\( \\sqrt{} \\), and placing above the radical sign the number that denominates what kind of root is required. Thus \\( \\sqrt[3]{a^2} = a^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\), \\( \\sqrt[3]{a^5} = a^{\\frac{5}{3}} \\), and \\( \\sqrt[n]{a^m} = a^{\\frac{m}{n}} \\).\n\nIn numbers the square root of 2 is expressed by \\( \\sqrt{2} \\), and the cube root of 4 by \\( \\sqrt[3]{4} \\).\nThe square root of any compound quantity, as $a^2 + 2ab + b^2$, is discovered after this manner. \"First,\" take care to dispose the terms according to the dimensions of the alphabet, as in division; then find the square root of the first term $a$, which gives $a$ for the first member of the root. Then subtract its square from the proposed quantity, and divide the first term of the remainder $(2ab + b^2)$ by the double of that member, viz., $2a$, and the quotient $b$ is the second member of the root. Add this second member to the double of the first, and multiply their sum $(2a + b)$ by the second member $b$, and subtract the product $(2ab + b^2)$ from the foreaid remainder $(2ab + b^2)$, and if nothing remains, then the square root is obtained;\" and in this example it is found to be $a + b$.\n\nThe manner of the operation is thus,\n\n$$\\begin{array}{c}\na^2 + 2ab + b^2 \\\\\n\\hline\na^2 \\\\\n\\hline\n2a + b \\quad 2ab + b^2 \\\\\n\\hline\n2ab + b^2 \\\\\n\\end{array}$$\n\n\"But if there had been a remainder, you must have divided it by the double of the sum of the two parts already found, and the quotient would have given the third member of the root.\"\n\nThus, if the quantity proposed had been $a^2 + 2ab + 2ac + b^2 + 2bc + c^2$, after proceeding as above, you would have found the remainder $2ac + 2bc + c^2$, which divided by $2a + 2b$ gives $c$ to be annexed to $a + b$ as the 3d member of the root. Then adding $c$ to $2a + 2b$, and multiplying their sum $2a + 2b + c$ by $c$, subtract the product $2ac + 2bc + c^2$ from the foreaid remainder; and since nothing now remains, you conclude that $a + b + c$ is the square root required.\n\nThe square root of any number is found out after the same manner. If it is a number under 100, its nearest square root is found by the following table; by which also its cube root is found if it be under 1000, and is biquadrate if it be under 10000.\n\n| The root | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |\n|----------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Square   | 1 | 4 | 9 | 25| 36| 49| 64| 81|\n| Cube     | 1 | 8 | 27| 64|125|216|343|512|729|\n| Biquad.  | 1 |16|81|256|625|1296|2401|4096|6561|\n\nBut if it is a number above 100, then its square root will consist of two or more figures, which must be found by different operations by the following\n\n**Rule.**\n\n\"To find the square root of any number, place a point above the number that is in the place of units, pass the place of tens, and place again a point over that of hundreds, and go on towards the left hand placing a point over every 2d figure; and by these points the number will be distinguished into as many parts as there are figures in the root. Then find the square root of the first part, and it will give the first figure of the root; subtract its square from that part, and annex the second part of the given number to the remainder. Then divide this new number (neglecting its last figure) by the double of the first figure of the root, annex the quotient to that double, and multiply the number thence arising by the said quotient, and if the product is less than your dividend, or equal to it, that quotient shall be the second figure of the root. But if the product is greater than the dividend, you must take a less number for the second figure of the root than that quotient.\" Much after the same manner may the other figures of the quotient be found, if there are more points than two placed over the given number.\n\nTo find the square root of 99856, first point it thus, 99856; then find the square root of 9 to be 3, which therefore is the first figure of the root; subtract 9, the square of 3, from 9, and to the remainder annex the second part 98, and divide (neglecting the last figure 8) by the double of 3, or 6, and place the quotient after 6, and then multiply 61 by 1, and subtract the product 61 from 98. Then to the remainder (37) annex the last part of the proposed number (56), and dividing 3756 (neglecting the last figure 6) by the double of 31, that is by 62, place the quotient after, and multiplying 626 by the quotient 6, you will find the product to be 3756, which subtracted from the dividend, and leaving no remainder, the exact root must be 316.\n\n**Example.**\n\n$$\\begin{array}{c}\n99856 \\\\\n-9 \\\\\n\\hline\n6198 \\\\\n\\times 61 \\\\\n\\hline\n626 \\quad 3756 \\\\\n\\times 6 \\quad 3756 \\\\\n\\end{array}$$\n\nIn general, to extract any root out of any given quantity, \"First range that quantity according to the dimensions of its letters, and extract the said root out of the first term, and that shall be the first member of the root required. Then raise this root to a dimension lower by unit than the number that denominates the root required, and multiply the power that arises by that number itself; divide the second term of the given quantity by the product, and the quotient shall give the second member of the root required.\"\n\nThus to extract the root of the 5th power out of $a^5 + 5a^4b + 10a^3b^2 + 10a^2b^3 + 5ab^4 + b^5$, I find, that the root of the 5th power out of $a^5$ gives $a$, which I raise to the 4th power, and multiplying by 5, the product is $5a^4$; then dividing the second term of the given quantity $5a^4b$ by $5a^4$, I find $b$ to be the second member; and raising $a + b$ to the 5th power, and subtracting it, there being no remainder, I conclude that $a + b$ is the root required. If the root has three members, the third is found after the same manner from the first two considered as one member, as the second member was found from the first, which may be easily understood from what was said of extracting the square root.\nIn extracting roots it will often happen that the exact root cannot be found in finite terms; thus the square root of \\(a^2 + x^2\\) is found to be\n\n\\[\na + \\frac{x^2}{2a} - \\frac{x^4}{8a^3} + \\frac{x^6}{16a^5} - \\frac{5x^8}{128a^7} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nThe operation is thus;\n\n\\[\na^2 + x^2 \\left(a + \\frac{x^2}{2a} - \\frac{x^4}{8a^3} + \\frac{x^6}{16a^5} - \\ldots\\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= a^2 + \\frac{x^2}{2a} + \\frac{x^4}{4a^2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= a^2 + \\frac{x^2}{2a} - \\frac{x^4}{8a^3} + \\frac{x^6}{16a^5} - \\frac{5x^8}{128a^7} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nThe general theorem which we gave for the involution of binomials will serve also for their evolution; because to extract any root of a given quantity is the same thing as to raise that quantity to a power whose exponent is a fraction that has its denominator equal to the number that expresses what kind of root is to be extracted. Thus, to extract the square root of \\(a + b\\) is to raise \\(a + b\\) to a power whose exponent is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nThe roots of numbers are to be extracted as those of algebraic quantities. Place a point over the units, and then place points over every third, fourth, or fifth figure towards the left hand, according as it is the root of the cube, of the 4th or 5th power that is required; and, if there be any decimals annexed to the number, point them after the same manner, proceeding from the place of units towards the right-hand. By this means the number will be divided into so many periods as there are figures in the root required. Then inquire which is the greatest cube, biquadrate, or 5th power in the first period, and the root of that power will give the first figure of the root required. Subtract the greatest cube, biquadrate, or 5th power, from the first period, and to the remainder annex the first figure of your second period, which shall give your dividend.\n\nRaise the first figure already found to a power less by unit than the power whose root is sought, that is, to the 2d, 3d, or 4th power, according as it is the cube root, the root of the 4th, or the root of the 5th power that is required, and multiply that power by the index of the cube, 4th, or 5th power, and divide the dividend by this product, so shall the quotient be the second figure of the root required.\n\nRaise the part already found of the root, to the power whose root is required, and if that power be found less than the two first periods of the given number, the second figure of the root is right. But, if it be found greater, you must diminish the second figure of the root till that power be found equal to or less than those periods of the given number. Subtract it, and to the remainder annex the next period; and proceed till you have gone through the whole given number, finding the third figure by means of the two first, as you found the second by the first; and afterwards finding the fourth figure (if there be a fourth period) after the same manner from the three first.\"\n\nThus to find the cube root of 13824, point it 13824; find the greatest cube in 13, viz., 8, whose cube root 2 is the first figure of the root required. Subtract 8 from 13, and to the remainder 5 annex 8, the first figure of the second period; divide 58 by triple the square of 2, viz., 12, and the quotient is 4, which is the second figure of the root required, since the cube of 24 gives 13824, the number proposed. After the same manner the cube root of 13312053 is found to be 237.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n13824 & \\quad (24) \\\\\n\\text{Subtr. } 8 &= 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\\\\n3 \\times 4 &= 12 \\quad (4) \\\\\n\\text{Subtr. } 24 \\times 24 \\times 24 &= 13824 \\\\\n\\text{Rem.} & \\quad . . . 0 .\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nIn extracting of roots, after you have gone through the number proposed, if there is a remainder, you may continue the operation by adding periods of cyphers to that remainder, and find the true root in decimals to any degree of exactness.\n\n**Chap. VIII. Of Proportion.**\n\nWhen quantities of the same kind are compared, it may be considered, either how much the one is greater than the other, and what is their difference; or, it may be considered how many times the one is contained in the other; or, more generally, what is their quotient. The first relation of quantities is expressed by their arithmetical ratio; the second by their geometrical ratio. That term whose ratio is included into is called the antecedent, and that with which it is compared is called the consequent.\n\nWhen of four quantities the difference betwixt the first and second is equal to the difference betwixt the third and fourth, those quantities are called arithmetical proportionals; as the numbers 3, 7, 12, 16. And the quantities \\(a, a+b, c, c+b\\). But quantities form a series in arithmetical proportion, when they \"increase or decrease by the same constant difference.\" As these, \\(a, a+3b, a+6b, a+9b, \\ldots\\), \\(x, x-b, x-2b, \\ldots\\), or the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \\ldots, and 10, 7, 4, 1, \\ldots, 5, \\ldots, 8, \\ldots\\).\n\nIn four quantities arithmetically proportional, \"the sum of the extremes is equal to the sum of the mean terms.\"\nterms.\" Thus, \\(a, a+b, e, c+b\\), are arithmetical proportionals, and the sum of the extremes \\((a+c+b)\\) is equal to the sum of the mean terms \\((a+b+e)\\). Hence, to find the fourth quantity arithmetically proportional to any three given quantities; \"Add the second and third,\" and from their sum subtract the first term, the remainder shall give the fourth arithmetical proportional required.\n\nIn a series of arithmetical proportionals, \"the sum of the first and last terms is equal to the sum of any two terms equally distant from the extremes.\" If the first terms are \\(a, a+b, a+2b, \\ldots\\) and the last term \\(x\\), the last term but one will be \\(x-b\\), the last but two \\(x-2b\\), the last but three \\(x-3b, \\ldots\\) So that the first half of the terms, having those that are equally distant from the last term set under them, will stand thus;\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na, & \\quad a+b, \\quad a+2b, \\quad a+3b, \\quad a+4b, \\quad \\ldots \\\\\nx, & \\quad x-b, \\quad x-2b, \\quad x-3b, \\quad x-4b, \\quad \\ldots \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAnd it is plain, that if each term be added to the term above it, the sum will be \\(a+x\\), equal to the sum of the first term \\(a\\) and the last term \\(x\\). From which it is plain, that \"the sum of all the terms of an arithmetical progression is equal to the sum of the first and last taken half as often as there are terms;\" that is, the sum of an arithmetical progression is equal to the sum of the first and last terms multiplied by half the number of terms. Thus, in the preceding series, if \\(n\\) be the number of terms, the sum of all the terms will be \\(a+x \\times \\frac{n}{2}\\).\n\nThe common difference of the terms being \\(b\\), and \\(b\\) not being found in the first term, it is plain that \"its coefficient in any term will be equal to the number of terms that precede that term.\" Therefore in the last term \\(x\\) you must have \\(x-1 \\times b\\), so that \\(x\\) must be equal to \\(a+n-1 \\times b\\). And the sum of all the terms being\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a+x \\times n}{2}, \\text{ it will also be equal to } \\frac{2an+n^2b-nb}{2},\n\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a+nb-b \\times n}{2}. \\text{ Thus for example, the series } 1+2+3+4+5, \\ldots \\text{ continued to a hundred, must be equal to } \\frac{2 \\times 100+100 \\times 99}{2} = 5050.\n\\]\n\nIf a series have (o) nothing for its first term, then its sum shall be equal to half the product of the last term multiplied by the number of terms.\" For then \\(a\\) being \\(=0\\), the sum of the terms, which is in general \\(a+x \\times \\frac{n}{2}\\), will in this case be \\(\\frac{x \\times n}{2}\\). From which it is evident, that \"the sum of any number of arithmetical proportionals beginning from nothing, is equal to half the sum of as many terms equal to the greatest term.\"\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 &= 45 \\\\\n\\frac{9+9+9+9+9+9+9+9+9+9}{2} &= 45.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\"If of four quantities the quotient of the first and second be equal to the quotient of the third and fourth, then those quantities are said to be in geometrical proportion.\" Such are the numbers \\(2, 6, 4, 12\\); and the quantities \\(a, ar, b, br\\); which are expressed after this manner;\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2 : 6 & :: 4 : 12 \\\\\na : ar & :: b : br.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAnd you read them by saying, As 2 is to 6, so is 4 to 12; or, as \\(a\\) is to \\(ar\\), so is \\(b\\) to \\(br\\).\n\nIn four quantities geometrically proportional, \"the product of the extremes is equal to the product of the middle terms.\" Thus, \\(axbr=axxb\\). And, if it is required to find a fourth proportional to any three given quantities, \"multiply the second by the third, and divide their product by the first, the quotient shall give the fourth proportional required.\" Thus, to find a fourth proportional to \\(a, ar,\\) and \\(b\\), multiply \\(ar\\) by \\(b\\), and divide the product \\(arb\\) by the first term \\(a\\), the quotient \\(br\\) is the fourth proportional required.\n\nIn calculations it sometimes requires a little care to place the terms in due order; for which you may observe the following\n\n**Rule.** First set down the quantity that is of the same kind with the quantity sought; then consider, from the nature of the question, whether that which is given is greater or less than that which is sought; if it is greater, then place the greatest of the other two quantities on the left hand; but if it is less, place the least of the other two quantities on the left hand, and the other on the right.\n\nThen shall the terms be in due order; and you are to proceed according to the rule, multiplying the second by the third, and dividing their product by the first.\n\n**Example.** \"If 30 men do any piece of work in 12 days, how many men shall do it in 18 days?\"\n\nBecause it is a number of men that is sought, first set down 30, the number of men that is given: you will easily see that the number that is given is greater than the number that is sought; therefore place 18 on the left hand, and 12 on the right; and find a 4th proportional to 18, 30, 12, viz. \\(\\frac{30 \\times 12}{18} = 20\\).\n\nWhen a series of quantities increase by one common multiplicator, or decrease by one common divisor, they are said to be in geometrical proportion continued.\n\nAs, \\(a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ar^4, ar^5, \\ldots\\) or,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{r}, \\frac{a}{r^2}, \\frac{a}{r^3}, \\frac{a}{r^4}, \\frac{a}{r^5}, \\ldots\n\\]\n\nThe common multiplier or divisor is called their common ratio.\n\nIn such a series, \"the product of the first and last is always equal to the product of the second and last but one, or to the product of any two terms equally remote from the extremes.\" In the series, \\(a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, \\ldots\\) if \\(y\\) be the last term, then shall the four last terms of the series be \\(y, \\frac{y}{r}, \\frac{y}{r^2}, \\frac{y}{r^3}\\); now it is plain, that \\(axy=ax\\times \\frac{y}{r}=ar^2\\times \\frac{y}{r^2}=ar^3\\times \\frac{y}{r^3}, \\ldots\\)\nThe sum of a series of geometrical proportionals wanting the first term, is equal to the sum of all but the last term multiplied by the common ratio.\n\nFor \\( ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + \\ldots \\), etc., \\( + \\frac{y}{r} + \\frac{y}{r^2} + \\frac{y}{r^3} + \\ldots + y = r \\times a + ar + ar^2 + \\ldots \\), etc., \\( + \\frac{y}{r} + \\frac{y}{r^2} + \\frac{y}{r^3} + \\ldots + y \\).\n\nTherefore if \\( s \\) be the sum of the series, \\( s - a \\) will be equal to \\( s - y \\times r \\); that is, \\( s - a = sr - yr \\), or \\( sr - s = yr - a \\), and \\( s = \\frac{yr - a}{r - 1} \\).\n\nSince the exponent of \\( r \\) is always increasing from the second term, if the number of terms be \\( n \\), in the last term its exponent will be \\( n - 1 \\). Therefore \\( y = ar^{n-1} \\); and \\( yr = ar^n \\times ar^{n-1} = ar^n \\); and \\( r = \\frac{yr - a}{r - 1} = \\frac{ar^n - a}{r - 1} \\). So that having the first term of the series, the number of the terms, and the common ratio, you may easily find the sum of all the terms.\n\nIf it is a decreasing series whose sum is to be found, as of \\( y + \\frac{y}{r} + \\frac{y}{r^2} + \\frac{y}{r^3} + \\ldots \\), etc., \\( + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + \\ldots + a \\), and the number of the terms be supposed infinite, then shall \\( a \\), the last term, be equal to nothing. For, because \\( n \\), and consequently \\( r^{n-1} \\) is infinite, \\( a = \\frac{r}{r^n - 1} = 0 \\).\n\nThe sum of such a series \\( s = \\frac{yr}{r - 1} \\); which is a finite sum, though the number of terms be infinite. Thus,\n\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{16} + \\ldots = \\frac{1 \\times 2}{2 - 1} = 2.\n\\]\n\nand \\( 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{16} + \\ldots + \\frac{1}{32} + \\ldots = \\frac{1 \\times 3}{3 - 1} = \\frac{3}{2} \\).\n\n**Chap. IX. Of Equations that involve only one unknown Quantity.**\n\nAn equation is \"a proposition asserting the equality of two quantities.\" It is expressed most commonly by setting down the quantities, and placing the sign (=) between them.\n\nAn equation gives the value of a quantity, when that quantity is alone on one side of the equation; and that value is known, if all those that are on the other side are known. Thus if I find that \\( x = \\frac{4 \\times 6}{3} = 8 \\), I have a known value of \\( x \\). These are the last conclusions we are to seek in questions to be resolved; and if there be only one unknown quantity in a given equation, and only one dimension of it, such a value may always be found by the following rules.\n\n**Rule I.** Any quantity may be transposed from one side of the equation to the other, if you change its sign.\n\nFor to take away a quantity from one side, and to place it with a contrary sign on the other side, is to subtract it from both sides; and it is certain, that \"when from equal quantities you subtract the same quantity, the remainders must be equal.\"\n\nBy this rule, when the known and unknown quantities are mixed in an equation, you may separate them by bringing all the unknown to one side, and the known to the other side of the equation; as in the following examples,\n\nSuppose \\( 5x + 50 = x + 56 \\)\n\nby Transposition. \\( 5x - x = 56 - 50 \\), or, \\( x = 6 \\)\n\nAnd if \\( 2x + a = b + c \\)\n\n\\( 2x - x = b - a \\), or, \\( x = b - a \\).\n\n**Rule II.** Any quantity by which the unknown quantity is multiplied may be taken away, if you divide all the other quantities on both sides of the equation by it.\n\nFor that is to divide both sides of the equation by the same quantity, and when you divide equal quantities by the same quantity, the quotients must be equal. Thus,\n\nIf \\( ax = b \\)\n\nthen \\( x = \\frac{b}{a} \\);\n\nand if \\( 3x + 12 = 27 \\)\n\nby Rule 1st. \\( 3x = 27 - 12 = 15 \\)\n\nand by Rule 2d. \\( x = \\frac{15}{3} = 5 \\).\n\n**Rule III.** If the unknown quantity is divided by any quantity, that quantity may be taken away if you multiply all the other members of the equation by it.\n\nThus,\n\nIf \\( \\frac{x}{b} = b + 5 \\)\n\nthen shall \\( x = bb + 5b \\).\n\nBy this rule, an equation whereof any part is a fraction may be reduced to an equation that shall be expressed by integers. If there are more fractions than one in the given equation, you may, by reducing them to a common denominator, and then multiplying all the other terms by that denominator, abridge the calculation thus;\n\nIf \\( \\frac{x}{5} + \\frac{x}{3} = x - 7 \\)\n\nthen \\( \\frac{3x + 5x}{15} = x - 7 \\)\n\nand by this Rule \\( 3x + 5x = 15x - 105 \\)\n\nand by R. 1. and 2. \\( x = \\frac{105}{18} = 15 \\).\n\n**Rule IV.** If that member of the equation that involves the unknown quantity be a surd root, then the equation is to be reduced to another that shall be free from any surd, by bringing that member first to stand alone upon one side of the equation, and then taking away the radical sign from it, and raising the other side of the equation to the power denominated by the surd.\n\nThus if \\( \\sqrt{4x + 16} = 12 \\)\n\n\\( 4x + 16 = 144 \\)\n\nand \\( 4x = 144 - 16 = 128 \\)\n\nand \\( x = \\frac{128}{4} = 32 \\).\nRule V. If that side of the equation that contains the unknown quantity be a compleat square, cube, or other power; then extract the square root, cube root, or the root of that power, from both sides of the equation, and thus the equation shall be reduced to one of a lower degree.\n\nIf \\( x^2 + 6x + 9 = 20 \\)\nthen \\( x + 3 = \\sqrt{20} \\)\nand \\( x = \\sqrt{20} - 3 \\).\n\nRule VI. A proportion may be converted into an equation asserting the product of the extreme terms equal to the product of the mean terms; or any one of the extremes equal to the product of the means divided by the other extreme.\n\nIf \\( 12 - x : \\frac{x}{2} :: 4 : 1 \\)\nthen \\( 12 - x = 2x \\) ... \\( 3x = 12 \\) ... and \\( x = 4 \\).\n\nOr if \\( 20 - x : x :: 7 : 3 \\)\nthen \\( 60 - 3x = 7x \\) ... \\( 10x = 60 \\) ... and \\( x = 6 \\).\n\nRule VII. If any quantity be found on both sides of the equation with the same sign prefixed, it may be taken away from both: Also, if all the quantities in the equation are multiplied or divided by the same quantity, it may be struck out of them all. Thus,\n\nIf \\( 3x + b = a + b \\) ... \\( 3x = a \\) ... and \\( x = \\frac{a}{3} \\).\n\nRule VIII. Instead of any quantity in an equation, you may substitute another equal to it.\n\nThus if \\( 3x + y = 24 \\)\nand \\( y = 9 \\)\nthen \\( 3x + 9 = 24 \\) ... \\( x = \\frac{24 - 9}{3} = 5 \\).\n\nThe further improvements of this rule shall be taught in the following chapter.\n\nChap. X. Of the Solution of Questions that produce Simple Equations.\n\nSimple equations are those \"wherein the unknown quantity is only of one dimension.\" In the solution of which, we are to observe the following directions.\n\nDirect. I. \"After forming a distinct idea of the question proposed, the unknown quantities are to be expressed by letters, and the particulars to be translated from the common language into the algebraic manner of expressing them, that is, into such equations as shall express the relations or properties that are given of such quantities.\"\n\nThus, if the sum of two quantities must be 60, that condition is expressed thus, \\( x + y = 60 \\).\nIf their difference must be 24, that condition gives \\( x - y = 24 \\).\n\nIf their product must be 1640, then \\( xy = 1640 \\).\nIf their quotient must be 6, then \\( \\frac{x}{y} = 6 \\).\nIf their proportion is as 3 to 2, then \\( x : y :: 3 : 2 \\) or \\( 2x = 3y \\); because the product of the extremes is equal to the product of the mean terms.\n\nDirect. II. \"After an equation is formed, if you have one unknown quantity only, then, by the rules of the preceding chapter, bring it to stand alone on one side, so as to have only known quantities on the other side:\" thus you shall discover its value.\n\nExamp. \"A person being asked what was his age, answered that \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of his age multiplied by \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of his age gives a product equal to his age. Qu. What was his age?\"\n\nIt appears from the question, that if you call his age \\( x \\), then shall \\( \\frac{3x}{4} \\times \\frac{x}{12} = x \\)\nthat is \\( \\frac{3x^2}{48} = x \\)\nand by Rule 3 ... \\( 3x^2 = 48x \\)\nand by R. 7 ... \\( 3x = 48 \\)\nwhence by R. 2 ... \\( x = 16 \\).\n\nDirect. III. \"If there are two unknown quantities, then there must be two equations arising from the conditions of the question: Suppose the quantities \\( x \\) and \\( y \\); find a value of \\( x \\) or \\( y \\) from each of the equations, and then, by putting these two values equal to each other, there will arise a new equation involving one unknown quantity; which must be reduced by the rules of the former chapter.\"\n\nExamp. I. \"Let the sum of two quantities be \\( s \\), and their difference \\( d \\). Let \\( s \\) and \\( d \\) be given, and let it be required to find the quantities themselves.\" Suppose them to be \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), then, by the supposition,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx + y &= s \\\\\nx - y &= d \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nwhence \\( \\begin{cases} x = s - y \\\\ x = d + y \\end{cases} \\)\n\nand \\( d + y = s - y \\)\n\\( 2y = s - d \\)\n\\( y = \\frac{s - d}{2} \\)\nand \\( x = \\frac{s + d}{2} \\).\n\nExamp. II. \"A privateer running at the rate of 10 miles an hour, discovers a ship 18 miles off making way at the rate of 8 miles an hour: It is demanded how many miles the ship can run before she be overtaken?\"\n\nLet the number of miles the ship can run before she be overtaken be called \\( x \\), and the number of miles the privateer must run before she come up with the ship be \\( y \\); then shall (by supp.) \\( y = x + 18 \\) ... and \\( x : y :: 8 : 10 \\)...\nwhence \\(10x = 8y \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\frac{4y}{5}\\). And \\(x = y - 18\\), whence \\(y - 18 = \\frac{4y}{5}\\) and \\(y = 90\\). \\(x = y - 18 = 72\\).\n\nTo find the time, say, If 8 miles give 1 hour, 72 miles will give 9 hours. Thus, \\(8 : 1 :: 72 : 9\\).\n\n**Examp. III.** \"Suppose the distance between London and Edinburgh to be 360 miles; and that a courier sets out from Edinburgh, running at the rate of 10 miles an hour; another sets out at the same time from London, and runs 8 miles an hour: It is required to know where they will meet?\"\n\nSuppose the courier that sets out from Edinburgh runs \\(x\\) miles, and the other \\(y\\) miles, before they meet, then shall,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\{ & x + y = 360 \\\\\n& x : y :: 5 : 4 \\\\\n& x = \\frac{5y}{4} \\\\\n& x = 360 - y \\\\\n& \\frac{5y}{4} = 360 - y \\\\\n& 5y + 4y = 360 \\\\\n& 9y = 1440 \\\\\n& y = 160 \\\\\n& x = 360 - y = 200\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Examp.

IV.** \"When in one of the given equations the unknown quantity is of one dimension, and in the other of a higher dimension; you must find a value of the unknown quantity from that equation where it is of one dimension, and then raise that value to the power of the unknown quantity in the other equation; and by comparing it, so involved, with the value you deduce from that other equation, you shall obtain an equation that will have only one unknown quantity, and its powers.\"\n\nThat is, when you have two equations of different dimensions, if you cannot reduce the higher to the same dimension with the lower, you must raise the lower to the same dimension with the higher.\n\n**Examp. V.** \"The sum of two quantities, and the difference of their squares, being given, to find the quantities.\" Suppose them to be \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), their sum \\(s\\), and the difference of their squares \\(d\\).

VII.**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx + y &= a \\\\\nx + z &= b \\\\\ny + z &= c \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSupp.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx - y &= a \\\\\na - y + z &= b \\\\\ny + z &= c \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na + o + 2z &= b + c \\\\\n2z &= b + c - a \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nz &= \\frac{b + c - a}{2} \\\\\ny &= \\frac{c + a - b}{2} \\\\\nx &= \\frac{a + b - c}{2} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nIt is obvious from the 3d and 5th directions, in what manner you are to work if there are four, or more, unknown quantities, and four, or more, equations given. By comparing the given equations, you may always at length discover an equation involving only one unknown quantity; which, if it is a simple equation, may always be resolved by the rules of the last chapter. We may conclude then, that \"When there are as many simple equations given as quantities required, these quantities may be discovered by the application of the preceding rules.\"\n\nIf indeed there are more quantities required than equations given, then the question is not limited to determinate quantities; but is capable of an infinite number of solutions. And, if there are more equations given than there are quantities required, it may be impossible to find the quantities that will answer the conditions of the question; because some of these conditions may be inconsistent with others.\n\n**Chap. XI. Containing some general Theorems for the exterminating unknown Quantities in given Equations.**\n\nIn the following Theorems, we call those coefficients of the same order that are prefixed to the same unknown quantities in the different equations. Thus in Theor. 2d, \\(a, d, g\\) are of the same order, being the coefficients of \\(x\\); also \\(b, e, h\\) are of the same order, being the coefficients of \\(y\\); and those are of the same order that affect no unknown quantity.\n\nBut those are called opposite coefficients that are taken each from a different equation, and from a different order of coefficients: As, \\(a, e, k\\) in the first theorem; and \\(a, e, k\\) in the second; also, \\(a, b, f\\); and \\(d, b, k\\), &c.\n\n---\n\n**Theorem I.**\n\nSuppose that two equations are given, involving two unknown quantities, as,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nax + by &= c \\\\\ndx + ey &= f \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nthen shall \\(y = \\frac{af - dc}{ae - db}\\),\n\nwhere the numerator is the difference of the products of the opposite coefficients in the orders in which \\(y\\) is not found, and the denominator is the difference of the products of the opposite coefficients taken from the orders that involve the two unknown quantities.\n\nFor, from the first equation, it is plain, that\n\n\\[\nax = c - by \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\frac{c - by}{a}\n\\]\n\nfrom the 2d, \\(dx = f - ey \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\frac{f - ey}{d}\\)\n\ntherefore \\(\\frac{c - by}{a} = \\frac{f - ey}{d}\\), and \\(cd - dbey = af - aey\\)\n\nwhence \\(aey - dbey = af - cd\\),\n\nand \\(y = \\frac{af - cd}{ae - db}\\)\n\nafter the same manner, \\(x = \\frac{ci - bf}{ae - db}\\).\n\n**Examp.

XII. Of Quadratic Equations.**\n\nIn the solution of any question, where you have got an equation that involves one unknown quantity, but involves\nvolves at the same time the square of that quantity, and\nthe product of it multiplied by some known quantity,\nthen you have what is called a Quadratic equation;\nwhich may be resolved by the following","sp":116,"ep":126},{"h":"PULMONES","t":"The lungs are two large spongy bodies, of a reddish colour in children, greyish in adult subjects, and bluish in old age; filling the whole cavity of the thorax, one being seated in the right side, the other in the left, parted by the mediastinum and heart, and of a figure answering to that of the cavity which contains them; that is, convex next the ribs, concave next the diaphragm, and irregularly flattened and depressed next the mediastinum and heart.\n\nThey are distinguished into the right and left lung; and each of these into two or three portions called lobes; of which the right lung has commonly three, or two and a half, and the left lung two. The right lung is generally larger than the left, answerably to that cavity of the breast, and the obliquity of the mediastinum.\n\nAt the lower edge of the left lung, there is an indented notch or sinus opposite to the apex of the heart; which is therefore never covered by that lung, even in the strongest inspirations, and consequently the apex of the heart and pericardium may always strike against the ribs.\n\nThe substance of the lungs is almost all spongy, being made up of an infinite number of membranous cells, and of different sorts of vessels spread among the cells, in innumerable ramifications.\n\nThis whole mass is covered by a membrane continued from each pleura, which is commonly said to be double; but what is looked upon as the inner membrane is only an expansion and continuation of a cellular substance.\n\nThe vessels which compose part of the substance of the lungs are of three or four kinds; the air-vessels, blood-vessels, and lymphatics, and the nerves. The air-vessels make the chief part, and are termed bronchia.\n\nThese bronchia are conical tubes, composed of an infinite number of cartilaginous fragments, like so many irregular arches of circles, connected together by a ligamentary elastic membrane, and disposed in such a manner as that the lower easily insinuate themselves within those above them.\nThey are lined on the inside by a very fine membrane, which continually discharges a mucilaginous fluid; and in the substance of the membrane are a great number of small blood-vessels.\n\nThe bronchia are divided in all directions into an infinite number of ramifications, which diminish gradually in size; and as they become capillary, change their cartilaginous structure into that of a membrane.\n\nEach of these numerous bronchial tubes is widened at the extremity, and thereby formed into a small membranous cell, commonly called a vesicle. These cells or folliculi are closely connected together in bundles; each small branch producing a bundle proportionable to its extent and the number of its ramifications.\n\nThese small vesicular or cellular bundles are termed lobules; and as the great branches are divided into small rami, so the great lobules are divided into several small ones. The cells or vesicles of each lobule have a free communication with each other, but the several lobules do not communicate so readily.\n\nThe lobules appear distinctly to be parted by another cellular substance, which surrounds each of them in proportion to their extent, and fills up the interstices between them. This substance forms likewise a kind of irregular membranous cells, which are thinner, looser, and broader than the bronchial vesicles.\n\nAll the bronchial cells are surrounded by a very fine reticular texture of the small extremities of arteries and veins, which communicate every way with each other.\n\nThe blood-vessels of the lungs are of two kinds; one common, called the pulmonary artery and veins; the other proper, called the bronchial arteries and veins.\n\nThe pulmonary artery goes out from the right ventricle of the heart; and its trunk having run almost directly upward as high as the curvature of the aorta, is divided into two lateral branches, one going to the right-hand, called the right pulmonary artery, the other to the left, termed the left pulmonary artery. The right artery passes under the curvature of the aorta, and is consequently longer than the left. They both run to the lungs, and are dispersed through their whole substance by ramifications nearly like those of the bronchia, and lying in the same directions.\n\nThe pulmonary veins, having been distributed through the lungs in the same manner, go out on each side, by two great branches, which open laterally into the reservoir or muscular bag of the right auricle.\n\nBesides these capital blood-vessels, there are two others called the bronchial artery and vein.\n\nUnder the root of each lung, that is, under that part formed by the subordinate trunk of the pulmonary artery, by the trunks of the pulmonary veins, and by the trunk of the bronchia, there is a pretty broad membranous ligament, which ties the posterior edge of each lung to the lateral parts of the vertebrae of the back, from that root all the way to the diaphragm.\n\nThe bronchia already described are branches or ramifications of a large canal, partly cartilaginous, and partly membranous, called trachea, or alpere arteria. It is situated anteriorly in the lower part of the neck, from whence it runs down into the thorax betwixt the two pleurae, through the upper space left between the duplicature of the mediastinum, behind the thymus.\n\nHaving reached as low as the curvature of the aorta, it divides into two lateral parts, one toward the right-hand, the other toward the left, which enter the lungs, and are distributed through them in the manner already said. These two branches are called bronchia, and that on the right side is shorter than that of the left.\n\nThe trachea is made up of segments of circles or cartilaginous hoops, disposed in such a manner, as to form a canal open on the back part, the cartilages not going quite round; but this opening is filled by a soft glandular membrane, which completes the circumference of the canal.\n\nEach circle is about the twelfth part of an inch in breadth, and about a quarter of that space in thickness. Their extremities are round; and they are situated horizontally above each other, small interstices being left between them, and the lower edge of the superior segments being turned toward the upper edge of those next below them.\n\nThey are all connected by a very strong elastic membranous ligament fixed to their edges.\n\nThe canal of the alpere arteria is lined on the inside by a particular membrane, which appears to be partly fleshy or muscular, and partly ligamentary, perforated by an infinite number of small holes, through which a mucilaginous fluid continually passes, to defend the inner surface of the trachea against the acrimony of the air.\n\nThis fluid comes from small glandular bodies dispersed through the substance of the membrane, but especially from the glands, something larger than the former, which lie on the outer or posterior surface of that strong membrane, by which the circumference of the canal is completed. The same structure is observable in the ramifications of the trachea from the greatest to the smallest.\n\nAt the angle of the first ramification of the trachea arteria, we find on both the fore and back sides, certain soft, roundish, glandular bodies, of a bluish or blackish colour, and of a texture partly like that of the thymus already described, and partly like that of the glandula thyroidea. There are other glands of the same kind, as the origin of each ramification of the bronchia, but they decrease proportionably in number and size. They are fixed immediately to the bronchia, and covered by the interlobular substance; and they seem to communicate by small openings with the cavity of the bronchia.\n\nRespiration is performed by organs of two kinds, one of which may be looked upon as active, the other as passive. The lungs are of the second kind, and the first comprehends chiefly the diaphragm and intercostal muscles.\n\nAs soon as the intercostal muscles begin to contract, the arches of the ribs are raised together with the sternum, and placed at a greater distance from each other; by which means the cavity of the thorax is enlarged on the two lateral and anterior sides.\n\nAt the same instant, the diaphragm is flatted or brought toward a plane by two motions, which are apparently contrary; that is, by the contraction of the diaphragm, and the dilatation of the ribs in which it is inserted. The external surface of the thorax being thus in a manner increased, and the cavity of the bronchia...\nbeing at the same time, and by the same means, less resisted or pressed upon; the ambient air yields to the external pressure, and infuses itself into all the places where the pressure is diminished, that is, into the apera arteria, and into all the ramifications of the bronchia all the way to the vehicles. This is what is called inspiration.\n\nThis motion of inspiration is instantaneous, and ceases in a moment by the relaxation of the intercostal muscles; the elastic ligaments and cartilages of the ribs bringing them back at the same time to their former situation. This motion, by which the ribs are depressed and brought nearer each other, is termed expiration.\n\nThe pulmonary arteries and veins which accompany the bronchia through all their ramifications, and surround the vehicles, transmit the blood through their narrow capillary extremities, and thereby change or modify it, at least in three different manners.\n\nThe first change or modification which the blood undergoes in the lungs, is to have the cohesions of its parts broken, to be attenuated, pounded, and, as it were, reduced to powder. The second is, to be deprived of a certain quantity of serum, which transpires through the lungs, and is what we commonly call the breath. The third is to be in a manner reanimated by the impression of the air.\n\n**OESOPHAGUS.**\n\nThe oesophagus is a canal partly muscular, and partly membranous, situated behind the trachea arteria, and before the vertebrae of the back, from near the middle of the neck, down to the lower part of the thorax; from whence it passes into the abdomen through a particular hole of the small or inferior muscle of the diaphragm, and ends at the upper orifice of the stomach.\n\nIt is made up of several coats, almost in the same manner as the stomach, of which it is the continuation. The first coat, while in the thorax, is formed only by the duplicature of the posterior part of the mediastinum, and is wanting above the thorax and the neck, where the outer coat of the oesophagus is only a continuation of the cellular substance belonging to the neighbouring parts.\n\nThe second coat is muscular, being made up of several strata of fleshy fibres.\n\nThe third is termed the nervous coat, and is like that of the stomach and intestines.\n\nThe fourth or innermost coat resembles in some measure that of the intestines, except that instead of the villi it has small and very short papillae. Through the pores of this coat, a viscid lymph is continually discharged.\n\nThe oesophagus from its very beginning, turns a little to the left hand, and naturally runs along the left extremities of the cartilages of the apera arteria. The thyroid gland, pharynx and larynx, shall be described in another place.\n\n**DUCTUS THORACICUS.**\n\nThe thoracic duct is a thin transparent canal, which runs up from the receptaculum chyli, along the spina dorsii, between the vena azygos and aorta, as high as the fifth vertebra of the back, or higher. From thence it passes behind the aorta toward the left hand, and ascends behind the left subclavian vein, where it terminates in some subjects by a kind of vesicula, in others by several branches united together, and opens into the backside of the subclavian vein near the outside of the internal jugular.\n\nThis canal is plentifully furnished with semilunar valves turned upward. Its opening into the subclavian vein in the human body, is, in the place of valves, covered by several pelliculae, so disposed as to permit the entrance of the chyle into the vein, and hinder the blood from running into the duct. It is sometimes double, one lying on each side, and sometimes it is accompanied by appendices called pampiniformes.\n\n---\n\n**EXPLANATION OF PLATE XIX.**\n\n**Fig. 1.** Shews the contents of the thorax and abdomen, in situ.\n\n1, Top of the trachea, or wind-pipe. 2, The internal jugular veins. 3, The subclavian veins. 4, The vena cava descendens. 5, The right auricle of the heart. 6, The right ventricle. 7, Part of the left ventricle. 8, The aorta ascendens. 9, The pulmonary artery. 10, The right lung, part of which is cut off to shew the great blood-vessels. 11, The left lung entire. 12, The anterior edge of the diaphragm. 13, The two great lobes of the liver. 14, The ligamentum rotundum. 15, The gall bladder. 16, The stomach. 17, The jejunum and ilium. 18, The spleen.\n\n**Fig. 2.** Shews the organs subservient to the chylomicric viscera,\u2014with those of urine and generation.\n\n1, The under side of the two great lobes of the liver. 2, Lobulus Spigelii. 3, The ligamentum rotundum.\n\n**Fig. 3.** Shews the chylomicric viscera, and organs subservient to them, taken out of the body intact.\n\nA A, The under side of the two great lobes of the liver.

There are but five species of Rheum, none of whose leaves are palmated, except the species now described.\n\nBut though the above description be sufficient for ascertaining the genus and species of this valuable plant, there are other reasons for giving a complete botanical description of the whole parts of it. The true rhubarb, though of the most extensive use in medicine, was never known in this country till the year 1762, when Dr Mounsey brought some seeds from Russia, and gave them to Dr Hope professor of medicine and botany in Edinburgh. Dr Hope sowed them in the botanical garden, and collected about 30 seeds from one of the plants, which rose to eight feet in height. This plant is now propagating in the botanic garden, in the garden of Sir Alexander Dick, and many other gardens in Scotland. The root is found, by repeated trials, to be equally powerful in its operation as the best foreign rhubarb; and we have the greatest reason to hope, that in a short time this plant will be so universally cultivated as to prevent the future importation of it. The first botanic description we have of the true rhubarb was published by Dr Hope in the philosophical transactions for the year 1765*; which we shall translate into English.\n\n* Vid. Phil. Trans. for the year 1765.\nThe Root, is of the branchy kind, and perennial.\n\nThe Leaves (of which b in the plate is an outline) are about fifteen in number, grow near the root, about two feet long, and are furnished with petioles or foot-stalks.\n\n\u2014The petioles are about a foot long, cylindrical, plane above, smooth, of a green colour, but in some places interspersed with small, narrow, purple spots; at the base of the leaf, the petiolus terminates in three or five large nerves or ribs, which are prominent above; the leaves are ovated, deep cut, with sharp lacinia or segments; the superior part of the base is green, the inferior of a whitish green, and both are a little rough.\n\nThe Caulis or Stem is erect, somewhat cylindrical, fleshy or hollow within, jointed, sheathed, rough, striated, about eight feet high, and about two inches over near the base. It has fourteen joints, each of which, from the base to the ninth joint, is furnished with a reflected leaf, placed alternately, gradually diminishing as they rise higher, and the petiolus forms a kind of sheath, which embraces the stem.\n\nThe Pedunculi or Foot-stalks of the flowers, which are numerous, arise from the axil or arm-pits of the leaves, are almost erect, unequal, striated, cylindrical, plainish at the base, and out of their sides other foot-stalks arise, to be distributed in the same manner.\n\nc, is a flowering branch separated from the stem.\n\nThe Taste, Odour, and Colour of the Root are precisely the same with those of the foreign rhubarb.\n\nThe Taste of the Flowers is astringent, herbaceous and subacid; they have no sensible smell.\n\nThe Taste of the Leaves is bitterish, astringent, and herbaceous; the taste of the Ribs or Nerves is acid, bitterish, and very ungrateful;\u2014the taste of the Stem is a little sour.\n\nWe have now pretty fully explained the method of reducing plants to classes, orders, genera, and species, according to the sexual system of Linn\u00e6us. The manner in which this explanation has been executed was suggested by the difficulties which naturally occur to a person unacquainted both with the subject and the system. Although this manner has not, so far as we know, been hitherto attempted, we hope it will not be the least acceptable to the public, especially as it is likely to be more useful to the botanical student.\n\nIt only now remains to make the reader more fully acquainted with the origin and nature of the sexual system.\n\nSect. III. Of the Sexes of Plants.\n\nAs many philosophers and botanists deny that such a thing as the distinction of sexes takes place in vegetables, it will be necessary to give a narration of the arguments employed by both parties on this subject. We shall begin with the arguments in favour of the sexes.\n\nLinn\u00e6us, like every person attached to a particular doctrine or theory, is at great pains in tracing the notion of sexes in plants to the remotest periods of antiquity. He informs us, that Empedocles, Anaxagoras, and other ancient philosophers, not only attributed the distinction of sexes to plants, but maintained that they were capable of perceiving pleasure and pain.\n\nHippocrates and Theophrastus are next introduced as distinguishing the conyza, the abies, the filix, &c., into male and female. The latter of these writers affirms, that the fruit of the female palm will not germinate unless the pollen of the male be shaked over the spathe of the female, previous to the ripening of the seed.\n\nDioecorides takes notice of a male and female mandragora, mercurialis, cistus, &c.\n\nPliny does not confine his views of sex to animals, but exclaims, that every thing this earth produces is characterized by the distinction of sex.\n\nFrom the days of Pliny to those of C\u00e6salpinus, who lived in the 16th century, the analogy between the vegetable and animal seems to have been entirely neglected. C\u00e6salpinus tells us, that the males of the oxycoccus, taxus, mercurialis, urtica, and cannabis, are barren; and that the females of these plants only bear fruit.\n\nAfter C\u00e6salpinus, we find Dr Grew and Sir Thomas Millington engaged in a conversation concerning the utility of the stamens and styli of plants. The result of this conversation was the mutual agreement of these two eminent naturalists, that the stamens and styli of vegetables were analogous to the organs of generation in animals, and that they were adapted by nature to answer the same purposes. Dr Grew, in his anatomy of plants, after enumerating the analogies between plants and animals, concludes, that the pollen probably emits certain vivific effluvia, which may serve for the impregnation of the seeds.\n\nMr Ray gave a further sanction to the doctrine of sexes, by concurring with Grew, and adding some further illustrations from analogy.\n\nIn the year 1695, Camerarius attempted to prove the sexes of plants. But, as he trusted solely to the palm-tree, and withal seemed to be doubtful as to the authenticity of the fact, he cannot be considered as having done anything in confirmation of the sexual hypothesis.\n\nMr Morland, in the year 1703, adopted the same hypothesis; but gave it a new modification, by supposing that the pollen contained the seminal plant in miniature; and consequently, that one pollen at least behoved to be conveyed into every separate seed before it could be properly impregnated. Analogy and the structure of the parts are the only arguments he employs.\n\nSome years after this, Mr Geoffroy wrote a treatise on the sexes of plants: But as he advanced nothing new, we shall take no further notice of him.\n\nVaillant, in the 1717, judiciously considering that the canal in the stylus of most plants was too narrow to admit the pollen itself, republished Dr Grew's theory of impregnation by means of a subtile seminal aura.\nThese are the sentiments of the principal botanists with regard to the generation of plants, till the celebrated Linn\u00e6us made his appearance as a botanical writer, who has extended the idea so far as to compose a complete system upon it.\n\nAlthough Linn\u00e6us can have no claim to the supposed discovery of the sexual hypothesis, his being precisely the same with that of Dr Grew; yet, as he is the chief supporter and improver of this doctrine, we shall give a succinct narration of the arguments he makes use of in order to prove that vegetables propagate their species by a regular commerce of sexes.\n\nIn a treatise, intitled, *Sponfalia Plantarum*, published as an inaugural dissertation by Wahlbom, in the first volume of the *Annitates Academicae*, all the arguments made use of by Linn\u00e6us in his *Fundamenta Botanica* and other works, are collected and arranged in one view. But as Wahlbom honestly attributes all the merit of this dissertation to his great master, we shall here drop his name altogether, and give the arguments as the property of Linn\u00e6us, by whom they were originally employed.\n\nLinn\u00e6us, then, first attempts to show, that vegetables are endowed with a certain degree of animal life; and, secondly, that they propagate their species in a manner similar to that of animals.\n\n\"That vegetables are really animated beings,\" says he, \"must be obvious at first sight; because they possess all the properties contained in that accurate definition of life laid down by the great Dr Harvey, namely, *Vita est spontanea propulsio humorum*. But universal experience teaches, that vegetables propel humours or juices: Hence it is plain that vegetables must be endowed with a certain degree of animal life.\"\n\nNot trifling solely to a syllogism founded on a definition, Linn\u00e6us proceeds to support the life of vegetables by arguments drawn from the following particulars in their economy; the first of which he intitles\n\n**Nutrition.**\u2014The very idea of nutrition implies a propulsion of humours, and, of course, the idea of life. But vegetables derive their nourishment from the earth, air, &c., and consequently must be considered as living creatures.\n\n2. **Metabolism.**\u2014Every animal must not only begin to exist, and have that existence dissolved by death, but must likewise pass through a number of intermediate changes in its appearance and affections. Infancy, youth, manhood, old age, are characterized by imbecility, beauty, fertility, doting; are not all these vicissitudes conspicuous in the vegetable world? Weak and tender in infancy; beautiful and salacious in youth; grave, robust, and fruitful in manhood; and when old age approaches, the head droops, the springs of life dry up, and, in fine, the poor tottering vegetable returns to that dust from whence it sprung.\n\n3. **Motility.**\u2014No inanimate body is capable of self-motion. Whatever moves spontaneously is endowed with a living principle; for motion depends on the spontaneous propulsion of humours, and where-ever there is a spontaneous propulsion of humours, there also is life. That vegetables are capable of motion is evident from the following facts: Plants, when confined within doors, always bend towards the light, and some of them even attempt to make their escape by the windows. The flowers of many plants, especially those of the syngenesia clas, pursue the sun from east to west, rejoicing in his beams. Who then can deny that vegetables are possessed of living and self-moving powers?\n\n4. **Morbis.**\u2014The term *disease* means nothing more than a certain corruption of life: It is well known, that vegetables are subject to diseases as well as animals: When over-heated, they turn thirsty, languish, and fall to the ground: When too cold, they are tormented with the chillblain, and not unfrequently expire: They are sometimes afflicted with cancers; and every plant is infected with lice peculiar to its species.\n\n5. **Mors.**\u2014Death is opposed to life, the former being only a privation of the latter. Experience shows, that every living creature must die. But, as vegetables are daily cut off by internal diseases and external injuries; as they are subject to death from the attacks of hunger, thirst, heat, cold, &c. with what propriety could vegetables be thus said to die, unless we allow that they previously lived?\n\n6. **Anastomia.**\u2014Under this article we are referred to Malpighius and Grew for the organic fibres, membranes, canals, vessels, &c. of plants, as additional proofs of their living powers.\n\n7. **Organization.**\u2014Vegetables not only propel humours, but also prepare and secrete a number of different juices for the fruit, the nectar, &c. analogous to the various secretions in animal bodies.\n\nFrom these facts and observations, Linn\u00e6us concludes, that plants are unquestionably endowed with life as well as animals; and then proceeds in the following manner to show how these animated vegetables propagate their species.\n\nAfter discussing the long exploded doctrine of equivocal generation, he lays hold of another maxim of Dr. Harvey, viz. *Omne vivum ex ovo.*\u2014\"It being fully evident,\" says he, \"from the foregoing chain of reasoning, that vegetables are endowed with life, it necessarily follows, agreeable to this maxim of Harvey's, that every vegetable must in like manner derive its existence from an egg. But as vegetables proceed from eggs, and as it is the distinguishing property of an egg to give birth to a being similar to that which produced it, the seeds must of course be the eggs of vegetables.\n\nGranting then that the seeds of vegetables are intended by nature to answer the same end as the eggs of animals, and considering at the same time that no egg can be fecundated without receiving an impregnation from the male, it follows, that the seed or eggs of vegetables cannot be fecundated by any other means. Hence also the necessity of vegetables being provided with organs of generation. But where are these organs situated? The answer is easy.\u2014We have already found impregnated seeds within the flowers of plants; and it is natural to expect that the genitalia should not be at a great distance. Now, as copulation always precedes birth, and every flower precedes the fruit, the generating faculty must be ascribed to the flower, and the birth to the fruit. Again, as the anther\u00e6 and stigma are the only essential...\nRheum Palmatum\nor\nTrue Rhubarb\ntial parts of flowers, these parts must necessarily be the organs of generation.\"\n\nBeing thus far advanced, Linnaeus affirms, that the anther\u00e6 are the testes; and that the pollen performs the office of the male semen. These affirmations he attempts to establish by the following arguments; the first of which he terms\n\n\"1. Pr\u00e6cedentia.\u2014The anther\u00e6, or vegetable testes, always precede the fruit; and as soon as the anther\u00e6 come to maturity, which constantly happens before the maturity of the fruit, they continue to throw out their pollen as long as the flower lasts; but decay and fall off whenever the fruit comes to perfection.\n\n\"2. Situs.\u2014The anther\u00e6 of all plants are uniformly situated in such a manner that the pollen may with the greatest facility fall upon the stigma or female organ.\n\n\"3. Tempus.\u2014The anther\u00e6 and stigmata always flourish at the same time, whether the flowers be of the hermaphrodite or dioicous kind.\n\n\"4. Localumenta.\u2014When the anther\u00e6 are dissected, they discover as great a variety of structure as the pericarpia or seed capsules: For some of them have one cell, as the mercury; some two, as the hellebore, &c.\n\n\"5. Castratio.\u2014If all the anther\u00e6 be cut off from an hermaphrodite plant, just before the flowers begin to expand, taking care at the same time that no plant of the same species grows near it, the fruit will either prove entirely abortive, or produce barren seeds.\n\n\"6. Figura.\u2014When the pollen of different plants is examined by the microscope, it exhibits as great a variety of figures as is discoverable in the seeds themselves.\n\n\"The accumulated force of these arguments,\" concludes Linnaeus, \"amounts to a full demonstration that the anther\u00e6 are the testes, and that the pollen is the semen or genitura of vegetables.\n\n\"The male organ being thus investigated, we hope,\" says Linnaeus, \"that none will hesitate to pronounce the stigma to be the female organ, especially when the following observations are sufficiently attended to.\n\n\"The pistillum is composed of the germen, stylus, and stigma. The germen being only a kind of rudiment of the future fetus or seed, ceases to exist as soon as the flower comes to maturity. Neither is the stylus an essential part, as many flowers have no stylus. But no fruit ever comes to maturity without the assistance of the stigma. It follows, that the stigma must be the female organ adapted by nature for the reception of the pollen or impregnating substance. This will appear still clearer from the following chain of reasoning.\n\n\"1. Situs.\u2014The stigmata are always situated so that the pollen may with most ease fall upon them. Besides, it is remarkable, that in most plants (though not in all) the number of the stigmata exactly corresponds with the loculamenta or cells of the pericarpium.\n\n\"2. Tempus.\u2014Here the observation, that the stigmata and anther\u00e6 constantly flourish at the same time, is repeated.\n\n\"3. Decidentia.\u2014The stigmata of most plants, like the anther\u00e6, decay and fall off as soon as they have discharged their proper function; which evidently shows, that their office is not to ripen the fruit, but solely to answer the important purpose of impregnation.\n\n\"4. Abficiens.\u2014The argument here is precisely the same with the castration of the anther\u00e6; and the result is likewise the same, namely, the destruction of the fruit.\n\n\"These arguments,\" concludes Linnaeus, \"are sufficient to demonstrate, that the stigma is the female organ of generation, or that organ which is suited for the reception and conveyance of the semen to the vegetable eggs. Hence, plants may be said to be in actu venenis, when the anther\u00e6, or teficuli, spread their pollen over the stigma or female vulva.\"\n\nTo show how the c\u00e6tus of vegetables is effected, is our author's next object of investigation. He affirms, that the pollen is conveyed, by means of the wind or insects, to the moist stigma, where it remains until it discharges a subtile fluid, which, being absorbed by the vessels of the stigma, is carried to the seeds or ova, and impregnates them. His proofs are taken from the following particulars.\n\n\"1. Oculi.\u2014When the flowers are in full blow, and the pollen flying about, every one may then see the pollen adhering to the stigma. This, he illustrates by mentioning as examples the viola tricolor, iris, campaspe, &c.\n\n\"2. Proprio.\u2014The stamina and pistilla, in most plants are of equal heights, that the pollen, by the intervention of the wind, may, with the greater facility, fall upon the stigma.\n\n\"3. Locus.\u2014The stamina of most plants surround the pistillum, to give the pollen an opportunity of falling on the stigma at every breeze of wind. Even in the monoc\u00e6a clas, the male flowers stand generally above the female ones, to afford an easier conveyance of the pollen to the stigma.\n\n\"4. Tempus.\u2014It is remarkable that the stamina and pistilla constantly appear at the same time, even in plants belonging to the monoc\u00e6a clas.\n\n\"5. Pluvia.\u2014The flowers of most plants expand by the heat of the sun and shut themselves up in the evening or in rainy weather. The final cause of this must be, to keep the moisture from the pollen, lest it should be thereby coagulated, and of course prevented from being blown upon the stigma.\n\n\"6. Patricola.\u2014That the cultivators of palm trees were in use to pull off the spadices from the males, and suspend them over the spathe of the females, is attested by Theophrastus, Pliny, Prosper Alpinus, Kempfer, and many others. If this operation happened to be neglected, the dates were sour and destitute of nuts. Kempfer adds this singular circumstance, that the male spadix, after being thoroughly dried and kept till next season, still retained its impregnating virtue.\n\n\"7. Flores nutantes.\u2014As the pollen is specifically heavier than air, such flowers as have their pistillum longer than the stamina, hang down, or incline to one side, e.g. the fritillaria, campanula, &c. An easy admission of the pollen to the stigma, is the final cause of this appearance.\n\n\"8. Submersa.\u2014Many plants that grow below water, emerge when their flowers begin to blow, and swim\nupon the surface till they receive their impregnation, and then sink down.\n\n\"O. Omnium florum genuina consideratio.\u2014Here a number of particulars are recited. We shall confine ourselves to those that are most striking and applicable to the subject.\n\n\"When the flowers of the male hemp are pulled off before those of the female are fully expanded, the females do not produce fertile seeds. But as a male flower is sometimes found upon a female plant, this may be the reason why fertile seeds are sometimes produced even after this precaution has been observed.\n\n\"The tulip affords another experiment to the same purpose.\u2014Cut off all the anthers of a red tulip before the pollen is emitted; then take the ripe anthers of a white tulip, and throw the pollen of the white one upon the stigma of the red; the seeds of the red tulip being thus impregnated by one of different complexion, will next season produce some red, some white, but most variegated flowers.\"\n\nIn the year 1744, Linn\u00e6us published a description of a new genus, which he called peloria, on the supposition of its being a hybrid or mule plant, i.e., a plant produced by an unnatural commixture of two different genera. The root, leaves, caulis, &c. of this plant are exceedingly similar to those of the antirrhinum linaria; but the flower and other parts of fructification are totally different. On account of its similarity to the linaea in every part but the flower, Linn\u00e6us imagined it to have been produced by a fortuitous commixture of the linaea with some other plant, although he has never yet been able to condescend on the father. This doctrine of the production of mule plants has since been greatly prized and carefully propagated by Linn\u00e6us and the other supporters of the sexual hypothesis. In the third volume of the Commentarii Academici, there is a complete dissertation, intitled, Planta Hybridae, wherein the doctrine of vegetable mules is much improved and extended. This dissertation contains a list of 47 mules, with their supposed fathers and mothers. For example,\n\nThe Veronica Spuria is said to be a mule plant begot by the verbena officinalis upon the veronica maritima. The delphinium hybrida, a mule begot by the aconitum napellus upon the delphinium elatum. The arctotis calendula, a mule begot by the calendula pluvialis upon the arctotis triflora. The aclepias nigra, a mule begot by the cynanchum acutum upon the aclepias vincetoxicum, &c.\n\nFrom the examples given in this dissertation, Linn\u00e6us draws this singular conclusion, that only two species of each genus existed ab origine; and that all the variety of species which now appear have been produced by unnatural embraces between species of different genera.\n\nUnder this head, Linn\u00e6us likewise quotes from Ray the story of Richard Baal gardener at Brentford. This Baal sold a large quantity of the seeds of the brassica florida to several gardeners in the suburbs of London. These gardeners, after sowing their seeds in the usual manner, were surprised to find them turn out to be plants of a different species from that which Baal made them believe they had purchased; for, instead of the brassica florida, the plants turned out to be the brassica longifolia. The gardeners, upon making the discovery, commenced a prosecution of fraud against Baal in Westminster-hall. The court found Baal guilty of fraud, and decreed him not only to restore the price of the seeds, but likewise to pay the gardeners for their lost time, and the use of their ground.\n\n\"Had these judges (says Linn\u00e6us) been acquainted with the sexual hypothesis, they would not have found Baal guilty of any crime, but would have ascribed the accident to the fortuitous impregnation of the brassica florida by the pollen of the brassica longifolia.\"\n\nLinn\u00e6us next proceeds to celebrate the utility of insects, because they convey the pollen of the male to the stigma of the female. \"In this way,\" says he, \"it is reasonable to think that many dioecious plants are impregnated. Nay, even the hermaphrodites themselves are greatly obliged to the different tribes of insects, which, by fluttering and treading in the corolla, are constantly scattering the pollen about the stigma.\n\n\"Upon the whole,\" then, concludes Linn\u00e6us, \"the coitus of vegetables is evident to a demonstration. This coitus is nothing more than the conveyance of the pollen to the stigma, to which it adheres till it bursts and discharges a subtle elastic fluid. This fluid or aura is absorbed by the vessels of the stylus, and carried directly to the ovarium or germe, where the mysterious work of impregnation is fully completed.\"\n\nThese are the arguments employed by Linn\u00e6us and other advocates for the sexual commerce of vegetables.\u2014Let us next attend to those employed by the opposers of this hypothesis.\n\nIt is admitted by Pontedera, Dr Alton, &c. that some of the ancients applied the terms male and female to several plants. But then they deny that these terms conveyed the same ideas to the ancients that they do to the moderns. Male and female, when applied to plants, were to the ancients mere terms of distinction, serving only as trivial names to distinguish one species or variety from another. The ancients were ignorant of the very characters which constitute the difference between what is called a male and female plant among the moderns. Theophrastus, Dioscorides, Pliny, and, in a word, the whole ancient botanical writers, confound the very notion of the modern sexes; they call the real female, or seed-bearing plant, the male; and the male, or barren plant, the female. Nay, they have even applied the terms male and female to many plants which bear nothing but hermaphrodite flowers.\n\nSuch is the nature of this controversy, that it cannot be determined with any degree of certainty, but by experiments made upon dioecious plants. If a female plant can produce fertile seeds without having any communication with the pollen of the male, the use of this pollen, with respect to the impregnation of seeds, must of necessity be entirely superfluous.\n\nNow, both Camerarius and Dr Alston tried these experiments with the same success. Those two eminent botanists took female plants of the mercury, spinach, and hemp.\nhemp, transplanted them at a great distance from any males of the same genus, and besides had them inclosed by double rows of hedges. The result was, that each of these plants produced great quantities of fertile seeds. Tournefort made the same trial upon the lupulus, Miller upon the bryony, and Geoffroy upon the mays; and all of them declare that the seeds of these plants were as fertile as if they had been surrounded by a thousand males.\n\nLinnaeus, in his first argument for the coitus of plants, refers every man to the evidences of his senses.\n\n\"Do we not see, (says he) the stigma of almost every hermaphrodite flower covered over with the pollen or impregnating substance? Do not we see the pietaria, the urtica, &c., by violent explosions, discharging their pollen in the open air, that it may be carried in that vehicle to the stigmas of their respective females?\"\u2014All this is admitted by the opposers of the sexes; but then they deny that these explosions, &c., are intended to create any intercourse between the male and the female; and further allege, that this ejection of the pollen is intended by nature to throw off something excrementitious, or at least something, which, if retained, would prove noxious to the fructification.\n\nLinnaeus takes his second argument from the proportion which the stamina bear to the stylus, alleging that they are generally of the same height.\u2014This observation is not only contrary to experience, but, allowing it to be universal, no conclusion can be drawn from it either for or against the sexual hypothesis.\n\nThe third argument is taken from the locus or situation of the stamina with respect to the stylus; \"and as the male flowers in the monoecia clas stand always above the female flowers, it must be concluded (says Linnaeus) that the intention of nature, in this disposition of the parts, is to allow a free and easy access of the pollen to the stigma.\"\u2014But the stamina cannot be said to surround the pistillum in the monandra and diandra classes: And the position of the male flowers in the monoecia clas is a mere chimera; for in the ricinus, one of the examples which Linnaeus mentions in confirmation of his doctrine, the female flowers stand uniformly some inches above the males.\n\nThat the stamina and pistilla generally come to perfection at the same time, and that this happens even in the dioecious plants, is Linnaeus's fourth argument. But, as it is acknowledged by Linnaeus himself, that there are many exceptions with respect to this fact, the opposers of the sexual hypothesis alleged that it carries the best answer in its own bosom.\n\nThe fifth argument is founded on the circumstance of some flowers shutting up their petals in rainy or moist evenings.\u2014But many flowers do not shut themselves up, either in the night or moist weather, as the palmion-flower, &c. The lychnis noctiflora, mirabilis peruviana, &c., open their flowers in the night, and shut them at the approach of the sun. Hence this is another final cause evidently perverted to support a favourite hypothesis.\n\nWe come now to the culture of the palm-tree, which is the sixth and most plausible argument employed by the sexualists. Herodotus, Theophrastus, Pliny, and some others, have informed us, that the female palm-tree, unless a male grows sufficiently near it, or unless the pollen be artificially conveyed to the female stigma, will produce nothing but four dates and unfertile seeds. This fact is partly denied by Pere-Labat and Tournefort. The former of these authors expressly affirms, that a female palm-tree, in the garden belonging to the monastery at Martinico, produced most excellent fruit, although there was not a male within six miles of it: From which he concludes, that the presence of the male is not necessary to render this tree fruitful, whatever may be pretended by ancient or modern naturalists. Herodotus relates, that the people of Babylon, when the male was at too great a distance from the female, made a rope pass from the boughs of the one to the boughs of the other, to afford an opportunity to the culices and other insects to pass along the rope, and convey some kind of impregnating influence from the male to the female. Tournefort, when he was in that country, inquired at the most intelligent people of the place, as to the truth of this relation; but received for answer, That they had never heard of any such matter. Even the favourers of the sexual hypothesis give very different accounts of the method of cultivating palm-trees in those countries. Vellingius, who resided many years in Egypt, denies that any artificial method is employed for fructifying the palm-trees in that country. Thus Vellingius expressly contradicts Herodotus and many others. In a word, almost every different author gives a different account of this story. Amidst so many contradictions concerning the culture of palm-trees, the opposers of the sexes conclude, that the whole story is a vulgar error, taken for granted by some learned men, spuriously fathered upon others, and swallowed down without examination by their credulous readers.\u2014As we have not seen any answer to Myletius's letter on this subject, our observations upon it shall be reserved till this historical view of the controversy be finished.\n\nThe seventh argument of Linnaeus is taken from the flores nutantes.\u2014The pistils of these flowers, according to Linnaeus, are always longer than the stamina, and nature has assigned them this penile posture, that the pollen, which is specifically heavier than air, may the more conveniently fall upon the stigma.\u2014But the pistils of the campanula, lilium, and many other flores nutantes, are not longer than the stamina. Besides, granting this were uniformly the case; yet, as the pollen is heavier than air, this posture must of necessity either make the pollen miss the pistillum altogether, or, at any rate, it can only fall upon the back part of the pistil in place of the stigma; and, of course, such a direction would rather tend to frustrate than promote the impregnation of the seed.\n\nThe eighth argument is taken from the plantae submersae, which are said to emerge as soon as their flowers begin to blow, lest the pollen should be coagulated or washed off by the water.\u2014But many submarine and aquatic plants fructify entirely below water; and, supposing they did not, the same argument would equally prove it to be the intention of nature, that the pollen should be blown away by the winds, as that it should be subservient to the impregnation of the seed.\n\nTha.\nThe ninth and last argument is intitled *Omnium florum genuina consideratio*; which is nothing more than a collection of vague observations upon the structure and economy of particular plants, some of them true, others false, but all of them evidently thrust in as supports to a favourite hypothesis.\n\nHaving thus given a pretty full historical view of the controversy concerning the sexes of plants, we shall now lay before our readers a few observations that have occurred from the perusal of it.\n\nIt may be observed in general, that the facts and arguments adduced by the sexualists are by far too few to admit of any general induction. Nay, most of them are merely accidental, many of them not being uniform even in the same species; and the final causes of the whole are unnatural, and tortured so as best to answer the purposes of a theory, which, for all that hath yet been said, merits no higher appellation than that of a whimsical conjecture.\n\nFirst, then, Linn\u00e6us's reasoning is of a mixt nature, partly analogical, partly founded on observation. He sets out with an attempt to prove, that plants are endowed with a certain degree of animal life; and his fundamental reason is, because, agreeable to Dr Harvey's definition of life, they spontaneously propel humours.\u2014Strange, that a man of Linn\u00e6us's capacity, or indeed of any capacity at all, should seriously employ an argument pregnant with every degree of absurdity!\u2014Stranger still that he should take up near twenty pages in illustrating and drawing conclusions from such an argument!\u2014If Harvey has given a vague and unintelligible definition of life, can that be a sufficient excuse for laying hold of such a definition in order to fortify an untenable hypothesis? But, were Harvey's definition more accurate than it is, and were vegetables actually possessed of living powers, it is easy to conceive how the life of vegetables might be a proper test of, or contradiction to, the received definition: But, how a definition, which, from the complex and intricate nature of the subject defined, must necessarily be vague and precarious, can be employed in confirmation of any general theory, exceeds the powers of common apprehension.\n\nBut let us examine this notable definition a little further: What idea of life does a spontaneous propulsion of humours convey? If Harvey means to say, that men and other animals regulate the motion of their blood, and the secretions of their different humours, by certain exertions of the sentient principle, such a meaning is contradicted by universal experience; so far is this from being the case, that the most abstract attention cannot render us conscious of these motions. Again, if he means, that every body is endowed with life, whose organs are suited to propel humours, then the term spontaneous is absurd, because it attributes intellectual powers to the organs themselves, than which nothing can be more ridiculous. Besides, allowing the organs to enjoy an independent faculty of propulsion, what does this propulsion mean when applied to vegetables? Surely nothing more than a power of conveying certain liquors from the root to the superior parts of the plant.\u2014A wet cloth, with one end in contact with the water in any vessel, and the other hanging over its side, will do the same; so will a sponge, so will a bed of loose sand, so will a sugar loaf, &c.; but it is to be hoped, that mankind have more sense than to believe that a bit of cloth; or a sugar loaf, are animated beings.\n\nAs conscious of the lameness and futility of his reasoning on this subject, Linn\u00e6us endeavours further to corroborate the life of vegetables by analogies drawn from their nutrition, age, motions, diseases, death, anatomy, and organization. In these nothing new or remarkable occurs, excepting the uncommon method of reasoning, and the still more whimsical purposes to which this reasoning is applied. We shall take notice of his arguments under the articles of motion and death, which indeed are the chief of those which do not depend more or less upon the above definition.\n\nUnder the former of these, Linn\u00e6us informs us, that plants, when confined within doors, always bend towards the light; and that many flowers, particularly those of the syngenesia clas, pursue the course of the sun from east to west. This inclination of flowers towards the light, Linn\u00e6us would have us to believe are real instances of the living powers and spontaneous motion of plants.\u2014This phenomenon, however, may be easily accounted for, independent of any idea of life. Every body knows, that a certain degree of heat relaxes the tone of the vegetable organs, and at the same time proportionally evaporates the fluids which these organs contain. Now, to whatever side of the plant that heat is principally applied, there of necessity must also be the greatest flaccidity of the fibres, and the greatest evaporation of the fluids; of course, from the law of gravitation, the flower, indeed the whole plant, must incline towards that side from whence the light or heat proceeds. The slightest observation is sufficient to convince us of the propriety of this method of accounting for the inclination of heavy flowers supported by weak stems, towards the rays of the sun. If a pot of flowers be put loosely into a glass, and allowed to remain a little time in an apartment where a fire is burning, as soon as the fibres begin to be enervated, they all, unless obstructed by some other cause, bend towards the fire. Hence the absurdity of attributing this phenomenon to a sentient and living principle, which is more easily and with more certainty explained by the common laws of mechanism.\n\nLet us next attend to Linn\u00e6us's argument under the article of death. After telling us, with much solemnity, that death is only a privation of life, and that vegetables die of many grievous distempers, he thus concludes; \"With what propriety,\" says he, \"could vegetables be thus said to die, unless it be allowed that they previously lived?\" However, if the life of vegetables hath no other support than this trifling quibble, (for it merits not the name of argument), we are afraid that every man of common sense will conclude, that they never were endowed with life, and consequently cannot, with any more propriety than an ordinary figure of speech can bestow, be said to die.\n\nHaving in this manner attributed living powers to vegetables, Linn\u00e6us, in the next place, makes an effort to show\nNow, that they enjoy the faculty of generation. But what process of argumentation does he employ? He lays hold of another maxim of Dr Harvey: *Omne vivum ex ovo*, says Harvey. \"Now,\" adds Linnaeus, \"we have already proved that vegetables live; and therefore they must in like manner derive their origin from eggs. Again, no eggs can be fertilized without receiving an impregnation from the semen of the male: And hence the eggs or seeds of vegetables must likewise be impregnated by the male vegetable semen, in order to their fertilization. Further, it is an essential property of an egg to produce a creature of the same species with that from which itself was produced: Hence the seeds are the eggs of vegetables. Besides, as the antherae and stigmata are the only essential parts of a flower, it follows, that these parts are the organs of generation.\" In this way Linnaeus goes on till he finds the antherae to be the testes; the pollen, the semen; and the stigma, the female organ of generation.\n\nBut, as we have already shewn that Linnaeus has remarkably failed in the proof of his first point, namely, that vegetables are endowed with life, his subsequent reasoning, which rests solely on the supposition of the living powers of vegetables, must of course fall to the ground.\n\nHowever, allowing a spontaneous propulsion of humours to be a perfect definition of life, philologists are far from being agreed with regard to the propriety of Harvey's second maxim. *Omne vivum ex ovo* may be applied to a great variety of animals. But to this day it remains a very doubtful point, whether man and most quadrupeds derive their existence from the same source. Hence the impropriety of drawing an analogy from a property not universal even among the animal creation in order to support an imaginary one among the vegetable tribes.\n\nWhen our author comes to explain the manner in which the coitus of vegetables is performed, he tells us, that the pollen may be seen lying upon the top of the stigma in most hermaphrodite flowers, where it is dissolved by the moisture which constantly adheres to that part; and after this dissolution, that the seminal aura contained in the pollen is absorbed by the stigma, and so conveyed directly to the seeds.\n\nThis account of the coitus lies open to two objections, 1st, Admitting that the pollen may be seen adhering to the stigmata of most hermaphrodite plants, and admitting likewise that moisture causes the pollen to burst and discharge a fulsome fluid, still a very natural question occurs with regard to the absorbing quality of the stigma. It is true, that the top of the stigma is generally covered with moisture. But does not this indicate that the proper office of the stigma is to secrete and propel rather than to absorb moisture? It will be the more readily admitted, that the vessels of the stigma are not suited to absorb, if it be considered that the moisture of the stigma is subjected to a constant evaporation, and of course must always stand in need of new supplies of this liquor, which can flow from no other source than the internal vessels of the stigma itself. It may indeed be allegedged, that the stigma is furnished with two sets of vessels, one for absorbing the seminal fluid, another for secreting the dissolving moisture. No body, however, has ever pretended to show that the stigma is possessed of any peculiar vessels for absorbing; whereas every man's eyes will convince him that it is possessed of secreting vessels: Hence, until the absorbing quality of the stigma be sufficiently proved, the possibility of an impregnation in this way must at least remain problematical.\n\n2dly, Linnaeus makes the appearance of the pollen adhering to the stigmata of hermaphrodite flowers an ocular demonstration of an actual coitus. Granting this to be an ocular demonstration of the coitus of vegetables, should not the pollen be likewise seen adhering to the stigmata of dioicous plants? But the appearance of pollen upon the stigmata of dioicous plants has never yet been discovered. We may, therefore, fairly conclude, that if the appearance of pollen upon the stigmata of hermaphrodite flowers be an ocular demonstration of the coitus or copulation of plants, the want of that appearance, or, no pollen's being ever seen upon the stigmata of dioicous flowers, must likewise be an ocular demonstration of the contrary!\n\nIn supporting theoretical opinions, mankind are extremely apt to render the subject ridiculous by pushing them too far. No man ever blundered more remarkably in this respect than Linnaeus. He is not satisfied with attributing life and a generative faculty to plants: He must likewise attempt to prove, that this generative faculty is so strong and vigorous, as to enable them to produce hybrids or mules, by means of unnatural mixtures.\n\nIn support of this notion, he tells us, that, when the antherae of a red tulip are cut off, and the ripe antherae of a white one are placed over the stigma of the red one, the seeds of the red tulip, by this artificial impregnation, will produce flowers streaked with red and white. Of this fact no body who knows anything of the nature of tulips, and the changes to which the colour of their flowers are liable, will entertain any doubt. But this change of colour is evidently ascribed to a wrong cause; for the same change would unquestionably happen whether the antherae of the white tulip had been placed over the stigma of the red one or not. When tulips blow for the first time, their petals are generally of one uniform colour. For several succeeding seasons this original colour continues to vary, in so much that, by certain methods of culture, the colour of the flower may be varied without end. Linnaeus, in his systematic works, wisely cautions his readers not to found any distinctions upon the colour of plants, which, he observes, is subject to such numberless alterations from culture, soil, and other casual incidents, that it can never furnish the botanist with any permanent or uniform marks. With what propriety, then, Linnaeus attributes the change in the colour of this tulip to his artificial impregnation, is submitted to the consideration of his warmest admirers.\n\nThe first hint of mules was taken from a plant the figure and disposition of whose leaves, &c., resembled the antirrhinum linaria, or common yellow toad-flax; but attended with this peculiarity, that its parts of fructification were entirely dissimilar. Linnaeus, when the plant was first presented to him, imagined it to be some kind\nof deception. But, after a more accurate examination, the notion of a furious issue opportunely came to his aid. The thought pleased him on a double account: It had a direct tendency to corroborate his favourite hypothesis, and laid the foundation of another still more extravagant. Now, thinks he, by this ineffable discovery, we shall be enabled to take a dry and rigid plant from the mountain's top, make it copulate with a moist and spongy aquatic, and their offspring will participate of the rigidity and hardness of the former, together with the moisture and flaccidity of the latter; and hence mankind shall soon be blessed with an easy purchase of their united virtues when flourishing in the intermediate vale! More wonderful still, we shall cause the plants which dwell upon the frozen mountains of Greenland to intermarry with the more delicate and wayward inhabitants of the torrid zone; and the constitutions of their children shall be so moulded and attempered, that they will live most comfortably in every temperate clime!\u2014Not contented with extracting two theories out of this single plant, Linnaeus forms a third still more wild and fantastical: \"From this curious phenomenon,\" says he, \"it is natural to think, that only two species of each genus existed ab origine, and that all the variety of species which now appear are only the span of fortuitous commixtures!\"\n\nIf either the fortuitous or artificial copulation of two different species were capable of producing a third perfectly distinct from the other two, the number of species would be infinite. According to our author, every blast of wind, every butterfly, would daily produce hundreds of new species. Neither the gardener nor husbandman could purchase seeds with safety, unless they could discover, from inspection, whether they had been impregnated by the semen of the same, or of a different species. Linnaeus would have us to believe, not only that different species of the same genus copulate together, but even that genera belonging to different classes engender, and beget mules. For example, he makes the poterium hybridum a mule, begot by the agrimonia eupatoria upon the poterium sanguiforba. The agrimonia belongs to the dodecandra digynia class, and the poterium to the monoeia polyandria. Now, let any man seriously consider the unavoidable consequences that would follow on the supposition that this wanton prostitution of sexes really existed among vegetables. In the first place, it would be impossible to reduce botany to any regular system; for every season would produce such a troop of new and strange plants, as would confound every scheme or method of classification that ever was, or ever will be invented. A botanist, for instance, carefully collects and preserves the seeds of the poterium, in order to raise that plant next season; but, after sowing the seeds, to his utter astonishment, not a single poterium appears, but every one of them is metamorphosed into a species of agrimonia, a plant so totally different that it cannot even be arranged under the same class. Sadly, Linnaeus is obliged to confess, that his vegetable mules, are not subjected to that perverse law of nature, which cruelly prevents animal mules from propagating their species. On the contrary, his vegetable mules enjoy all the sweets of mutual embraces, and all the comforts that arise from a numerous progeny! It is a happy circumstance that the economy of nature is not influenced by the whims and caprices of those very ingenious and learned gentlemen whose heads are constantly hunting after hypothetical phantoms.\n\nThere is hardly a general theory of the economy of animals, or vegetables, which, on the supposition of its truth, would not in a very short time extirpate both animals and vegetables from the face of the earth. In the theory under consideration, we have not only mules produced by different genera and species, but these very mules successfully propagating their kinds, and subject to be metamorphosed ad infinitum by subsequent impregnations. This would be strange work indeed! How unlike the economy of nature!\u2014Let us take an example, and trace it through a few metamorphoses. A nettle receives an impregnation from an oak, the seed falls to the ground, a plant of a very uncouth aspect springs up; it is no longer a nettle, neither is it an oak; but then it makes an excellent mule! This mule next receives an impregnation from a turnip; the seed now brings forth neither a nettle, an oak, nor a common mule, but something so monstrous that no language can afford a name for it! These are a few of the consequences that would inevitably happen, if this theory of sexual embraces were really founded in nature.\n\nIt is natural to think, that no author would venture to publish a theory of this kind, without having previously made a great variety of successful experiments. If plants were really capable of unnatural commixtures, any person might make many hundred mules in the space of twelve months. But we can affirm with confidence, that Linnaeus never made a single vegetable mule in his life. He has indeed collected forty-seven plants which he calls mules. Why? not because they were produced by an artificial or fortuitous impregnation; but because the leaves, stem, or parts of fructification have a resemblance to some other genus or species; even of these forty-seven he acknowledges that thirteen cannot be depended upon. The only attempts he has made to produce mules, have been confined to a few hermaphrodite plants: When endeavouring to impregnate a plant, Linnaeus proceeds in this manner: He lays hold of a hermaphrodite plant just before the flowers begin to blow; unfolds the petals, cuts off all the stamens, and then with his own hands performs the office of a male plant, by shaking the pollen of a different species over its pistillum. This operation being finished, he sows the seeds next season.\u2014Now, if Linnaeus's theory were just, these seeds should produce mules, or plants which cannot be referred to any of the two species upon which the experiment was made. But all the changes he has ever been able to produce by his manual impregnations are confined to the colour of the flower; a different streak or shade in the petals passes with him for a mule or mixture of the species, although, in other parts of his works, he positively declares, that generic or specific differences can never be taken from the colour of flowers, as it is constantly liable to a thousand changes from causes that are merely fortuitous.\n\nBut no experiment can be made with any degree of candor upon hermaphrodite flowers. No man can determine\nwith certainty what changes the young seeds may undergo, what injury they may suffer, by prematurely forcing open their petals and cutting off the stamens. If a pregnant animal be wounded, and in a part too intimately connected with the fetus, what reason have we to hope for a beautiful or well-proportioned offspring? One thing however is certain, that if the office of the flamina, as is alleged by the opposers of the sexes, be to separate and carry off noxious or excrementitious matter from the fruit, the retention of this matter would of itself introduce a change into the colour of the future plant; because in that case the seeds would not be properly purged or rectified, being prematurely deprived of the vessels destined for that purpose.\n\nWe shall now examine the famous story of Baal the gardener at Brentford, related above in the historical view of the controversy. Linnaeus accuses Baal's judges of ignorance, because they convicted him of fraud. But, would not any judge smile to hear himself branded with ignorance, or a partial administration of justice, merely because he paid no regard to the sexual commerce of plants in his decisions? It is happy for mankind that judges are obliged to decide according to law or equity, and not according to the hypothetical whims of the naturalist.\u2014But, even supposing Baal's judges to have had a perfect knowledge of the sexual commerce of vegetables, and to have been at full liberty to determine the point of law upon that medium, if they had acquitted Baal of fraud, or at least of negligence, we should have been inclined to doubt both of their integrity and ingenuity.\u2014It is acknowledged, that great quantities both of the brassica floridula and brassica longifolia were raised that season in Baal's garden. A seedman or gardener, in packing up many parcels of different seeds, by the simple error of putting a wrong mark upon any of the parcels, would produce a mistake similar to this of Baal's. But, whether the circumstance took its rise from negligence or fraud, belongs not to our present inquiry. Even upon Linnaeus's own principles, it is far from being clear of absurdity, how, by a casual impregnation, the species of a plant could be entirely changed. For, by the analogy of all animals, nay, taking our analogy from Linnaeus's vegetable mules, this fortuitous impregnation should have only produced a mule, or mixture of the two species, and not a perfect metamorphosis of either. Hence it may be fairly concluded, that this famous story, upon which the sexualists lay so much stress, instead of strengthening, tends to the final destruction of that hypothesis in support of which it was originally advanced.\n\nOf a similar nature is the story contained in Mylius's letter to Dr Watson. This gentleman writes to his correspondent, \"that a female palm tree grew many years in the garden belonging to the Royal Academy at Berlin, without producing any ripe or fertile fruit; that a male branch, with its flowers in full blow, was brought from Leipzig, which is about twenty German miles from Berlin, and suspended over the female; the result of this operation was, that the female, that very year, produced 100 ripe and fertile fruit. The same experiment being repeated the following year, 2000 ripe fruit were produced.\"\u2014Not to call Mylius's veracity in question, we shall allow the fact to be as he has related it: Nevertheless it is far from being satisfactory. Berlin is not the native climate of palm-trees. Mylius informs us, that this palm bore flowers and fruit for thirty years before the experiment was tried; but the fruit never came to full maturity. Now it is well known, that many exotic plants, particularly those of the larger kinds, seldom produce ripe fruit in a climate which is not adapted by nature for their nourishment, unless they are assisted by artificial culture, and have grown in that climate for a great number of years. Mylius's palm-tree had carried unripe fruit for the space of thirty years. Now, according to the usual course of exotics, it is natural to think that, during all this time, the fruit was every season making gradual advances towards perfection: It might so fall out, then, that at the very season when the male branch was suspended over the female, the plant had arrived at the highest degree of perfection it could ever acquire in the climate of Berlin; and of course, the accidental circumstance of suspending the male branch over it, at this critical period, might give rise to the deception of attributing the perfection and fertilization of the fruit to the presence of the male branch. The circumstance of the tree's bringing forth only 100 ripe fruit the first year, and 2000 the second, remarkably favours this account of the matter.\n\nHowever, be this as it will, the experiment is so very defective, that no conclusion can be drawn from it either for or against the sexual hypothesis. To convince any thinking person, that the fertility of this tree was solely owing to some impregnating virtue derived to it from the male branch, a branch should have been suspended over the female one year, omitted the next, and so on alternately for a course of years, or (as Linnaeus would express it), giving her a husband one year, and depriving her of that gratification the next: After treating the female in this manner for several years, if it had uniformly happened, that the fruit was fertile every year the male branch was suspended over it, and unfertile every year that the suspension of the male branch was omitted, then indeed there would have been a foundation for concluding, that there was some connection between the fertility of the fruit and the presence of the male branch. But as this necessary step has been neglected, the experiment is incomplete, and the conclusion drawn from it uncandid and precipitate.\n\nWe cannot conclude our remarks on this theory, without hazarding a few observations on the truly miraculous effects which Linnaeus attributes to the wind: In accounting for the impregnation of all the dioecious and most of the hermaphrodite plants, recourse is constantly had to the wind, which is said to convey the pollen of the male to the stigmata of the female. When the female again is at such a distance as to render the carriage of the pollen suspicious or impossible, our author is not discouraged by this circumstance, but confidently affirms, that some insect has been rummaging amongst the stamens of the male, carries off a quantity of the pollen adhering to its legs, and, unconscious of its precious load, flies from flower to flower till it arrives at the unmarried female, where...\nwhere stopping to take another bait, it luckily deposits some of this adhering pollen directly upon the stigma of the female.\n\nHere it is proper to observe, that generation is one of the capital, and indeed one of the most important laws of nature that we are acquainted with. The laws of nature are all fixed, steady, and uniform in their operation. None of the effects produced by them are subject to those uncertainties which always result from chance or any fortuitous train of circumstances. But is there anything in nature more unfettered, deftory, and capricious, than the direction and motions of the wind? Can we form a conception of anything more casual and fortuitous than the wild and wayward paths of insects? The very supposition, therefore, that nature has left the generation of at least a tenth part of the whole vegetable tribes to these accidental causes, must be unphilosophical, whimsical, and absurd. We will be the more readily convinced of the absurdity of this doctrine, when it is considered that many of the monocotyledonous and dioecious plants are of the utmost importance to the human race, and the consequent impropriety that the fructification of these should be subject to the sport of the winds.\n\nAfter all, it requires the utmost stretch of fancy to conceive the possibility of a regular impregnation by means of the wind, even when the male and female are within 500 yards of each other, which is a much more favourable supposition than two, three, or according to some authors, a dozen of miles. Conceive then a male and female hemp, or any other dioecious plant, growing 500 yards asunder. Let the male and female flowers, which, by the by, is not always the case, blow at the same time. Well, the anthers are fully ripe; the pollen is discharged; and the stigma, as our author expresses it, gaping wide for its reception. Now, even this favourable supposition is subject to so many accidents, and pregnant with such a troop of improbabilities, that it is absolutely impossible, upon any principles of belief hitherto invented, to be fully persuaded that the pollen, in such circumstances, can be thus conveyed on the wings of the wind, directly to the stigmas, a point in most plants just not invisible.\u2014To accomplish a regular impregnation in this way, whenever the anthers are ripe, the wind must blow in a direct line from the male to the female; if the blast be too strong, it will overshoot the mark; if too weak, it will fall short of it; if any vegetable or other body higher than the plants themselves intervene, the progress of the pollen will be intercepted;\u2014if it rains, the pollen will be beat to the ground;\u2014the least tremor of the air, or smaller blast reflected from any other quarter, will infallibly alter the direction of this fluctuating pollen.\u2014Nay, supposing Linnaeus, or any other expert botanist, should take his station by the male plant, having his pockets loaded with pollen; suppose him further to take every advantage of wind and weather, and aiming at the female, let him, for hours together, throw at her repeated handfuls of this fructifying pollen, it is a thousand to one, if, at the distance of 500 yards, a single grain of pollen would touch any part of the female, and many millions to one against its falling directly upon the stigmas of her respective flowers. In a word, this theory of impregnation by the wind, is a palpable refuge of ignorance, invented with a view to account for the fructification of dioecious plants, which Linnaeus knew to be a formidable barrier standing in opposition to the sexual hypothesis. How far that obstacle is removed by this vague subterfuge, is submitted to the judgment of every candid inquirer.\n\nUpon the whole, we have endeavoured to show, that every fact or experiment Linnaeus has employed to support his theory of the procreation of vegetables by means of sexual embraces, is either false, or accidental; and that the conclusions drawn from them are unnatural, and often strained to such a pitch of extravagance as renders them truly ridiculous.\n\nThe only argument that now remains to be examined, is drawn from the analogy between animals and vegetables. That many beautiful analogies may be traced between the animal and vegetable, is an undeniable truth. But, in reasoning upon a physical subject, which admits of a clear determination by experiment, to trust solely or chiefly to analogical deductions, is an evident mark either of a bad reasoner or an unstable hypothesis. The very nature of analogy presupposes some radical difference in the subjects between which the resemblance subsists. If the analogy be supported by facts and experiments, they mutually strengthen the evidence. But, if the analogy be not supported by facts and experiments, or, if the experiments contradict the analogy, which is the case with the theory under consideration; in either of these instances the analogy is carried beyond its proper limits, and affords no argument in favour of the hypothesis. Without the concurrence of facts, how can we be certain but that the very property we contend for constitutes the essential difference between the two subjects? Without facts, how can we be certain but that generation by the intercourse of sexes is the identical characteristic by which an animal and vegetable are distinguished? These principles are applicable even in the case of a perfect and uniform analogy, but acquire an accumulated force when the analogy is partial and incomplete, which is evidently the case with regard to the sexual commerce of vegetables.\n\nFor example, to complete the analogy in dioecious plants, a male should be uniformly found growing by the side of the female; and besides, at the age of puberty, or as soon as the anthers come to maturity, the male flower should be situated in such a manner, that the pollen could not possibly miss the stigmas of the female flowers, from whatever quarter the wind might blow: the same thing should take place with regard to the monoecious flowers. But this is not the analogy presented to us by nature. On the contrary, the males and females seldom grow in the neighbourhood of each other. Nothing is more common than to meet with large beds of males growing in one place, and large beds of females at the distance of some miles from them, pointing out, as it were, that no necessary connection, no mutual affection, no natural dependence subsisted between these males and females; but rather that nature intended, for some purpose or other, that they should be kept at a distance.\n\nFurther, the sexualists, in support of their theory, are\nare obliged to have recourse to the unpardonable impropriety of employing a double analogy, the one betwixt the animal and vegetable, the other betwixt two different tribes of vegetables. In order to account for the propagation of the muci, fungi, and, in a word, the whole cryptogamia clas, whose parts of generation are either wanting altogether, or invisible to our eye-sight, Linnaeus maintains, that, this circumstance notwithstanding, they propagate their species by a regular and uniform commerce of sexes. \"As it has been proven (says he) that all those plants whose organs of generations are visible, propagate their species by male and female embraces; therefore all those whose organs are less subject to our observation, must likewise propagate in the same way.\" Before such reasoning as this can admit even of a decent apology, before the sexualists attempt to shew that such plants enjoy the faculty of generation, it is incumbent on them to prove that they are possessed of generating organs.\n\nAccording to the doctrine of sexes in vegetables, another capital defect, or rather redundancy, occurs in the analogy between the animal and vegetable. It is one of the most benevolent and useful laws in nature, that mules, or such animals as are produced by the unnatural commixtures of two different kinds, are deprived of the capacity of propagating their monstrous species. It is true, Linnaeus's mules are not obliged to comply with this law; they are not animal but vegetable mules; and consequently may freely transmit their monstrous issue to posterity! As they are not objects of rewards or punishments, they cannot be answerable for the horrid consequences of turning the whole vegetable world into confusion, and covering the face of the earth with monsters horrible to behold!\n\nIt is a trite observation, that no fault is more common among bad writers than to render their arguments ridiculous by hunting down metaphors or analogies till every shadow of resemblance be lost. It is equally true, that this blunder occurs in almost every page of Linnaeus's works. But it is peculiarly unlucky when an analogy is of such a nature that it necessarily runs into obscenity when treated in this manner. In pursuing a sexual analogy, the utmost delicacy of expression is required. This however is exceedingly difficult, especially when the analogy is pushed beyond its natural limits. But, in perusing the Spongia Plantarum, one would be tempted to think, that the author had more reasons than one for reviling this analogy so highly. In many parts of this treatise, there is such a degree of indelicacy in the expression as cannot be exceeded by the most obscene romance-writer. For example, in p. 103, he says, \"The calyx is the bride-chamber in which the stamens and pistils solemnize their nuptials;\" \"Vel, si mavis CUNNUS, seu LABIA ejusdem, inter quae organa genitalia masculina & feminina, delicatissime illae partes, foventur & ab externis injuriis muniantur!\"\u2014Corolla est auleum, vel potius nymph\u00e6!\u2014Filamenta sunt vasa spermatica, quibus succus ex planta secretus in antheras transfertur!\u2014Anther\u00e6 fent Testiculi.\u2014Pollen, seu pulvis antherarum, geniturae & vernicul\u00e6 seminalibus responderet.\u2014Stigma est vulva, in qua agit genitura maris, qu\u00e6que hanc excipit.\u2014Stylus est vagina, vel potius pars illa qu\u00e6 tuba Fallopliana respondet.\u2014Germen est ovarium; continet etiam femina subvanea seu non fecundata ante copulam.\u2014Pericarpium est ovarium fecundatum.\"\u2014In p. 90, &c., we meet with virginea vulva lacteis hians\u2014ystra vener\u00e6 agitata, pistillum stigmatis biat, rapacis instar Draconis, nil nisi masculinum pulverem affectans.\" &c. It is impossible to do justice to these expressions in any translation.\n\nBesides the obscenity of these passages, it would be no difficult task to show that the analogies are entirely without foundation. The valix is made to represent no less than three things of very opposite natures; first, it is analogous to the chamber of the bride, then to the female organ, and last of all to the Labia. What analogy is there betwixt the corolla of a plant and the nymph\u00e6 of an animal? Where is the analogy between the pollen and the animalcul\u00e6 in femin\u00e6 masculino? &c.\n\nThere is not any science which has so little connection with theory as botany. Theory may perplex and confound, but never can have the least tendency to assist the botanic student. A man would not naturally expect to meet with disgusting strokes of obscenity in a system of botany. But it is a certain fact, that obscenity is the very basis of the Linnaean system. The names of his classes, orders, &c., convey often the vilest and most unnatural ideas. For example, diandra, the name of his second clas, is thus explained by Linnaeus, \"Mariti duo in coniugio; seu stamina duo in flore hermaphrodito;\" i.e. one female married to two males; or two stamens in a hermaphrodite flower. The number of males goes on increasing till the 13th clas, the plants belonging to which are said to have from 20 to 1000 husbands to one wife!\u2014We might ask Linnaeus, where is the analogy in this supposition? The syngenesia clas is thus defined by Linnaeus: \"Mariti genitalibus sedibus constituere; seu stamina antheris in cylindrum coacta; i.e. the males have made a covenant with their testes; or the stamens are united by the anthers in the form of a cylinder. The characters of the orders are still worse. Polygamia frustans, the name of an order of the syngenesia clas, is thus defined: \"Frustans di\u00e6 citur, cum femin\u00e6 maritato, fertiles sunt, et speciem propagare qu\u00e6cunt; caltr\u00e6, impregnari nequeant.\" Men or philosophers can smile at the nonsense and absurdity of such obscene gibberish; but it is easy to guess what effects it may have upon the young and thoughtless.\n\nBut the bad tendency upon morals is not the only evil produced by the sexual theory. It has loaded the best system of botany that has hitherto been invented, with a profusion of foolish and often unintelligible terms, which throw an obscurity upon the science, obstruct the progress of the learner, and deter many from ever entering upon the study.\n\nUpon the whole, we must conclude, that the distinction of sexes among vegetables has no foundation in nature; or, at least, that the facts and arguments employed in support of this doctrine, when examined with any degree of philosophical accuracy, are totally insufficient to establish it.","sp":764,"ep":785},{"h":"RHOMBOIDES","t":"This muscle is a thin, broad, and obliquely square fleathy plane, situated between the basis of the scapula and the spina dorsi; and it is from its figure that it has been termed rhomboides.\n\nIt may be divided into two portions, one superior, the other inferior, which sometimes appear separate. The superior portion is fixed, by an insertion wholly fleathy, in the two or three lowest spinal apophyses of the neck, and partly in the posterior cervical ligament. The inferior portion is fixed, by a tendinous plane, in the three or four uppermost spinal apophyses of the back.\n\nThese two portions, of which the inferior is by much the broadest, being united, are inserted in the edge of the basis scapulae, from the small triangular space to the inferior angle, the superior portion covering a small part of the insertion of the angularis.\nThis whole muscle is covered by the trapezius, and covers immediately the serratus posterior superior, being joined to each of these muscles by a filamentary or cellular substance.\n\nAngularis, vulgo Levator Scapulae Proprius.\n\nThis is a long, and pretty thick muscle, about two fingers in breadth, lying above the superior angle of the scapula, along the posterior lateral part of the neck of that bone.\n\nIt is inserted above in the extremities of the transverse apophyses of the four first vertebrae of the neck, by four fleshy branches, ending in short tendons; sometimes the second, sometimes the third, or both, and sometimes the fourth of these branches, is wanting; these defects being made up by the largeness of the rest.\n\nFrom thence these branches run down a little obliquely, and then uniting together, they are inserted in the superior angle of the scapula, and in the edge of its basis, from thence to the small triangular space, being there covered a little by the rhomboides.\n\nThis muscle is easily divided into two through its whole length. It is covered by the trapezius, and its insertions in the neck are sometimes mixed with those of the neighbouring muscles.\n\nPectoralis Minor.\n\nThis is a small fleshy muscle, something of a triangular shape, situated at the superior, lateral, and anterior part of the thorax.\n\nBy its basis it is inserted in the external labium of the upper edge of the second, third, fourth, and fifth true ribs; near their union with the cartilages, by the same number of digitations or separate fleshy portions, because of the intervals between the ribs; and for that reason it has been called serratus minor anticus.\n\nFrom thence these portions run up, more or less, obliquely toward the shoulder, and form a fleshy belly, which contracts as it passes before the two first ribs, and then becoming a short, flat, and broad tendon, is inserted in the upper part of the apophysis coracoides of the scapula, reaching all the way to the point of that process.\n\nThis muscle is covered by the pectoralis major, and adheres very closely to the external intercostal muscles.\n\nSerratus Major.\n\nThis is a broad, fleshy, and pretty thick muscle, lying on the lateral part of the thorax, between the ribs and scapula, by which it is covered. Its figure is that of an irregular square, its greatest breadth being in the back-part, where it terminates by digitations of unequal lengths, in a radiated disposition, their extremities describing an arch or curve; and from these digitations its name is taken.\n\nIt is inserted backward in the internal labium of all the basis of the scapula, from the superior to the inferior angle. From thence running forward wholly fleshy, it increases gradually in breadth, and is inserted in all the true ribs, and often in one or two of the false ribs, by the same number of digitations.\n\nSubclavius.\n\nThis is a small oblong muscle, lying between the clavicle and first rib. It is fixed by one end in all the middle lower portion of the clavicle, at the distance of about an inch from each extremity; and by the other in the cartilage and a small part of the bone of the first rib. It seems likewise to adhere to the extremity of the clavicle next the sternum, by a kind of broad thin ligament.\n\nUses of the Muscles which move the Bones of the Shoulder on the Trunk.\n\nThe mechanism of the scapula, in relation to its motions and changes of situation, is very different from that of all the other bones of the body, except the os hyoides. All the other bones have solid fulcra or fixed points, on which they are either moved or fixed by the muscles; but the motions of the scapula, its changes of situation, and its continuance in any one given attitude, are brought about without the help of any solid fulcrum. The muscles alone sustain it and brace it down, in all its different motions and situations.\n\nThe scapula has this peculiarity likewise belonging to it, that it is the fulcrum and basis of all the motions of the os humeri, of some motions of the fore-arm, and even of all the most violent efforts made with these bones, without being itself either moved or fixed on any solid basis.\n\nThe use of the trapezius is to raise the shoulder, and to keep it from sinking.\n\nThe serratus major raises the shoulder or top of the scapula, brings it forward, and hinders it from sinking. In all these, it is the principal actor; and it is impossible to conceive how labourers raise and support, by the shoulder alone, the heavy burdens with which they are loaded, without the affluence of this muscle.\n\nAccording to the insertions and direction of the rhomboides, its general use must be, to draw backward and upward the sub-spinal portion of the basis scapular.\n\nIt is likewise a moderator to the trapezius and serratus major, when they raise the shoulder, or carry the acromion upward; and it brings the scapula back to its natural situation, when the action of these muscles cease.\n\nThe angularis, by its insertion in the superior angle of the scapula, moderates the descent of that angle, while the trapezius and serratus major raise the acromion. Afterwards, when these two muscles cease to act, the angularis raises the superior angle, and by that means depresses the acromion.\n\nThe pectoralis minor assists the rhomboides and angularis, as moderators of the action of the trapezius and serratus major, in turning the point of the acromion upward, the superior angle downward, and the inferior angle forward.\n\nIt is likewise an assistant to the rhomboides and angularis, in restoring the scapula to its natural situation, when\nPart II.","sp":235,"ep":237},{"h":"RULE","t":"1. \"Transport all the terms that involve the unknown\nquantity to one side, and the known terms to the o-\nther side of the equation.\n\n2. \"If the square of the unknown quantity is multi-\nplied by any coefficient, you are to divide all the terms\nby that coefficient, that the coefficient of the square of\nthe unknown quantity may be unit.\n\n3. \"Add to both sides the square of half the coeffici-\nent prefixed to the unknown quantity itself, and the\nside of the equation that involves the unknown quan-\ntity will then be a complete square.\n\n4. \"Extract the square root from both sides of the\nequation; which you will find, on one side, always to\nbe the unknown quantity, with half the foresaid coef-\nficient subjoined to it; so that, by transposing this\nhalf, you may obtain the value of the unknown quan-\ntity expressed in known terms.\" Thus,\n\nSuppose \\( y^2 + ay = b \\)\n\nAdd the square of \\( \\frac{a}{2} \\) to both sides\n\n\\[\ny^2 + ay + \\frac{a^2}{4} = b + \\frac{a^2}{4}\n\\]\n\nExtract the root, \\( y + \\frac{a}{2} = \\pm \\sqrt{b + \\frac{a^2}{4}} \\)\n\nTranspose \\( \\frac{a}{2} \\), \\( y = \\pm \\sqrt{b + \\frac{a^2}{4}} - \\frac{a}{2} \\)\n\nThe square root of any quantity, as \\( +aa \\), may be\n\\( +a \\), or \\( -a \\); and hence, \"All quadratic equations ad-\nmit of two solutions.\" In the last example, after finding\nthat \\( y^2 + ay + \\frac{a^2}{4} = b + \\frac{a^2}{4} \\), it may be inferred that \\( y + \\frac{a}{2} \\)\n\\( = \\pm \\sqrt{b + \\frac{a^2}{4}} \\) or to \\( \\pm \\sqrt{b + \\frac{a^2}{4}} \\); since \\( \\sqrt{b + \\frac{a^2}{4}} \\times \\sqrt{b + \\frac{a^2}{4}} \\)\ngives \\( b + \\frac{a^2}{4} \\), as well as \\( \\pm \\sqrt{b + \\frac{a^2}{4}} \\times \\pm \\sqrt{b + \\frac{a^2}{4}} \\).\n\nThere are therefore two values of \\( y \\); the one gives \\( y = \\pm \\sqrt{b + \\frac{a^2}{4}} - \\frac{a}{2} \\), the other, \\( y = \\pm \\sqrt{b + \\frac{a^2}{4}} - \\frac{a}{2} \\).\n\nSince the squares of all quantities are positive, it\nis plain that \"the square root of a negative quantity is\nimaginary, and cannot be assigned.\" Therefore there are\nsome quadratic equations that cannot have any solution.\nFor example, suppose\n\n\\[\ny^2 - ay + 3a^2 = 0\n\\]\n\nthen \\( y^2 - ay = -3a^2 \\)\n\nadd \\( \\frac{a^2}{4} \\) to both, \\( y^2 - ay + \\frac{a^2}{4} = 3a^2 + \\frac{a^2}{4} \\)\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{11a^2}{4}\n\\]\n\nextract the root, \\( y - \\frac{a}{2} = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{11a^2}{4}} \\)\n\nand \\( y = \\frac{a}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{11a^2}{4}} \\).\n\nwhence the two values of \\( y \\) must be imaginary or impossi-\nble, because the root of \\( -\\frac{11a^2}{4} \\) cannot possibly be af-\nfirmed.\n\nSuppose that the quadratic equation proposed to be\nresolved is \\( y^2 - ay = b \\)\n\nthen \\( y^2 - ay + \\frac{a^2}{4} = b + \\frac{a^2}{4} \\)\n\n\\( y - \\frac{a}{2} = \\pm \\sqrt{b + \\frac{a^2}{4}} \\)\n\nand \\( y = \\frac{a}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{b + \\frac{a^2}{4}} \\).

Whence, as, after subtracting \\( b \\) as often as possible from \\( a \\), the remainder \\( c \\) is measured by \\( x \\); and, after subtracting \\( c \\) as often as possible from \\( b \\), the remainder \\( d \\) is also measured by \\( x \\); so, for the same reason, if you subtract \\( d \\) as often as possible from \\( c \\), the remainder (if there be any) must still be measured by \\( x \\); and if you proceed, still subtracting every remainder from the preceding remainder, till you find some remainder, which, subtracted from the preceding, leaves no further remainder, but exactly measures it, this last remainder will still be measured by \\( x \\), any common measure of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nThe last of these remainders, viz., that which exactly measures the preceding remainder, must be a common measure of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\); suppose that \\( d \\) was this last remainder, and that it measured \\( e \\) by the units in \\( r \\), then shall \\( c = rd \\), and we shall have these equations,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na &= mb + c \\\\\nb &= nc + d \\\\\nc &= rd.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nNow it is plain that since \\( d \\) measures \\( c \\), it must also measure \\( nc \\), and therefore must measure \\( nc + d \\), or \\( b \\). And since it measures \\( b \\) and \\( c \\), it must measure \\( mb + c \\), or \\( a \\); so that it must be a common measure of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). But further, it must be their greatest common measure; for every common measure of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) must measure \\( d \\), by the last article; and the greatest number that measures \\( d \\), is itself, which therefore is the greatest common measure of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nBut if, by continually subtracting every remainder from the preceding remainder, you can never find one that measures that which precedes it exactly, no quantity can be\nbe found that will measure both $a$ and $b$: and therefore they will be incommensurable to each other.\n\nFor if there was any common measure of these quantities, as $x$, it would necessarily measure all the remainders $c$, $d$, &c. For it would measure $a - mb$, or $c$, and consequently $b - nc$, or $d$, and so on; now these remainders decrease in such a manner, that they will necessarily become at length less than $x$, or any assignable quantity. For $c$ must be less than $\\frac{1}{2}x$; because $c$ is less than $b$, and therefore less than $mb$, and consequently less than $\\frac{1}{2}c + \\frac{1}{2}mb$, or $\\frac{1}{2}x$. In like manner $d$ must be less than $\\frac{1}{2}b$; for $d$ is less than $c$, and consequently less than $\\frac{1}{2}c + \\frac{1}{2}nc$, or $\\frac{1}{2}b$. The third remainder, in the same manner, must be less than $\\frac{1}{2}c$, which is itself less than $\\frac{1}{2}x$: Thus these remainders decrease, so that every one is less than the half of that which preceded it next but one. Now if from any quantity you take away more than its half, and from the remainder more than its half, and proceed in this manner, you will come at a remainder less than any assignable quantity. It appears therefore, that if the remainders $c$, $d$, &c. never end, they will become less than any assignable quantity, as $x$, which therefore cannot possibly measure them, and therefore cannot be a common measure of $a$ and $b$.\n\nIn the same way the greatest common measure of two numbers is discovered. Unit is a common measure of all integer numbers, and two numbers are said to be prime to each other when they have no greater common measure than unit; such as $9$ and $25$. Such always are the least numbers that can be assumed in any given proportion; for if these had any common measure, then the quotients that would arise by dividing them by that common measure would be in the same proportion, and, being less than the numbers themselves, these numbers would not be the least in the same proportion; against the supposition.\n\nThe least numbers in any proportion always measure any other numbers that are in the same proportion. Suppose $a$ and $b$ to be the least of all integer numbers in the same proportion, and that $c$ and $d$ are other numbers in that proportion, then will $a$ measure $c$, and $b$ measure $d$.\n\nFor if $a$ and $b$ are not aliquot parts of $c$ and $d$, then they must contain the same number of the same kind of parts of $c$ and $d$; and therefore dividing $a$ into parts of $c$, and $b$ into an equal number of like parts of $d$, and calling one of the first $m$, and one of the latter $n$; then as $m$ is to $n$, so will the sum of all the $m$'s be to the sum of all the $n$'s; that is, $m : n :: a : b$, therefore $a$ and $b$ will not be the least in the same proportion; against the supposition. Therefore $a$ and $b$ must be aliquot parts of $c$ and $d$. Hence we see that numbers which are prime to each other are the least in the same proportion; for if there were others in the same proportion less than them, these would measure them by the same number, which therefore would be their common measure against the supposition, for we supposed them to be prime to each other.\n\nIf two numbers $a$ and $b$ are prime to one another, and a third number $c$ measures one of them $a$, it will be prime to the other $b$. For if $c$ and $b$ were not prime to each other, they would have a common measure, which, because it would measure $c$, would also measure $a$, which is measured by $c$, therefore $a$ and $b$ would have a common measure, against the supposition.\n\nIf two numbers $a$ and $b$ are prime to $c$, then shall their product $ab$ be also prime to $c$: For if you suppose them to have any common measure as $d$, and suppose that $d$ measures $ab$ by the units in $e$, so that $de = ab$, then shall $d : a :: b : e$. But since $d$ measures $c$, and $c$ is supposed to be prime to $a$, it follows that $d$ and $a$ are prime to each other; and therefore $d$ must measure $b$; and yet, since $d$ is supposed to measure $c$ which is prime to $b$, it follows that $d$ is also prime to $b$; that is, $d$ is prime to a number which it measures, which is absurd.\n\nIt follows from the last article, that if $a$ and $c$ are prime to each other, then $a^2$ will be prime to $c$: For by supposing that $a$ is equal to $b$, then $ab$ will be equal to $a^2$; and consequently $a^2$ will be prime to $c$. In the same manner $c^2$ will be prime to $a$.\n\nIf two numbers $a$ and $b$ are both prime to other two $c$, $d$, then shall the product $ab$ be prime to the product $cd$; for $ab$ will be prime to $c$ and also to $d$, and therefore, by the same article, $cd$ will be prime to $ab$.\n\nFrom this it follows, that if $a$ and $c$ are prime to each other, then shall $a^2$ be prime to $c^2$, by supposing, in the last, that $a = b$, and $c = d$. It is also evident that $a^3$ will be prime to $c^3$, and in general any power of $a$ to any power of $c$ whatsoever.\n\nAny two numbers, $a$ and $b$, being given, to find the least numbers that are in the same proportion with them, divide them by their greatest common measure $x$, and the quotients $c$ and $d$ shall be the least numbers in the same proportion with $a$ and $b$.\n\nFor if there could be any other numbers in that proportion less than $c$ and $d$, suppose them to be $e$ and $f$, and these being in the same proportion as $a$ and $b$ would measure them: And the number by which they would measure them, would be greater than $x$, because $e$ and $f$ are supposed less than $c$ and $d$, so that $x$ would not be the greatest common measure of $a$ and $b$; against the supposition.\n\nLet it be required to find the least number that any two given numbers, as $a$ and $b$, can measure. First, \"If they are prime to each other, then their product $ab$ is the least number which they can both measure.\"\n\nFor if they could measure a less number than $ab$ as $c$, suppose that $c$ is equal to $ma$, and to $nb$; and since $c$ is less than $ab$, therefore $ma$ will be less than $ab$, and $m$ less than $b$; and $nb$ being less than $ab$, it follows that $n$ must be less than $a$; but since $ma = nb$, and consequently $a : b :: n : m$, and $a$ and $b$ are prime to each other, it would follow that $a$ would measure $n$, and $b$ measure $m$, that is, a greater number would measure a less, which is absurd.\n\nBut if the numbers $a$ and $b$ are not prime to each other, and their greatest common measure is $x$, which measures $a$ by the units in $m$, and measures $b$ by the units in $n$, so that $a = mx$, and $b = nx$, then shall $an$ (which is equal to $bm$, because $a : b :: mx : nx ; m : n$, and therefore $an = bm$) be the least number that $a$ and $b$ can both measure. For if they could measure any number $c$ less than\nthan \\(na\\), so that \\(\\frac{a}{c}\\leq l\\), then \\(a : b : m : n : k : l\\); \nand because \\(x\\) is supposed to be the greatest common \nmeasure of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), it follows that \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are the least \nof all numbers in the same proportion; and therefore \\(m\\) measures \\(k\\), and \\(m\\) measures \\(l\\). But as \\(c\\) is supposed to be \nless than \\(na\\), that is, \\(a\\) less than \\(na\\), therefore \\(l\\) is less than \\(n\\), so that a greater would measure a lesser, \nwhich is absurd. Therefore \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) cannot measure any \nnumber less than \\(an\\); which they both measure, because \n\\(na = mb\\).\n\nIt follows from this reasoning, that if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) measure any quantity \\(c\\), the least quantity \\(na\\), which is measured by \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), will also measure \\(c\\). For if you suppose, as before, that \\(a = ka\\), you will find, that \\(n\\) must \nmeasure \\(l\\), and \\(na\\) must measure \\(la\\) or \\(c\\).\n\nLet \\(a\\) express any integer number, and \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\) any fraction reduced to its lowest terms, so that \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) may be prime to each other, and consequently \\(an + m\\) also prime to \\(n\\), it will follow that \\(an + m\\) will be prime to \\(n\\), and consequently \\(\\frac{an + m}{n}\\) will be a fraction in its least terms, \nand can never be equal to an integer number. Therefore the square of the mixt number \\(\\frac{an + m}{n}\\) is still a mixt number, and never an integer. In the same manner, the \ncube, biquadrate, or any power of a mixt number, is \nstill a mixt number, and never an integer. It follows \nfrom this, that the square root of an integer must be an \ninteger or an incommensurable. Suppose that the inte-\nger proposed is \\(B\\), and that the square root of it is less \nthan \\(a + 1\\), but greater than \\(a\\), then it must be an in-\ncommensurable; for if it is a commensurable, let it be \n\\(\\frac{an + m}{n}\\) where \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\) represents any fraction reduced to its \nleast terms; it would follow, that \\(\\frac{an + m}{n}\\) squared would \ngive an integer number \\(B\\), the contrary of which we have demonstrated.\n\nIt follows from the last article, that the square roots \nof all numbers but of \\(1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144,\\) etc. (which are the squares of the integer \nnumbers \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,\\) etc.) are incommensurables: after the same manner, the cube \nroots of all numbers but of the cubes of \\(1, 2, 3,\\) etc., 6, 7, 8, 9, etc. are incommensurables; and quantities \nthat are to one another in the proportion of such num-\nbers must also have their square roots or cube roots in-\ncommensurable.\n\nThe roots of such numbers being incommensurable are expressed therefore by placing the proper radical sign over them; thus, \\(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{6}, \\sqrt{7}, \\sqrt{8}, \\sqrt{10}, \\ldots\\) express numbers incommensurable with unit. \nThese numbers, though they are incommensurable them-\nselves with unit, are commensurable in power with it, \nbecause their powers are integers, that is, multiples of unit. They may also be commensurable sometimes \nwith one another, as the \\(\\sqrt{8}\\) and the \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), because \nthey are to one another as \\(2\\) to \\(1\\): And when they have a common measure, as \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is the common measure of \nboth, then their ratio is reduced to an expression in the \nleast terms, as that of commensurable quantities, by di-\nviding them by their greatest common measure. This \ncommon measure is found as in commensurable quan-\ntities, only the root of the common measure is to be made \ntheir common divisor. Thus, \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{12}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\sqrt{4} = 2,\\) and \n\\(\\frac{\\sqrt{18a}}{\\sqrt{2}} = 3\\sqrt{a}.\\)\n\nA rational quantity may be reduced to the form of \nany given surd, by raising the quantity to the power that \nis denominated by the name of the surd, and then fer-\nting the radical sign over it thus, \\(a = \\sqrt{a^1} = \\sqrt{a^3} = \\sqrt{a^4}\\)\n\\(\\sqrt{a^n} = a^m = \\frac{n}{m}\\), and \\(a = \\sqrt{16} = \\sqrt{64} = \\sqrt{256} = \\sqrt{1024} = \\frac{4^n}{n}\\).\n\nSurds may be considered as powers with fractional exponents, \"if they are reduced to others of the same va-\nlue that shall have the same radical sign, by reducing \nthese fractional exponents to fractions having the same \nvalue and a common denominator.\" Thus, \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{m}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{a}}{\\sqrt{m}},\\) and \\(\\frac{I}{n} = \\frac{m}{nm},\\) \\(\\frac{l}{n} = \\frac{n}{nm},\\) and therefore \\(\\sqrt{a}\\) and \n\\(\\sqrt{a}\\), reduced to the same radical sign, become \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{am}{nm}}\\)\nand \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{m}}\\). If you are to reduce \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) to \nthe same denominator, consider \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) as equal to \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\), the \n\\(\\sqrt{2}\\) as equal to \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), whose indices reduced to a common \ndenominator, you have \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\), and conse-\nquently \\(\\sqrt{3} = \\sqrt{3^2} = \\sqrt{27},\\) and \\(\\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{2^2} = \\sqrt{4};\\) so \nthat the proposed surds \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) are reduced to other \nequal surds \\(\\sqrt{27}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{4}\\), having a common radical \nsign.\n\nSurds of the same rational quantity are multiplied by \nadding their exponents, and divided by subtracting them;\nthus \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{m}} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{n}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{a}}{\\sqrt{m}} = \\frac{3 + x}{6 - x} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{a^5}};\\) and \n\\(\\frac{\\sqrt{a}}{\\sqrt{a}} = \\frac{a^3}{a^5} = \\frac{s}{s - s} = a^{3 - s} = \\sqrt{a^2}.\\)\n\nIf the surds are of different rational quantities, as \n\\(\\sqrt{a^3}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{b^2}\\), and have the same sign, \"multiply \nthese rational quantities into one another, or divide \nthem...\"\nthem by one another, and set the common radical sign over their product or quotient.\" Thus, \\( \\frac{2^4}{\\sqrt{a}^2} \\times \\frac{5^2}{\\sqrt{b}^3} = \\frac{\\sqrt{a^4}}{2a} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{b^2}}{a b^3} = \\frac{\\sqrt{a^4}}{a b^3} \\).\n\nIf the surds have not the same radical sign, \"reduce them to such as shall have the same radical sign, and proceed as before,\" \\( \\sqrt{a} \\times \\sqrt{b} = \\frac{\\sqrt{a^m b^n}}{\\sqrt{x}} \\).\n\nMultiply \\( \\sqrt{a^m} \\times \\sqrt{b^n} = \\frac{m n}{x^n} \\); \\( \\sqrt{2 \\times 3^2} = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{18}} \\). If the surds have any rational coefficients, their product or quotient must be prefixed; thus,\n\n\\( \\sqrt{2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\times \\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{18}} \\) is found.\n\nThe powers of surds are found as the powers of other quantities, \"by multiplying their exponents by the index of the power required;\" thus the square root of \\( \\frac{a^3}{b^2} \\):\n\n\\( \\frac{a^3}{b^2} \\times \\frac{b^2}{a^3} = a^3 = \\frac{a^3}{b^2} \\).\n\nOr you need only, in involving surds, \"raise the quantity under the radical sign to the power required, continuing the same radical sign; unless the index of that power is equal to the name of the surd, or a multiple of it, and in that case the power of the surd becomes 'rational'.\" Evolution is performed \"by dividing the fraction which is the exponent of the surd by the name of the root required.\" Thus the square root of \\( \\sqrt{a^4} \\) is \\( \\sqrt{a^4} \\), or \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{a^4}}{\\sqrt{a^4}} \\).\n\nThe surd \\( \\frac{a^m x^n}{a^{m-x}} = \\frac{a^m x^n}{a^{m-x}} \\), and in like manner, if a power of any quantity of the same name with the surd divides the quantity under the radical sign without a remainder, as here \\( a^m \\) divides \\( a^{m x} \\), and \\( 2^3 \\) the square of \\( 2^2 \\) divides \\( 7^2 \\) the quantity under the sign in \\( \\sqrt{7} \\) without a remainder, then place the root of that power rationally before the sign, and the quotient under the sign, and thus the surd will be reduced to a more simple expression.\n\nThus, \\( \\sqrt{75} = 5\\sqrt{3}; \\sqrt{48} = 3\\sqrt{16} = 3\\sqrt{3}; \\sqrt{81} = \\frac{5}{3}\\sqrt{27 \\times 3} \\).\n\nWhen surds by the last article are reduced to their least expressions, if they have the same irrational part, they are added or subtracted, \"by adding or subtracting their rational coefficients, and prefixing the sum or difference to the common irrational part.\" Thus,\n\n\\( \\sqrt{75 + 48} = \\sqrt{3 + 4\\sqrt{3}} = 9\\sqrt{3}; \\sqrt{31 + \\frac{\\sqrt{24}}{3} + 2\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{5}{3}\\sqrt{3} \\).\n\nCompound surds are such as consist of two or more joined together. The simple surds are commensurable in power, and by being multiplied into themselves give at length rational quantities; yet compound surds multiplied into themselves commonly give still irrational products. But when any compound surd is proposed, there is another compound surd which multiplied into it gives a rational product. Thus, \\( \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} \\) multiplied by \\( \\sqrt{a} - \\sqrt{b} \\) gives \\( a - b \\), and therefore the investigation of that surd which multiplied into the proposed surd will give a \"rational product,\" is made easy by the following theorems.\n\n**THEOREM I.**\n\nGenerally, if you multiply \\( \\frac{a^n - b^n}{a^n + b^n} \\) by \\( \\frac{a^n + b^n}{a^n + b^n} \\), \\( a^n - b^n \\) continued till the terms be in number equal to \\( \\frac{n}{m} \\), the product shall be \\( a^n - b^n \\); for\n\n\\( a^n - b^n = a^n - b^n = a^n + b^n + a^n - b^n = a^n - b^n \\)\n\n\\( a^n - b^n = a^n - b^n \\)\n\n\\( a^n + b^n + a^n - b^n + a^n + b^n + a^n - b^n = a^n - b^n \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( a^n + b^n = a^n - b^n \\).\n\n**THEOREM II.**\n\n\\( a^n - b^n + a^n - b^n + a^n - b^n = a^n - b^n \\),\n\nmultiplied by \\( \\frac{a^n + b^n}{a^n + b^n} \\) gives \\( a^n + b^n \\), which is demonstrated as the other. Here the sign of \\( b^n \\) is positive, when \\( \\frac{n}{m} \\) is an odd number.\n\nWhen any binomial surd is proposed, \"suppose the index of each number equal to \\( m \\), and let \\( n \\) be the least integer number that is measured by \\( m \\), then shall \\( a^n - b^n = a^n - b^n \\), &c., give a compound surd, which multiplied into the proposed surd \\( a^n + b^n \\) will give a rational product.\" Thus to find the surd which multiplied by \\( \\sqrt{a} - \\sqrt{b} \\), will give a rational quantity. Here \\( n = \\frac{1}{3} \\), and the least number which is measured by \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) is unit; let \\( n = 1 \\), then shall \\( a^n - b^n - \\frac{1}{3} \\) \\( = \\frac{1}{3}^{1} \\) \\( = \\frac{1}{a} \\) \\( = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n\\( \\sqrt{a^2} \\times \\sqrt{ab} \\times \\sqrt{b^2} = \\sqrt{a^2 ab b^2} = \\sqrt{a^3 b^3} \\), which multiplied by \\( \\sqrt{a} - \\sqrt{b} \\) gives \\( a - b \\).\n\nTo find the surd which multiplied by \\( \\sqrt{a} - \\sqrt{b} \\) \\( = \\frac{a^3 + b^3}{a - b} \\), gives a rational product. Here \\( n = \\frac{a^3 - b^3}{a^2 b - a^2 b} \\), and the product shall give \\( a^n + b^n \\); therefore \\( n \\) must be taken the least integer that shall give \\( \\frac{n}{m} \\) also an integer.\nDem. \\(a^n = an - mbl + an - m^2b^1 + \\ldots\\) arising will be that of the proposed quantity divided by the binomial surd, expressed in its least terms. Thus,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{5} - \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{5} + 3\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{5} + \\sqrt{2}}; \\\\\n\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{7} - \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{42} + \\sqrt{18}}{4}.\n\\]\n\nWhen the square root of a surd is required, it may be found nearly by extracting the root of a rational quantity that approximates to its value. Thus to find the square root of \\(3 + 2\\sqrt{2}\\), we first calculate \\(\\sqrt{2} = 1.41421\\); and therefore \\(3 + 2\\sqrt{2} = 5.82842\\), whose root is found to be nearly \\(2.41421\\). So that \\(\\sqrt{3 + 2\\sqrt{2}}\\) is nearly \\(2.41421\\).\n\nBut sometimes we may be able to express the roots of surds exactly by other surds; as in this example the square root of \\(3 + 2\\sqrt{2}\\) is \\(1 + \\sqrt{2}\\), for \\(1 + \\sqrt{2} \\times (1 + \\sqrt{2}) = 1 + 2\\sqrt{2} + 2 = 3 + 2\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nIn order to know when and how this may be found, let us suppose that \\(x + y\\) is a binomial surd, whose square will be \\(x^2 + y^2 + 2xy\\). If \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are quadratic surds, then \\(x^2 + y^2\\) will be rational, and \\(2xy\\) irrational; so that \\(2xy\\) shall always be less than \\(x^2 + y^2\\), because the difference is \\(x^2 + y^2 - 2xy = x - y\\) which is always positive.\n\nSuppose that a proposed surd consisting of a rational part \\(A\\), and an irrational part \\(B\\), coincides with this, then \\(x^2 + y^2 = A\\) and \\(xy = B\\): Therefore by what was said of equations, Chap. 12th,\n\n\\[y^2 = A - x^2 = \\frac{B^2}{4x^2}, \\text{ and therefore,} \\\\\nAx^2 - x^4 = \\frac{B^2}{4} \\text{ and } x^4 - Ax^2 + \\frac{B^2}{4} = 0;\\]\n\nfrom whence we have \\(x^2 = \\frac{A + \\sqrt{A^2 - B^2}}{2}\\) and \\(y^2 = \\frac{A - \\sqrt{A^2 - B^2}}{2}\\).\n\nTherefore when a quantity partly rational, partly irrational, is proposed to have its root extracted, call the rational part \\(A\\), the irrational \\(B\\), and the square of the greatest number of the root shall be \\(A + \\sqrt{A^2 - B^2}\\), and the square of the lesser part shall be \\(A - \\sqrt{A^2 - B^2}\\). And as often as the square root of \\(A^2 - B^2\\) can be extracted, the square root of the proposed binomial surd may be expressed itself as a binomial surd. For example, if \\(3 + 2\\sqrt{2}\\) is proposed, then \\(A = 3\\), \\(B = 2\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(A^2 - B^2 = 9 - 8 = 1\\).\n\nTherefore \\(x^2 = \\frac{A + \\sqrt{A^2 - B^2}}{2} = 2\\), and \\(y^2 = \\frac{A - \\sqrt{A^2 - B^2}}{2} = 1\\). Therefore \\(x + y = 1 + \\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nTo find the square root of \\(-1 + \\sqrt{-8}\\), suppose \\(A = -1\\), \\(B = \\sqrt{-8}\\), so that \\(A^2 - B^2 = 9\\) and \\(\\frac{A + \\sqrt{A^2 - B^2}}{2} = -1 + 3 = 1\\), and \\(\\frac{A - \\sqrt{A^2 - B^2}}{2} = -1 - 3 = -2\\), therefore the root required is \\(1 + \\sqrt{-2}\\).\nBut though \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are not quadratic surds or roots of integers, if they are the roots of like surds, as if they are equal to \\( \\sqrt{m} \\cdot \\sqrt{n} \\cdot z \\) and \\( \\sqrt{n} \\cdot \\sqrt{z} \\), where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are integers, then \\( A = m + n \\cdot \\sqrt{z} \\) and \\( B = \\frac{A}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{A^2 - B^2}}{2} \\).\n\nIf \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are equal to \\( \\sqrt{m} \\cdot \\sqrt{n} \\cdot z \\) and \\( \\sqrt{n} \\cdot \\sqrt{z} \\), then \\( x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = m \\cdot n \\cdot z + n \\cdot \\sqrt{m} \\cdot \\sqrt{n} \\cdot z \\). So that if \\( z \\) or \\( t \\) be not multiples one of the other, or of some number that measures them both by a square number, then will \\( A \\) itself be a binomial.\n\nLet \\( x + y + z \\) express any trinomial furd, its square \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2xy + 2xz + 2yz \\) may be supposed equal to \\( A + B \\) as before. But rather multiply any two radicals as \\( 2xy \\) by \\( 2xz \\), and divide by the third \\( 2yz \\) which gives the quotient \\( 2x^2 \\) rational, and double the square of the furd \\( x \\) required. The same rule serves when there are four quantities \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2xy + 2xz + 2yz + 2zx + 2zy \\); multiply \\( 2xy \\) by \\( 2xz \\), and the product \\( 4x^2y^2 \\) divided by \\( 2yz \\) gives \\( 2x^2 \\) a rational quotient, half the square of \\( 2x \\). In like manner \\( 2xy \\cdot 2yz = 4y^2xz \\), which divided by \\( 2xz \\) another member gives \\( 2y^2 \\), a rational quote, the half of the square of \\( 2y \\). In the same manner \\( z \\) and \\( s \\) may be found; and their sum \\( x + y + z + s \\), the square root of the septinomial \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2xy + 2xz + 2yz + 2zx + 2zy \\), discovered.\n\nFor example, to find the square root of \\( 10 + \\sqrt{24} + \\sqrt{40} + \\sqrt{60} \\); I try \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{24} \\times \\sqrt{40}}{\\sqrt{60}} \\), which I find to be \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{16}}{4} = 4 \\), the half of the square root of the double of which, viz., \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\sqrt{8} = \\sqrt{2} \\), is one member of the square root required; next \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{24} \\times \\sqrt{60}}{\\sqrt{40}} = 6 \\), the half of the square root of the double of which is \\( \\sqrt{3} \\) another member of the root required; lastly, \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{40} \\times \\sqrt{60}}{\\sqrt{24}} = 10 \\), which gives \\( \\sqrt{5} \\) for the third member of the root required; from which we conclude, that the square root of \\( 10 + \\sqrt{24} + \\sqrt{40} + \\sqrt{60} \\) is \\( \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{5} \\); and trying, you find it succeeds, since multiplied by itself it gives the proposed quadrinomial.\n\nFor extracting the higher roots of a binomial, whose two members being squared are commensurable numbers, there is the following.\n\n**Rule.** \"Let the quantity be \\( A + B \\), whereof \\( A \\) is the greater part, and \\( c \\) the exponent of the root required. Seek the least number \\( n \\) whose power \\( n^c \\) is divisible by \\( AA - BB \\), the quotient being \\( Q \\).\n\nCompute \\( \\sqrt{A + B} \\times \\sqrt{Q} \\) in the nearest integer number, which suppose to be \\( r \\). Divide \\( A + B \\) by its greatest rational divisor, and let the quotient be \\( s \\), and let \\( \\frac{r + \\frac{n}{2}}{2} \\), in the nearest integer number, be\n\n\"if the root of \\( A + B \\) can be extracted.\"\n\n**Exampl. I.** Thus to find the cube root of \\( \\sqrt{968} + 25 \\), we have \\( A^2 - B^2 = 343 \\), whose divisors are \\( 7, 7, 7 \\), whence \\( n = 7 \\), and \\( Q = 1 \\). Further, \\( A + B \\times \\sqrt{Q} \\), that is, \\( \\sqrt{968} + 25 \\) is a little more than \\( 56 \\), whose nearest cube root is \\( 4 \\). Therefore \\( r = 4 \\). Again, dividing \\( \\sqrt{968} \\) by its greatest rational divisor, we have \\( A \\times \\sqrt{Q} = 22 \\sqrt{2} \\), and the radical part \\( \\sqrt{2} = s \\); and \\( r + \\frac{n}{2} \\); or \\( \\frac{5}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\), in the nearest integers, is \\( 2 = t \\). And lastly, \\( ts = 2 \\sqrt{2} \\), \\( \\sqrt{t^2 - n} = 1 \\), and \\( \\sqrt{Q} = \\sqrt{1} = 1 \\). Whence \\( 2\\sqrt{2} + 1 \\) is the root, whose cube, upon trial, I find to be \\( \\sqrt{968} + 25 \\).\n\n**Exampl. II.** To find the cube root of \\( 68 - \\sqrt{4374} \\), we have \\( A^2 - B^2 = 250 \\), whose divisors are \\( 5, 5, 2 \\). Thence \\( n = 5 \\times 2 = 10 \\), and \\( Q = 4 \\), and \\( \\sqrt{A + B} \\times \\sqrt{Q} \\), or \\( \\sqrt{68} + \\sqrt{4374} \\times 2 \\) is nearly \\( 7 = r \\); again \\( A \\times \\sqrt{Q} \\), or \\( 68 \\times \\sqrt{4} = 136 \\times \\sqrt{1} \\), that is, \\( s = 1 \\), and \\( r + \\frac{n}{2} \\), or \\( \\frac{7 + 5}{2} \\), is nearly \\( 4 = t \\). Therefore \\( ts = 4 \\), \\( \\sqrt{t^2 - n} = \\sqrt{6} \\), and \\( \\sqrt{Q} = \\sqrt{4} = \\sqrt{2} \\), whence the root to be tried is \\( \\frac{4 - \\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\).\n\n**Chap. XIV. Of the Genesis and Resolution of Equations in general; and the number of Roots an Equation of any Degree may have.**\n\nAfter the same manner, as the higher powers are produced by the multiplication of the lower powers of the same root, equations of superior orders are generated by the multiplication of equations of inferior orders involving the same unknown quantity. And \"an equation of any dimension may be considered as produced by the multiplication of as many simple equations as it has dimensions, or of any other equations whatever, if the sum of their dimensions is equal to the dimension of that equation.\" Thus, any cubic equation may be conceived as generated by the multiplication of three simple equations, or of one quadratic and one simple equation. A biquadratic is generated by the multiplication of four simple equations, or of two quadratic equations, or, lastly, of one cubic and one simple equation.\n\nIf the equations which you suppose multiplied by one another are the same, then the equation generated will be nothing else but some power of those equations, and the operation is merely *involution*, of which we have treated already: and, when any such equation is given, the simple equation by whose multiplication it is produced is found by *evolution*, or the extraction of a root.\n\nBut when the equations that are supposed to be multiplied\ntiplied by each other are different, then other equations than powers are generated; which to resolve into the simple equations whence they are generated is a different operation from involution, and is what is called, the resolution of equations.\n\nBut as evolution is performed by observing and tracing back the steps of involution; so to discover the rules for the resolution of equations, we must carefully observe their generation.\n\nSuppose the unknown quantity to be \\( x \\), and its values in any simple equations to be \\( a, b, c, d \\), &c., then those simple equations, by bringing all the terms to one side, become \\( x-a=0 \\), \\( x-b=0 \\), \\( x-c=0 \\), &c. And, the product of any two of these, as \\( x-a \\times x-b=0 \\) will give a quadratic equation, or an equation of two dimensions. The product of any three of them, as \\( x-a \\times x-b \\times x-c=0 \\), will give a cubic equation, or one of three dimensions. The product of any four of them will give a biquadratic equation, or one of four dimensions, as \\( x-a \\times x-b \\times x-c \\times x-d=0 \\). And, in general, \"in the equation produced, the highest dimension of the unknown quantity will be equal to the number of simple equations that are multiplied by each other.\"\n\nWhen any equation, equivalent to this biquadratic \\( x-a \\times x-b \\times x-c \\times x-d=0 \\), is proposed to be resolved, the whole difficulty consists in finding the simple equations \\( x-a=0 \\), \\( x-b=0 \\), \\( x-c=0 \\), \\( x-d=0 \\), by whose multiplication it is produced; for each of these simple equations gives one of the values of \\( x \\), and one solution of the proposed equation. For, if any of the values of \\( x \\), deduced from those simple equations, be substituted in the proposed equation in place of \\( x \\), then all the terms of that equation will vanish, and the whole be found equal to nothing. Because, when it is supposed that \\( x=a \\), or \\( x=b \\), or \\( x=c \\), or \\( x=d \\), then the product \\( x-a \\times x-b \\times x-c \\times x-d \\) does vanish, because one of the factors is equal to nothing. There are therefore four suppositions that give \\( x-a \\times x-b \\times x-c \\times x-d=0 \\) according to the proposed equation; that is, there are four roots of the proposed equation. And after the same manner, \"any other equation admits of as many solutions as there are simple equations multiplied by one another that produce it, or, as many as there are units in the highest dimension of the unknown quantity in the proposed equation.\"\n\nBut as there are no other quantities whatsoever besides these four (\\( a, b, c, d \\)) that substituted in the product \\( x-a \\times x-b \\times x-c \\times x-d \\), in the place of \\( x \\), will make the product vanish; therefore the equation \\( x-a \\times x-b \\times x-c \\times x-d=0 \\), cannot possibly have more than these four roots, and cannot admit of more solutions than four. If you substitute in that product a quantity neither equal to \\( a \\), nor \\( b \\), nor \\( c \\), nor \\( d \\), which suppose \\( e \\), then since neither \\( e-a \\), \\( e-b \\), \\( e-c \\), nor \\( e-d \\) is equal to nothing; their product \\( e-a \\times e-b \\times e-c \\times e-d \\) cannot be equal to nothing, but must be some real product; and therefore there is no supposition beside one of the forelaid four that gives a just value of \\( x \\) according to the proposed equation. So that it can have no more than these four roots. And after the same manner it appears, that \"no equation can have more roots than it contains dimensions of the unknown quantity.\"\n\nTo make all this still plainer by an example, in numbers; suppose the equation to be resolved, to be \\( x^4-10x^3+35x^2-50x+24=0 \\), and that you discover that this equation is the same with the product of \\( x-1 \\times x-2 \\times x-3 \\times x-4 \\), then you certainly infer that the four values of \\( x \\) are 1, 2, 3, 4; seeing any of these numbers placed for \\( x \\) makes that product, and consequently \\( x^4-10x^3+35x^2-50x+24 \\), equal to nothing, according to the proposed equation. And it is certain that there can be no other values of \\( x \\) besides these four: since when you substitute any other number for \\( x \\) in those factors \\( x-1 \\), \\( x-2 \\), \\( x-3 \\), \\( x-4 \\), none of the factors vanish; and therefore their product cannot be equal to nothing, according to the equation.\n\nIt may be useful sometimes to consider equations as generated from others of an inferior sort besides simple ones. Thus a cubic equation may be conceived as generated from the quadratic \\( x^2-px+q=0 \\), and the simple equation \\( x-a=0 \\), multiplied by each other; whose product\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n&x^3 - px^2 + qx - q \\\\\n&- ax^2 + apx\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\\( = 0 \\) may express any cubic equation whose roots are the quantity (\\( a \\)) the value of \\( x \\) in the simple equation, and the two roots of the quadratic equation, viz. \\( \\frac{p+\\sqrt{p^2-4q}}{2} \\) and \\( \\frac{p-\\sqrt{p^2-4q}}{2} \\); as appears from Chap. 12. And, according as these roots are real or impossible, two of the roots of the cubic equation are real or impossible.\n\nIn the doctrine of involution, we shewed, that \"the square of any quantity, positive or negative, is always positive;\" and therefore \"the square root of a negative is impossible or imaginary.\" For example, the \\( \\sqrt{-a^2} \\) is either \\( +a \\), or \\( -a \\); but \\( \\sqrt{-a^2} \\) can neither be \\( +a \\) nor \\( -a \\), but must be imaginary. Hence is understood, that \"a quadratic equation may have no impossible expression in its coefficients; and yet, when it is resolved into the simple equations that produce it, they may involve impossible expressions.\" Thus, the quadratic equation \\( x^2+a^2=0 \\) has no impossible coefficient; but the simple equations from which it is produced, viz. \\( x+\\sqrt{-a^2}=0 \\), and \\( x-\\sqrt{-a^2}=0 \\), both involve an imaginary quantity; as the square root \\( -a^2 \\) is a real quantity, but its square root is imaginary. After the same manner, a biquadratic equation, when resolved, may give four simple equations, each of which may give an impossible value for the root: and the same may be said of any equation that can be produced from quadratic equations only, that is, whose dimensions are of the even numbers.\n\nBut, \"a cubic equation (which cannot be generated from quadratic equations only, but requires one simple equation besides to produce it) if none of its coefficients are impossible, will have, at least, one real root,\" the same with the root of the simple equation\nwhence it is produced. The square of an impossible quantity may be real, as the square of \\( \\sqrt{-a^2} \\) is \\(-a^2\\); but \"the cube of an impossible quantity is still impossible,\" as it still involves the square root of a negative:\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{-a^3} \\times \\sqrt{-a^3} \\times \\sqrt{-a^3} = \\sqrt{-a^9} = a^3 \\sqrt{-1}, \\]\n\nis plainly imaginary. From which it appears, that though two simple equations involving impossible expressions, multiplied by one another, may give a product where no impossible expression may appear; yet \"if three such simple equations be multiplied by each other, the impossible expression will not disappear in their product.\"\n\nAnd hence it is plain, that though a quadratic equation whose coefficients are all real may have its two roots impossible, yet \"a cubic equation whose coefficients are real cannot have all its three roots impossible.\"\n\nIn general, it appears, that the impossible expressions cannot disappear in the equation produced, but when their number is even; that there are never in any equations, whose coefficients are real quantities, single impossible roots, or an odd number of impossible roots, but \"that the roots become impossible in pairs, and that an equation of an odd number of dimensions has always one real root.\"\n\n\"The roots of equations are either positive or negative, according as the roots of the simple equations whence they are produced are positive or negative.\" If you suppose \\( x = -a, x = -b, x = -c, x = -d, \\) &c., then shall\n\n\\[ x + a = 0, \\quad x + b = 0, \\quad x + c = 0, \\quad x + d = 0; \\]\n\nand the equation\n\n\\[ x + a \\times x + b \\times x + c \\times x + d = 0 \\]\n\nwill have its roots, \\(-a, -b, -c, -d,\\) &c. negative.\n\nBut to know when the roots of equations are positive, and when negative, and how many there are of each kind, shall be explained in the next chapter.\n\n**Chap. XV. Of the Signs and Coefficients of Equations.**\n\nWhen any number of simple equations are multiplied by each other; it is obvious that the highest dimension of the unknown quantity in their product is equal to the number of those simple equations; and the term involving the highest dimension is called the first term of the equation generated by this multiplication. The term involving the next dimension of the unknown quantity, less than the greatest by unit, is called the second term of the equation; the term involving the next dimension of the unknown quantity, which is less than the greatest by two, the third term of the equation, &c.; and that term which involves no dimension of the unknown quantity, but is some known quantity, is called the last term of the equation.\n\n\"The number of terms is always greater than the highest dimension of the unknown quantity by unit.\" And when any term is wanting, an asterisk is marked in its place. The signs and coefficients of equations will be understood by considering the following table, where the simple equations \\( x = a, x = b, \\) &c., are multiplied by one another, and produce successively the higher equations.\n\nFrom the inspection of these equations it is plain, that the coefficient of the first term is unit.\n\nThe coefficient of the second term is the sum of all the roots (a, b, c, d, e,) having their signs changed.\n\nThe coefficient of the third term is the sum of all the products that can be made by multiplying any two of the roots (a, b; c, d; e,) by one another.\n\nThe coefficient of the fourth term is the sum of all the products that can be made by multiplying into one another any three of the roots, with their signs changed. And after the same manner all the other coefficients are formed.\n\nThe last term is always the product of all the roots having their signs changed, multiplied by one another.\n\nAlthough in the table such simple equations only are multiplied by one another as have positive roots, it is easy to see, that \"the coefficients will be formed according to the same rule when any of the simple equations have negative roots.\" And, in general, if \\( x^3 - px^2 + qx - r = 0 \\) represent any cubic equation, then shall \\( p \\) be the sum of the roots; \\( q \\) the sum of the products made by multiplying any two of them; \\( r \\) the product of all the three: and, if \\(-p, +q, -r, +s, -t, +u,\\) &c. be the coefficients of the 2d, 3d, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, &c. terms of any equation, then shall \\( p \\) be the sum of all the roots, \\( q \\) the sum of the products of any two, \\( r \\) the sum of the products of any three, \\( s \\) the sum of the products of any four, \\( t \\) the sum of the products of any five, \\( u \\) the sum of the products of any six, &c.\nWhen therefore any equation is proposed to be refolded, it is easy to find the sum of the roots, (for it is equal to the coefficient of the second term having its sign changed); or to find the sum of the products that can be made by multiplying any determinate number of them.\n\nBut it is also easy \"to find the sum of the squares, or \"of any powers, of the roots.\n\nThe sum of the squares is always \\( p^2 - 2q \\). For calling the sum of the squares \\( B \\), since the sum of the roots is \\( p \\); and \"the square of the sum of any quantities is \"always equal to the sum of their squares added to \"double the products that can be made by multiplying \"any two of them,\" therefore \\( p^2 = B + 2q \\), and consequently \\( B = p^2 - 2q \\). For example, \\( a + b + c = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + ac + bc \\); that is, \\( p^2 = B + 2q \\). And \\( a + b + c + d = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + 2ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd \\), that is, again, \\( p^2 = B + 2q \\), or \\( B = p^2 - 2q \\). And so for any other number of quantities. In general therefore, \"B\" the \"sum of the squares of the roots may always be found \"by subtracting \\( 2q \\) from \\( p^2 \\),\" the quantities \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) being always known, since they are the coefficients in the proposed equation.\n\n\"The sum of the cubes of the roots of any equation is equal to \\( p^3 - 3pq + 3r \\), or to \\( Bp - pq + 3r \\).\" For \\( B - q \\times p \\) gives always the excess of the sum of the cubes of any quantities above the triple sum of the products that can be made by multiplying any three of them.\n\nThus, \\( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - ab - ac - bc \\times a + b + c = (B - q \\times p) = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc \\). Therefore if the sum of the cubes is called \\( C \\), then shall \\( B - q \\times p = C - 3r \\), and \\( C = Bp - pq + 3r \\).\n\nAfter the same manner, if \\( D \\) be the sum of the 4th powers of the roots, you will find that \\( D = pC - qB + pr - 4s \\), and if \\( E \\) be the sum of the 5th powers, then shall \\( E = pD - qC + rB - ps + 5t \\). And after the same manner the sum of any powers of the roots may be found; the progression of these expressions of the sum of the powers being obvious.\n\nAs for the signs of the terms of the equation produced, it appears, from inspection, that the signs of all the terms in any equation in the table are alternately \\(+ \\) and \\(-\\): these equations are generated by multiplying continually \\( x - a, x - b, x - c, x - d, \\) &c., by one another. The first term is always some pure power of \\( x \\), and is positive; the second is a power of \\( x \\) multiplied by the quantities \\(-a, -b, -c, \\) &c. And since these are all negative, that term must therefore be negative. The third term has the products of any two of these quantities \\((-a, -b, -c, \\) &c.) for its coefficient; which products are all positive, because \\(-x\\) gives \\(+\\). For the like reason, the next coefficient, consisting of all the products made by multiplying any three of these quantities must be negative, and the next positive. So that the coefficients, in this case, will be positive and negative by turns. But, \"in this case the roots are all positive;\" since \\( x = a, x = b, x = c, x = d, x = e, \\) &c., are the assumed simple equations. It is plain then, that \"when all the roots are positive, the signs are alternately \\(+ \\) and \\(-\\).\"\n\nBut if the roots are all negative, then \\( x + ax + bx + cx + dx + \\ldots \\) will express the equation to be produced; all whose terms will plainly be positive; so that, \"when all the roots of an equation are negative, it is plain there will be no changes in the signs of the terms of that equation.\"\n\nIn general, \"there are as many positive roots in any equation as there are changes in the signs of the terms from \\(+ \\) to \\(-\\), or from \\(- \\) to \\(+\\); and the remaining roots are negative.\" The rule is general, if the impossible roots be allowed to be either positive or negative; and may be extended to all kinds of equations.\n\nIn quadratic equations, the two roots are either both positive, as in this\n\n\\[\n(x - a)(x - b) = x^2 - ax - ab = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhere there are two changes of the signs: Or they are both negative, as in this\n\n\\[\n(x + a)(x + b) = x^2 + ax + ab = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhere there is not any change of the signs: Or there is one positive and one negative, as in\n\n\\[\n(x - a)(x + b) = x^2 - ax + ab = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhere there is necessarily one change of the signs; because the first term is positive, and the last negative, and there can be but one change whether the 2d term be \\(+ \\) or \\(-\\).\n\nTherefore the rule given in the last paragraph extends to all quadratic equations.\n\nIn cubic equations, the roots may be,\n\n1\u00b0. All positive, as in this, \\( x - a \\times x - b \\times x - c = 0 \\), in which the signs are alternately \\(+ \\) and \\(-\\), as appears from the table; and there are three changes of the signs.\n\n2\u00b0. The roots may be all negative, as in the equation \\( x + a \\times x + b \\times x + c = 0 \\), where there can be no change of the signs. Or,\n\n3\u00b0. There may be two positive roots and one negative, as in the equation \\( x - a \\times x - b \\times x + c = 0 \\); which gives\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx^3 - ax^2 - bx^2 - cx &= 0 \\\\\n-ax^2 + bx^2 - cx &= 0 \\\\\n+bx^2 - cx &= 0 \\\\\n-cx &= 0\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHere there must be two changes of the signs; because if \\( a + b \\) is greater than \\( c \\), the second term must be negative, its coefficient being \\(-a - b + c\\).\n\nAnd if \\( a + b \\) is less than \\( c \\), then the third term must be negative, its coefficient \\(-ab - ac - bc(ab - cxa + b)\\) being in that case negative. And there cannot possibly be three changes of the signs, the first and last terms having the same sign.\n\n4\u00b0. There may be one positive root and two negative, as in the equation \\( x + a \\times x + b \\times x + c = 0 \\), which gives\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx^3 + ax^2 + bx^2 + cx &= 0 \\\\\n+ax^2 + bx^2 + cx &= 0 \\\\\n+bx^2 + cx &= 0 \\\\\n+cx &= 0\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nwhere\n\n* Because the rectangle \\( axb \\) is less than the square \\( a + b \\times a + b \\), and therefore much less than \\( a + b \\times c \\).\nwhere there must be always one change of the signs, since the first term is positive and the last negative. And there can be but one change of the signs, since if the second term is negative, or \\(a + b\\) less than \\(c\\), the third must be negative also, so that there will be but one change of the signs. Or, if the second term is affirmative, whatever the third term is, there will be but one change of the signs. It appears therefore, in general, that in cubic equations, there are as many affirmative roots as there are changes of the signs of the terms of the equation.\n\nThere are several conjectaries of what has been already demonstrated, that are of use in discovering the roots of equations. But before we proceed to that, it will be convenient to explain some transformations of equations, by which they may often be rendered more simple, and the investigation of their roots more easy.\n\n**Chap. XVI. Of the Transformation of Equations; and exterminating their intermediate Terms.**\n\nWe now proceed to explain the transformation of equations that are most useful: and, first, \"The affirmative roots of an equation are changed into negative roots of the same value, and the negative roots into affirmative, by only changing the signs of the terms alternately, beginning with the second.\" Thus, the roots of the equation \\(x^4 - x^3 - 19x^2 + 49x - 30 = 0\\) are \\(+1, +2, +3, -5\\); whereas the roots of the same equation having only the signs of the second and fourth terms changed, viz., \\(x^4 + x^3 - 19x^2 + 49x - 30 = 0\\) are \\(-1, -2, -3, +5\\).\n\nTo understand the reason of this rule, let us assume an equation, as \\(x^4 - ax^3 - bx^2 - cx - d = 0\\), whose roots are \\(+a, +b, +c, +d, +e, \\ldots\\), and another, having its roots of the same value, but affected with contrary signs, as \\(x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + dx + e = 0\\). It is plain, that the terms alternately, beginning from the first, are the same in both equations, and have the same sign, being products of an even number of the roots; the product of any two roots having the same sign as their product when both their signs are changed; as \\(+a \\times -b = -a \\times +b\\).\n\nBut the second terms, and all taken alternately from them, because their coefficients involve always the products of an odd number of the roots, will have contrary signs in the two equations. For example, the product of four, viz., \\(abcd\\), having the same sign in both, and one equation in the fifth term having \\(abcd + e\\), and the other \\(abcd - e\\), it follows, that their product \\(abcde\\) must have contrary signs in the two equations: these two equations therefore that have the same roots, but with contrary signs, have nothing different but the signs of the alternate terms, beginning with the second. From which it follows, \"that if any equation is given, and you change the signs of the alternate terms, beginning with the second, the new equation will have roots of the same value, but with contrary signs.\"\n\nIt is often very useful \"to transform an equation into another that shall have its roots greater or less than the roots of the proposed equation by some given difference.\"\n\nLet the equation proposed be the cubic \\(x^3 - px^2 + qx - r = 0\\). And let it be required to transform it into another equation whose roots shall be less than the roots of this equation by some given difference \\((e)\\), that is, suppose \\(y = x - e\\), and consequently \\(x = y + e\\); then, instead of \\(x\\) and its powers, substitute \\(y + e\\) and its powers, and there will arise this new equation,\n\n\\[\n(A) \\begin{cases}\ny^3 + 3ey^2 + 3e^2y + e^3 \\\\\n- py^2 - 2pey - pe^2 \\\\\n+ qy + qe \\\\\n- r\n\\end{cases} = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhose roots are less than the roots of the preceding equation by the difference \\((e)\\).\n\nIf it had been required to find an equation whose roots should be greater than those of the proposed equation by the quantity \\((e)\\), then we must have supposed \\(y = x + e\\), and consequently \\(x = y - e\\), and then the other equation would have had this form.\n\n\\[\n(B) \\begin{cases}\ny^3 - 3ey^2 + 3e^2y - e^3 \\\\\n- py^2 + 2pey - pe^2 \\\\\n+ qy - qe \\\\\n- r\n\\end{cases} = 0.\n\\]\n\nIf the proposed equation be in this form \\(x^3 + px^2 + qx + r = 0\\), then, by supposing \\(x = -y\\), there will arise an equation agreeing in all respects with the equation \\((A)\\), but that the second and fourth terms will have contrary signs.\n\nAnd by supposing \\(x = -e - y\\), there will arise an equation agreeing with \\((B)\\) in all respects, but that the second and fourth terms will have contrary signs to what they have in \\((B)\\).\n\nThe first of these suppositions gives this equation,\n\n\\[\n(C) \\begin{cases}\ny^3 - 3ey^2 + 3e^2y - e^3 \\\\\n+ py^2 - 2pey + pe^2 \\\\\n+ qy - qe \\\\\n+ r\n\\end{cases} = 0.\n\\]\n\nThe second supposition gives the equation,\n\n\\[\n(D) \\begin{cases}\ny^3 + 3ey^2 + 3e^2y + e^3 \\\\\n+ py^2 + 2pey + pe^2 \\\\\n+ qy + qe \\\\\n+ r\n\\end{cases} = 0.\n\\]\n\nThe first use of this transformation of equations is to show \"how the second (or other intermediate) term may be taken away out of an equation.\"\n\nIt is plain, that in the equation \\((A)\\) whose second term is \\(3e - pxy\\), if you suppose \\(e = \\frac{p}{3}\\), and consequently \\(3e - p = 0\\), then the second term will vanish.\n\nIn the equation \\((C)\\) whose second term is \\(-3e + pxy^2\\), supposing \\(e = \\frac{p}{3}\\), the second term also vanishes.\n\nNow the equation \\((A)\\) was deduced from \\(x^3 - px^2 + qx - r = 0\\), by supposing \\(y = x - e\\); and the equation \\((C)\\) was deduced from \\(x^3 + px^2 + qx + r = 0\\); by supposing \\(y = x + e\\). From which this rule may easily be deduced for exterminating the second term out of any cubic equation.\n\n**Rule.**\nRule. Add to the unknown quantity of the given equation the third part of the coefficient of the second term with its proper sign, viz., \\( \\frac{1}{2}p \\), and suppose this aggregate equal to a new unknown quantity \\( y \\). From this value of \\( y \\) find a value of \\( x \\) by transposition, and substitute this value of \\( x \\) and its powers in the given equation, and there will arise a new equation that shall want the second term.\n\nExample. Let it be required to exterminate the second term out of this equation, \\( x^3 - px^2 + 26x - 34 = 0 \\), suppose \\( x = 3y \\), or \\( y + 3 = x \\); and substituting according to the rule, you will find\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ny^3 + 9y^2 + 27y + 27 \\\\\n-9y^2 - 54y - 81 \\\\\n+26y + 78 \\\\\n-34 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\\[ y^3 * -y - 10 = 0. \\]\n\nIn which there is no term where \\( y \\) is of two dimensions, and an asterisk is placed in the room of the 2d term, to shew it is wanting.\n\nLet the equation proposed be of any number of dimensions represented by \\( n \\); and let the coefficient of the second term with its sign prefixed be \\( -p \\), then supposing \\( x = \\frac{p}{n} = y \\), and consequently \\( x = y + \\frac{p}{n} \\), and substituting this value for \\( x \\) in the given equation, there will arise a new equation that shall want the second term.\n\nIt is plain from what was demonstrated in chap. 15, that the sum of the roots of the proposed equation is \\( +p \\); and since we suppose \\( y = x - \\frac{p}{n} \\), it follows, that, in the new equation, each value of \\( y \\) will be less than the respective value of \\( x \\) by \\( \\frac{p}{n} \\); and, since the number of the roots is \\( n \\), it follows, that the sum of the values of \\( y \\) will be less than \\( +p \\), the sum of the values of \\( x \\), by \\( n \\times \\frac{p}{n} \\), the difference of any two roots, that is, by \\( +p \\); therefore the sum of the values of \\( y \\) will be \\( +p - p = 0 \\).\n\nBut the coefficient of the second term of the equation of \\( y \\) is the sum of the values of \\( y \\), viz., \\( +p - p \\), and therefore that coefficient is equal to nothing; and consequently, in the equation of \\( y \\), the second term vanishes. It follows then, that the second term may be exterminated out of any given equation by the following\n\nRule. Divide the coefficient of the second term of the proposed equation by the number of dimensions of the equation; and assuming a new unknown quantity \\( y \\), add to it the quotient having its sign changed. Then suppose this aggregate equal to \\( x \\) the unknown quantity in the proposed equation; and for \\( x \\) and its powers, substitute the aggregate and its powers, so shall the new equation that arises want its second term.\n\nIf the proposed equation is a quadratic, as \\( x^2 - px + q \\)\n\n\\[ y^2 + py + \\frac{1}{2}p^2 = 0, \\]\n\nthen, according to the rule, suppose \\( y + \\frac{1}{2}p = x \\), and substituting this value for \\( x \\), you will find,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ny^2 + py + \\frac{1}{2}p^2 \\\\\n- \\frac{1}{2}p^2 \\\\\n+ q \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\\[ y^2 * -\\frac{1}{2}p^2 + q = 0. \\]\n\nAnd from this example the use of exterminating the 2d term appears: for commonly the solution of the equation that wants the 2d term is more easy. And, if you can find the value of \\( y \\) from this new equation, it is easy to find the value of \\( x \\), by means of the equation \\( y + \\frac{1}{2}p = x \\).\n\nFor example,\n\nSince \\( y^2 + q - \\frac{1}{2}p^2 = 0 \\), it follows, that\n\n\\[ y^2 = \\frac{1}{2}p^2 - q, \\text{ and } y = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}p^2 - q}, \\text{ so that } \\]\n\n\\[ x = y + \\frac{1}{2}p = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}p^2 - q}; \\]\n\nwhich agrees with what we demonstrated, chap. 12.\n\nIf the proposed equation is a biquadratic, as \\( x^4 - px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = 0 \\), then, by supposing \\( x = \\frac{1}{2}p^2 - q \\), an equation shall arise having no second term. And if the proposed equation is of 5 dimensions, then you must suppose \\( x = \\frac{1}{2}p^2 \\). And so on.\n\nWhen the second term in any equation is wanting, it follows, that \"the equation has both affirmative and negative roots,\" and that \"the sum of the affirmative roots is equal to the sum of the negative roots:\" by which means the coefficient of the 2d term, which is the sum of all the roots of both sorts, vanishes, and makes the second term vanish.\n\nIn general, \"The coefficient of the 2d term is the difference between the sum of the affirmative roots and the sum of the negative roots:\" and the operations we have given serve only to diminish all the roots when the sum of the affirmative is greatest, or increase the roots when the sum of the negative is greatest, so as to balance them, and reduce them to an equality.\n\nIt is obvious, that in a quadratic equation that wants the second term, there must be one root affirmative and one negative; and these must be equal to one another.\n\nIn a cubic equation that wants the second term, there must be either two affirmative roots equal, taken together to a third root that must be negative; or, two negative equal to a third that must be positive.\n\n\"Let an equation \\( x^3 - px^2 + qx - r = 0 \\) be proposed, and let it be now required to exterminate the third term.\"\n\nBy supposing \\( y = x - e \\), the coefficient of the 3d term in the equation of \\( y \\) is found (see equation A) to be \\( 3e^2 - 2pe + q \\). Suppose that coefficient equal to nothing, and by resolving the quadratic equation \\( 3e^2 - 2pe + q = 0 \\), you will find the value of \\( e \\), which substituted for it in the equation \\( y = x - e \\), will shew how to transform the proposed equation into one that shall want the third term.\n\nThe quadratic \\( 3e^2 - 2pe + q = 0 \\), gives \\( e = \\frac{-p \\pm \\sqrt{p^2 - 3q}}{3} \\).\n\nSo that the proposed cubic will be transformed into an equation wanting the third term by supposing \\( y = x - \\frac{-p \\pm \\sqrt{p^2 - 3q}}{3} \\), or \\( y = x - \\frac{p \\pm \\sqrt{p^2 - 3q}}{3} \\).\nIf the proposed equation is of \\( n \\) dimensions, the value of \\( e \\), by which the 3rd term may be taken away, is had by resolving the quadratic equation \\( e^2 + \\frac{2p}{n} x + \\frac{-2q}{n(n-1)} = 0 \\), supposing \\( -p \\) and \\( +q \\) to be the coefficients of the 2nd and 3rd terms of the proposed equation.\n\nThe 4th term of any equation may be taken away by solving a cubic equation, which is the coefficient of the 4th term in the equation, when transformed, as in the former part of this chapter. The fifth term may be taken away by solving a biquadratic; and after the same manner, the other terms can be exterminated if there are any.\n\nThere are other transmutations of equations that, on some occasions, are useful.\n\nAn equation, as \\( x^3 - px^2 + qx - r = 0 \\), \"may be transformed into another that shall have its roots equal to the roots of this equation multiplied by a given quantity,\" as \\( f \\), by supposing \\( y = fx \\), and consequently \\( x = \\frac{y}{f} \\), and substituting this value for \\( x \\) in the proposed equation, there will arise \\( \\frac{y^3}{f^3} - \\frac{py^2}{f^2} + \\frac{qy}{f} - r = 0 \\), and multiplying all by \\( f^3 \\), \\( y^3 - py^2 + qy - f^3r = 0 \\), where the coefficient of the 2nd term of the proposed equation multiplied into \\( f \\), makes the coefficient of the 2nd term of the transformed equation; and the following coefficients are produced by the following coefficients of the proposed equation, (as \\( q, r, \\) &c.) multiplied into the powers of \\( f \\) (\\( f^2, f^3, \\) &c.).\n\nTherefore, \"to transform any equation into another whose roots shall be equal to the roots of the proposed equation multiplied by a given quantity (\\( f \\)), you need only multiply the terms of the proposed equation, beginning at the 2nd term, by \\( f, f^2, f^3, f^4, \\) &c., and putting \\( y \\) instead of \\( x \\), there will arise an equation having its roots equal to the roots of the proposed equation multiplied by (\\( f \\)) as required.\n\nThe transformation mentioned above is of use when the highest term of the equation has a coefficient different from unity; for, by it, the equation may be transformed into one that shall have the coefficient of the highest term unit.\n\nIf the equation proposed is \\( ax^3 - px^2 + qx - r = 0 \\), then transform the equation into one whose roots are equal to the roots of the proposed equation multiplied by (\\( a \\)). That is, suppose \\( y = ax \\) or \\( x = \\frac{y}{a} \\) and there will arise \\( ay^3 - py^2 + qy - ra = 0 \\); so that \\( y^3 - py^2 + qy - ra = 0 \\).\n\nFrom which we easily draw this\n\n**Rule.** Change the unknown quantity \\( x \\) into another \\( y \\), prefix no coefficient to the highest term, pass the 2nd, multiply the following terms, beginning with the 3rd, by \\( a, a^2, a^3, a^4, \\) &c. the powers of the coefficient of the highest term of the proposed equation, respectively.\n\nThus the equation \\( 3x^3 - 13x^2 + 14x + 16 = 0 \\), is transformed into the equation \\( y^3 - 13y^2 + 14y + 16 = 0 \\).\n\nThen finding the roots of this equation, it will easily be discovered what are the roots of the proposed equation, since \\( 3x = y \\), or \\( x = \\frac{y}{3} \\). And therefore, since one of the values of \\( y \\) is \\(-2\\), it follows, that one of the values of \\( x \\) is \\(-\\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\nBy the last rule, \"an equation is easily cleared of fractions.\" Suppose the equation proposed is \\( x^3 - \\frac{p}{m} x^2 + \\frac{q}{n} x - \\frac{r}{e} = 0 \\). Multiply all the terms by the product of the denominators, you find \\( mnex^3 - mx^2 + mneqx - mnr = 0 \\).\n\nThen (as above) transforming the equation into one that shall have unit for the coefficient of the highest term, you find \\( y^3 - npxy^2 + mneqxy - mnre = 0 \\).\n\nOr, neglecting the denominator of the last term \\( \\frac{r}{e} \\), you need only multiply all the equation by \\( mn \\), which will give \\( mnex^3 - npxy^2 + mneqxy - mnre = 0 \\). And then \\( y^3 - npxy^2 + mneqxy - mnre = 0 \\).\n\nNow after the values of \\( y \\) are found, it will be easy to discover the values of \\( x \\); since, in the first case, \\( x = \\frac{y}{mn} \\); in the second, \\( x = \\frac{y}{mn} \\).\n\nFor example, the equation \\( x^3 - \\frac{4}{3}x^2 - \\frac{1}{3}x - \\frac{1}{3} = 0 \\), is first reduced to this form \\( 3x^3 - 4x^2 - x - 1 = 0 \\), and then transformed into \\( y^3 - 12y^2 - 146 = 0 \\).\n\nSometimes, by these transformations, \"surds are taken away.\" As for example,\n\nThe equation \\( x^3 - \\frac{p}{a}ax^2 + qx - ra = 0 \\), by putting \\( y = \\sqrt{a}x \\), or \\( x = \\frac{y}{\\sqrt{a}} \\), is transformed into this equation, \\( y^3 - p\\sqrt{a}x^2 + qy - ra = 0 \\). Which, by multiplying all the terms by \\( \\sqrt{a} \\), becomes \\( y^3 - pay^2 + qay - ra = 0 \\), an equation free of surds. But in order to make this succeed, the surd \\( \\sqrt{a} \\) must enter the alternate terms, beginning with the second.\n\n\"An equation, as \\( x^3 - px^2 + qx - r = 0 \\), may be transformed into one whose roots shall be the quantities reciprocal of \\( x \\); by supposing \\( y = \\frac{1}{x} \\), and \\( y = \\frac{z}{r} \\), or (by one supposition), \\( x = \\frac{r}{z} \\), becomes \\( z^3 - qz^2 + prz - r^2 = 0 \\).\n\nIn the equation of \\( y \\), it is manifest, that the order of the coefficients is inverted; so that, if the second term had been wanting in the proposed equation, the last but one should have been wanting in the equations of \\( y \\) and \\( z \\). If the 3rd had been wanting in the equation proposed, the last but two had been wanting in the equations of \\( y \\) and \\( z \\).\n\nAnother use of this transformation is, that the greatest\nleft root in the one is transformed into the least root in the other. For since \\( x = \\frac{1}{y} \\), and \\( y = \\frac{1}{x} \\), it is plain, that when the value of \\( x \\) is greatest, the value of \\( y \\) is least, and conversely.\n\nHow an equation is transformed so as to have all its roots affirmative, shall be explained in the following chapter.\n\n**Chap. XVII. Of finding the Roots of Equations when two or more of the Roots are equal to each other.**\n\n\u00a71. Before we proceed to explain how to resolve equations of all sorts, we shall first demonstrate how an equation that has two or more roots equal, is depressed to a lower dimension; and its resolution made, consequently, more easy. And shall endeavour to explain the grounds of this and many other rules we shall give in the remaining part of this treatise, in a more simple and concise manner than has hitherto been done.\n\nIn order to this, we must look back to the last chapter, where we find, that if any equation, as \\( x^3 - px^2 + qx - r = 0 \\), is proposed, and you are to transform it into another that shall have its roots less than the values of \\( x \\) by any given difference, as \\( e \\), you are to assume \\( y = x - e \\), and substituting for \\( x \\) its value \\( y + e \\), you find the transformed equation,\n\n\\[\ny^3 + 3ey^2 + 3e^2y + e^3 - py^2 - 2pey - pe^2 + qy + qe - r = 0.\n\\]\n\nWhere we are to observe,\n\n1\u00b0. That the last term \\( (e^3 - pe^2 + qe - r) \\) is the very equation that was proposed, having \\( e \\) in place of \\( x \\).\n\n2\u00b0. The coefficient of the last term but one is \\( 3e^2 - 2pe + q \\), which is the quantity that arises by multiplying every term of the last coefficient \\( e^3 - pe^2 + qe - r \\) by the index of \\( e \\) in each term, and dividing the product \\( 3e^3 - 2pe^2 + qe \\) by the quantity \\( e \\) that is common to all the terms.\n\n3\u00b0. The coefficient of the last term but two is \\( 3e - p \\), which is the quantity that arises by multiplying every term of the coefficient last found \\( (3e^2 - 2pe + q) \\) by the index of \\( e \\) in each term, and dividing the whole by \\( 2e \\).\n\n\u00a72. These same observations extend to equations of all dimensions. If it is the biquadratic \\( x^4 - px^3 + qx^2 - rx + s = 0 \\) that is proposed, then by supposing \\( y = x - e \\), it will be transformed into this other,\n\n\\[\ny^4 + 4ey^3 + 6e^2y^2 + 4e^3y + e^4 - py^3 - 3pey^2 - 3pe^2y - pe^3 + gy^2 + 2qey + qe^2 - ry - re + s = 0.\n\\]\n\nWhere again it is obvious, That the last term is the equation that was proposed, having \\( e \\) in place of \\( x \\): That the last term but one has for its coefficient the quantity that arises by multiplying the terms of the last quantity by the indices of \\( e \\) in each term; and dividing the product by \\( e \\). That the coefficient of the last term but two, (viz. \\( 6e^2 - 3pe^2 + q \\)) is deduced in the same manner from the term immediately following, that is, by multiplying every term of \\( 4e^3 - 3pe^2 + 2qe - r \\) by the index of \\( e \\) in that term, and dividing the whole by \\( e \\) multiplied into the index of \\( y \\) in the term sought, that is, by \\( e \\times 2 \\): And the next term is \\( 4e - p = \\frac{6e^2 \\times 2 - 3pe \\times 1}{3e} \\).\n\nThe demonstration of this may easily be made general by the theorem for finding the powers of a binomial, since the transformed equation consists of the powers of the binomial \\( y + e \\) that are marked by the indices of \\( e \\) in the last term, multiplied each by their coefficients \\( 1, -p, +q, -r, +s, \\) &c. respectively.\n\n\u00a73. From the last two articles we can easily find the terms of the transformed equation without any involution. The last term is had by substituting \\( e \\) instead of \\( x \\) in the proposed equation; the next term, by multiplying every part of that last term by the index of \\( e \\) in each part, and dividing the whole by \\( e \\); and the following terms in the manner described in the foregoing article; the respective divisors being the quantity \\( e \\) multiplied by the index of \\( y \\) in each term.\n\nThe demonstration for finding when two or more roots are equal will be easy, if we add to this, that \"when the unknown quantity enters all the terms of any equation, then one of its values is equal to nothing.\" As in the equation \\( x^3 - px^2 + qx = 0 \\), where \\( x = 0 \\) being one of the simple equations that produce \\( x^3 - px^2 + qx = 0 \\), it follows that one of the values of \\( x \\) is 0. In like manner, two of the values of \\( x \\) are equal to nothing in this equation \\( x^3 - px^2 = 0 \\); and three of them vanish in the equation \\( x^4 - px^3 = 0 \\).\n\nIt is also obvious (conversely) that \"if \\( x \\) does not enter all the terms of the equation, i.e. if the last term be not wanting, then none of the values of \\( x \\) can be equal to nothing,\" for if every term be not multiplied by \\( x \\), then \\( x = 0 \\) cannot be a divisor of the whole equation, and consequently 0 cannot be one of the values of \\( x \\). If \\( x^2 \\) does not enter into all the terms of the equation, then two of the values of \\( x \\) cannot be equal to nothing. If \\( x^3 \\) does not enter into all the terms of the equation, then three of the values of \\( x \\) cannot be equal to nothing, &c.\n\n\u00a74. Suppose now that two values of \\( x \\) are equal to one another, and to \\( e \\); then it is plain that two values of \\( y \\) in the transformed equation will be equal to nothing: since \\( y = x - e \\). And consequently, by the last article, the two last terms of the transformed equation must vanish.\n\nSuppose it is the cubic equation of \u00a71, that is proposed, viz. \\( x^3 - px^2 + qx - r = 0 \\); and because we suppose \\( x = e \\), therefore the last term of the transformed equation, viz. \\( e^3 - pe^2 + qe - r \\) will vanish. And since two values of \\( y \\) vanish, the last term but one, viz. \\( 3e^2 - 2pe + q \\) will vanish at the same time. So that \\( 3e^2 - 2pe + q = 0 \\). But, by supposition, \\( e = x \\); therefore, when two values of \\( x \\), in the equation, \\( x^3 - px^2 + qx - r = 0 \\), are equal, it follows, that \\( 3x^2 - 2px + q = 0 \\). And thus,\nthus, \"the proposed cubic is depressed to a quadratic\nthat has one of its roots equal to one of the roots of\nthat cubic.\"\n\nIf it is the biquadratic that is proposed, viz., \\( x^4 - px^3 + qx^2 - rx + s = 0 \\), and two of its roots be equal; then supposing \\( e = x \\), two of the values of \\( y \\) must vanish, and the equation of \u00a7 2. will be reduced to this form.\n\n\\[\ny^4 + 4ey^3 + 6e^2y^2 - py^3 - 3pe^2y + qe^3 = 0.\n\\]\n\nSo that\n\n\\[\n4e^3 - 3pe^2 + 2qe - r = 0; \\quad \\text{or, because } x = e,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4x^3 - 3px^2 + 2qx - r = 0.\n\\]\n\nIn general, when two values of \\( x \\) are equal to each other, and to \\( e \\), the two last terms of the transformed equation vanish; and consequently, \"if you multiply the terms of the proposed equation by the indices of \\( x \\) in each term, the quantity that will arise will be \\( = 0 \\), and will give an equation of a lower dimension than the proposed, that shall have one of its roots equal to one of the roots of the proposed equation.\"\n\nThat the last two terms of the equation vanish when the values of \\( x \\) are supposed equal to each other, and to \\( e \\), will also appear by considering, that since two values of \\( y \\) then become equal to nothing, the product of the values of \\( y \\) must vanish, which is equal to the last term of the equation; and because two of the four values of \\( y \\) are equal to nothing, it follows also that one of any three that can be taken out of these four must be \\( = 0 \\); and therefore, the products made by multiplying any three must vanish; and consequently the coefficient of the last term but one, which is equal to the sum of these products, must vanish.\n\n\u00a7 5. After the same manner, if there are three equal roots in the biquadratic \\( x^4 - px^3 + qx^2 - rx + s = 0 \\), and if \\( e \\) be equal to one of them, three values of \\( y \\) (\\( x = e \\)) will vanish, and consequently \\( y^3 \\) will enter all the terms of the transformed equation; which will have this form,\n\n\\[\ny^4 + 4ey^3 + 6e^2y^2 - py^3 - 3pe^2y + qe^3 = 0.\n\\]\n\nSo that here\n\n\\[\n6e^2 - 3pe + qe = 0; \\quad \\text{or, since } e = x, \\text{ therefore},\n\\]\n\n\\[\n6x^2 - 3px + q = 0; \\quad \\text{and one of the roots of this quadratic will be equal to one of the roots of the proposed biquadratic.}\n\\]\n\nIn this case, two of the roots of the cubic equation \\( 4x^3 - 3px^2 + 2qx - r = 0 \\) are roots of the proposed biquadratic, because the quantity \\( 6x^2 - 3px + q \\) is deduced from \\( 4x^3 - 3px^2 + 2qx - r \\), by multiplying the terms by the indexes of \\( x \\) in each term.\n\nIn general, \"whatever is the number of equal roots in the proposed equation, they will all remain but one in the equation that is deduced from it, by multiplying all the terms by the indexes of \\( x \\) in them; and they will all remain but two in the equation deduced in the same manner from that;\" and so of the rest.\n\n\u00a7 6. What we observed of the coefficients of equations transformed by supposing \\( y = x - e \\), leads to this easy demonstration of this rule; and will be applied in the next chapter to demonstrate the rules for finding the limits of equations.\n\nIt is obvious, however, that though we make use of equations whose signs change alternately, the same reasoning extends to all other equations.\n\nIt is a consequence also of what has been demonstrated, that, \"if two roots of any equation, as \\( x^3 - px^2 + qx - r = 0 \\), are equal, then multiplying the terms by any arithmetical series, as, \\( a + 3b, a + 2b, a + b, a \\), the product will be \\( = 0 \\).\"\n\nFor, since\n\n\\[\nax^3 - apx^2 + aqx - ar = 0; \\quad \\text{and}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n3x^2 - 2px + qx - r = 0, \\quad \\text{it follows that}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nax^3 + 3bx^2 - apx^2 + aqx + bxq - ar = 0.\n\\]\n\nWhich is the product that arises by multiplying the terms of the proposed equation by the terms of the series, \\( a + 3b, a + 2b, a + b, a \\); which may represent any arithmetical progression.\n\n**Chap.

Of the Limits of Equations.**\n\nWe now proceed to show how to discover the limits of the roots of equations, by which their solution is much facilitated.\n\nLet any equation, as \\( x^3 - px^2 + qx - r = 0 \\) be proposed; and transform it, as above, into the equation\n\n\\[\ny^3 + 3ey^2 + 3e^2y + e^3 - py^2 - 2pe^2y + pe^3 = 0.\n\\]\n\nWhere the values of \\( y \\) are less than the respective values of \\( x \\) by the difference \\( e \\). If you suppose \\( e \\) to be taken such as to make all the coefficients of the equation of \\( y \\) positive, viz., \\( e^3 - pe^2 + qe - r, 3e^2 - 2pe + q, 3e - p \\); then there being no variation of the signs in the equation, all the values of \\( y \\) must be negative; and consequently, the quantity \\( e \\), by which the values of \\( x \\) are diminished, must be greater than the greatest positive value of \\( x \\); and consequently must be the limit of the roots of the equation \\( x^3 - px^2 + qx - r = 0 \\).\n\nIt is sufficient therefore, in order to find the limit, to inquire what quantity substituted for \\( x \\) in each of these expressions \\( x^3 - px^2 + qx - r, 3x^2 - 2px + q, 3x - p \\), will give them all positive; for that quantity will be the limit required.\n\nHow these expressions are formed from one another, was explained in the beginning of the last chapter.\n\n**Examp.** If the equation \\( x^5 - 2x^4 - 10x^3 + 30x^2 + 63x + 120 = 0 \\) is proposed; and it is required to determine the limit that is greater than any of the roots; you are to inquire what integer number substituted for \\( x \\) in the proposed equation, and following equations deduced from it by \u00a7 3. chap. 17. will give, in each, a positive quantity,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n5x^4 - 8x^3 - 30x^2 + 60x + 63 \\\\\n5x^3 - 6x^2 - 15x + 15 \\\\\n5x^2 - 4x - 5 \\\\\n5x - 2.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThe least integer number which gives each of these positive, is 2; which therefore is the limit of the roots of\nof the proposed equation; or a number that exceeds the greatest positive root.\n\nIf the limit of the negative roots is required, you may (by chap. 16.) change the negative into positive roots; and then proceed as before to find their limits. Thus, in the example, you will find, that \u20143 is the limit of the negative roots. So that the five roots of the proposed equation are betwixt \u20143 and +2.\n\nHaving found the limit that surpasses the greatest positive root, call it m. And if you assume y = m \u2014 x, and for x substitute m \u2014 y, the equation that will arise will have all its roots positive; because m is supposed to surpass all the values of x, and consequently m \u2014 x (m \u2014 y) must always be affirmative. And, by this means, any equation may be changed into one that shall have all its roots affirmative.\n\nOr, if \u2014n represent the limit of the negative roots, then by assuming y = n + x, the proposed equation shall be transformed into one that shall have all its roots affirmative; for +n being greater than any negative value of x, it follows, that y = n + x must be always positive.\n\nThe greatest negative coefficient of any equation increased by unit, always exceeds the greatest root of the equation.\n\nTo demonstrate this, let the cubic \\(x^3 - px^2 - qx - r\\) be proposed; where all the terms are negative except the first. Assuming \\(y = x - e\\), it will be transformed into the following equation:\n\n\\[\n(A)\\quad y^3 + 3xy^2 + 3y^2 + e^2 \\\\\n- fy^2 - 2fy - f^2 \\\\\n-qy - qe \\\\\n-r\n\\]\n\n1\u00b0. Let us suppose that the coefficients p, q, r, are equal to each other; and if you also suppose \\(e = p + 1\\), then the last equation becomes\n\n\\[\n(B)\\quad y^3 + 2py^2 + p^2y + 1 \\\\\n+ 3y^2 + 3y \\\\\n+ 2y\n\\]\n\nwhere all the terms being positive, it follows that the values of y are all negative, and that consequently e, or \\(p + 1\\), is greater than the greatest value of x in the proposed equation.\n\n2\u00b0. If q and r be not \\(= p\\), but less than it, and for e you still substitute \\(p + 1\\) (since the negative part \\(-qy - qe - r\\) becomes less, the positive remaining undiminished,) a fortiori, all the coefficients of the equation (A) become positive. And the same is obvious if q and r have positive signs, and not negative signs, as we supposed. It appears therefore, \"that if, in any cubic equation, p be the greatest negative coefficient, then \\(p + 1\\) must surpass the greatest value of x.\"\n\n3\u00b0. By the same reasoning it appears, that if q be the greatest negative coefficient of the equation, and \\(e = q + 1\\), then there will be no variation of the signs in the equation of y; for it appears from the last article, that if all the three \\((p, q, r)\\) were equal to one another, and e equal to any one of them increased by unit, as to \\(q + 1\\), then all the terms of the equation (A) would be positive. Now if e be supposed still equal to \\(q + 1\\), and p and r to be less than q, then, a fortiori, all these terms will be positive, the negative part, which involves p and r being diminished, while the positive part and the negative involving q remain as before.\n\n4\u00b0. After the same manner it is demonstrated, that if r is the greatest negative coefficient in the equation, and e is supposed \\(= r + 1\\), then all the terms of the equation (A) of y will be positive; and consequently \\(r + 1\\) will be greater than any of the values of x.\n\nWhat we have said of the cubic equation \\(x^3 - px^2 - qx - r = 0\\), is easily applicable to others.\n\nIn general, we conclude, that \"the greatest negative coefficient in any equation increased by unit, is always a limit that exceeds all the roots of that equation.\"\n\nBut it is to be observed at the same time, that the greatest negative coefficient increased by unit, is very seldom the nearest limit: that is best discovered by the rule in the beginning of this chapter.\n\nHaving shewn how to change any proposed equation into one that shall have all its roots affirmative; we shall only treat of such as have all their roots positive, in what remains relating to the limits of equations.\n\nAny such equation may be represented by \\(x - a \\times x - b \\times x - c \\times x - d, &c., = 0\\), whose roots are a, b, c, d, &c.\n\nAnd of all such equations two limits are easily discovered from what precedes, viz. \\(a\\), which is less than the least, and \\(e\\), found as directed in the beginning of this chapter, which surpasses the greatest root of the equation.\n\nBut, besides these, we shall now shew how to find other limits betwixt the roots themselves. And, for this purpose, will suppose a to be the least root, b the second root, c the third, and so on; it being arbitrary.\n\nIf you substitute o in place of the unknown quantity, putting \\(x = o\\), the quantity that will arise from that supposition is the last term of the equation, all the others that involve x vanishing.\n\nIf you substitute for x a quantity less than the least root a, the quantity resulting will have the same sign as the last term; that is, will be positive or negative according as the equation is of an even or odd number of dimensions. For all the factors \\(x - a, x - b, x - c, &c.\\), will be negative, and their product will be positive or negative according as their number is even or odd.\n\nIf you substitute for x a quantity greater than the least root a, but less than all the other roots, then the sign of the quantity resulting will be contrary to what it was before; because one factor \\((x - a)\\) becomes now positive, all the others remaining negative as before.\n\nIf you substitute for x a quantity greater than the two least roots, but less than all the rest, both the factors \\(x - a, x - b\\), become positive, and the rest remain as they were. So that the whole product will have the same sign as the last term of the equation. Thus successively placing instead of x quantities that are limits betwixt the roots of the equation, the quantities that result will have alternately the signs + and \u2014. And, conversely, \"if you find quantities which, substituted in place of x in the proposed equation, do give alternately positive and negative results, those quantities are the limits of that equation.\"\nIt is useful to observe, that, in general, \"when, by substituting any two numbers for \\( x \\) in any equation, the results have contrary signs, one or more of the roots of the equation must be betwixt those numbers.\" Thus, in the equation, \\( x^3 - 2x^2 - 5 = 0 \\), if you substitute 2 and 3 for \\( x \\), the results are -5, +4; whence it follows, that the roots are betwixt 2 and 3: for when these results have different signs, one or other of the factors which produce the equations must have changed its sign; suppose it is \\( x = e \\), then it is plain that \\( e \\) must be betwixt the numbers supposed equal to \\( x \\).\n\nLet the cubic equation \\( x^3 - px^2 + qx - r = 0 \\) be proposed, and let it be transformed, by assuming \\( y = x - e \\), into the equation\n\n\\[\ny^3 + 3ey^2 + 3e^2y + e^3 - py^2 - 2pey - pe^2 + qy + qe - r = 0.\n\\]\n\nLet us suppose \\( e \\) equal successively to the three values of \\( x \\), beginning with the least value; and because the last term \\( e^3 - pe^2 + qe - r \\) will vanish in all these suppositions, the equation will have this form,\n\n\\[\ny^3 + 3ey^2 + 3e^2y + e^3 - py^2 - 2pey - pe^2 + qy + qe - r = 0;\n\\]\n\nwhere the last term \\( 3e^2 - 2pe + q \\) is, from the nature of equations, produced of the remaining values of \\( y \\); or of the excesses of two other values of \\( x \\) above what is supposed equal to \\( e \\); since always \\( y = x - e \\). Now,\n\n1\u00b0. If \\( e \\) be equal to the least value of \\( x \\), then those two excesses being both positive, they will give a positive product, and consequently \\( 3e^2 - 2pe + q \\) will be, in this case, positive.\n\n2\u00b0. If \\( e \\) be equal to the second value of \\( x \\), then, of those two excesses, one being negative and one positive, their product \\( 3e^2 - 2pe + q \\) will be negative.\n\n3\u00b0. If \\( e \\) be equal to the third and greatest value of \\( x \\), then the two excesses being both negative, their product \\( 3e^2 - 2pe + q \\) is positive. Whence,\n\nIf in the equation \\( 3e^2 - 2pe + q = 0 \\), you substitute successively in the place of \\( e \\), the three roots of the equation \\( e^3 - pe^2 + qe - r = 0 \\), the quantities resulting will successively have the signs +, -, +; and consequently the three roots of the cubic equation are the limits of the roots of the equation \\( e^3 - pe^2 + qe - r = 0 \\). That is, the least of the roots of the cubic is less than the least of the roots of the other; the second root of the cubic is a limit between the two roots of the other; and the greatest root of the cubic is the limit that exceeds both the roots of the other.\n\nWe demonstrated, that the roots of the cubic equation \\( e^3 - pe^2 + qe - r = 0 \\) are limits of the quadratic \\( 3e^2 - 2pe + q \\); hence it follows (conversely) that the roots of the quadratic \\( 3e^2 - 2pe + q = 0 \\) are the limits between the first and second, and between the second and third roots of the cubic \\( e^3 - pe^2 + qe - r = 0 \\). So that if you find the limit that exceeds the greatest root of the cubic, by the beginning of this chapter you will have (with \\( o \\), which is the limit less than any of the roots) four limits for the three roots of the proposed cubic.\n\nIt was demonstrated in chap 17. \u00a73, how the quadratic \\( 3e^2 - 2pe + q \\) is deduced from the proposed cubic \\( e^3 - pe^2 + qe - r = 0 \\), viz., by multiplying each term by the index of \\( e \\) in it, and then dividing the whole by \\( e \\); and what we have demonstrated of cubic equations is easily extended to all others; so that we conclude \"that the last term but one of the transformed equation is the equation for determining the limits of the proposed equation.\" Or, that the equation arising by multiplying each term by the index of the unknown quantity in it, is the equation whose roots give the limits of the proposed equation; if you add to them the two mentioned in p. 109, col. 2, par. 4.\n\nFor the same reason, it is plain that the root of the simple equation \\( 3e^2 - 2pe + q = 0 \\), (i.e., \\( \\frac{p}{q} \\)) is the limit between the two roots of the quadratic \\( 3e^2 - 2pe + q = 0 \\). And, as \\( 4e^3 - 3pe^2 + 2qe - r = 0 \\) gives three limits of the equation \\( e^3 - pe^2 + qe - r = 0 \\), so the quadratic \\( 6e^2 - 3pe + q = 0 \\) gives two limits that are betwixt the roots of the cubic \\( 4e^3 - 3pe^2 + 2qe - r = 0 \\); and \\( 4e^3 - 2pe + q = 0 \\) gives one limit that is betwixt the two roots of the quadratic \\( 6e^2 - 3pe + q = 0 \\). So that we have a complete series of these equations arising from a simple equation to the proposed, each of which determines the limits of the following equation.\n\nIf two roots in the proposed equation are equal, then \"the limit that ought to be betwixt them must, in this case, become equal to one of the equal roots themselves.\" Which perfectly agrees with what was demonstrated in the last chapter, concerning the rule for finding the equal roots of equations.\n\nAnd, the same equation that gives the limits, giving also one of the equal roots, when two or more are equal, it appears, that \"if you substitute a limit in place of the unknown quantity in an equation,\" and instead of a positive or negative result, it be found = 0, then you may conclude, that \"not only the limit itself is a root of the equation, but that there are two roots in that equation equal to it and to one another.\"\n\nIt having been demonstrated, that the roots of the equation \\( x^3 - px^2 + qx - r = 0 \\) are the limits of the roots of the equation \\( 3x^2 - 2px + q = 0 \\), the three roots of the cubic equation, which suppose to be \\( a, b, c \\), substituted for \\( x \\) in the quadratic \\( 3x^2 - 2px + q = 0 \\), must give the results positive and negative alternately. Suppose these three results to be \\( +N, -M, +L \\); that is, \\( 3a^2 - 2pa + q = N \\), \\( 3b^2 - 2pb + q = -M \\), \\( 3c^2 - 2pc + q = L \\); and since \\( a^3 - pa^2 + qa - r = 0 \\), and \\( 3a^2 - 2pa + q = N \\times a \\), subtracting the former multiplied into 3 from the latter, the remainder is \\( pa^2 - 2ga + 3r = N \\times a \\). In the same manner \\( pb^2 - 2gb + 3r = -M \\times b \\), and \\( pc^2 - 2gc + 3r = L \\times c \\). Therefore \\( px^2 - 2gx + 3r \\) is such a quantity, that if, for \\( x \\), you substitute in it successively \\( a, b, c \\), the results will be \\( +N \\times a, -M \\times b, +L \\times c \\). Whence \\( a, b, c \\) are limits of the equation \\( px^2 - 2gx + 3r = 0 \\), by p. 109, col. 2, par. 8. and, conversely, the roots of the equation \\( px^2 - 2gx + 3r = 0 \\) are limits between the first and second, and between the second and third roots of the cubic \\( x^3 - px^2 + qx - r = 0 \\). Now the equation \\( px^2 - 2gx + 3r = 0 \\) arises\nrises from the proposed cubic by multiplying the terms of this latter by the arithmetical progression \\(0, -1, -2, -3\\). And, in the same manner, it may be shewn that the roots of the equation \\(px^3 + 2qx^2 + 3rx + 4 = 0\\) are limits of the equation \\(x^4 - px^3 + qx^2 - rx + s = 0\\).\n\nOr, multiply the terms of the equation\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n& x^3 - px^2 + qx - r = 0 \\\\\n\\text{by} & \\quad a + 3b, \\quad a + 2b, \\quad a + b, \\quad a\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n& ax^3 - apx^2 + aqx - ar = 0 \\\\\n& + 3bx^3 - 2bpq + bqx = (3x^3 - 2px + qx)\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAny arithmetical series where \\(a\\) is the least term, and \\(b\\) the common difference, and the products (if you substitute for \\(x\\), successively, \\(a, b, c\\), the three roots of the proposed cubic) shall be \\(+N \\times bx, -M \\times bx + L \\times bx\\). For the first part of the product \\(ax^3 - px^2 + qx - r = 0\\); and \\(a, b, c\\), being limits in the equation \\(3x^3 - 2px + qx = 0\\), their substitution must give results \\(N, M, L\\), alternately positive and negative.\n\nIn general, the roots of the equation \\(x^n - px^{n-1} + qx^{n-2} - rx^{n-3} + \\ldots = 0\\) are limits of the roots of the equation \\(x^n - px^{n-1} + qx^{n-2} - rx^{n-3} + \\ldots = 0\\); or of any equation that is deduced from it by multiplying its terms by any arithmetical progression, \\(a, b, c, \\ldots\\). And, conversely, the roots of this new equation will be limits of the proposed equation\n\n\\[\nx^n - px^{n-1} + qx^{n-2} - rx^{n-3} + \\ldots = 0.\n\\]\n\n\"If any roots of the equation of the limits are impossible, then must there be some roots of the proposed equation impossible.\" For as (in p. 110, col. 1, par. 2,) the quantity \\(3x^2 - 2px + q\\) was demonstrated to be equal to the product of the excesses of two values of \\(x\\) above the third supposed equal to \\(e\\); if any impossible expression be found in those excesses, then there will of consequence be found impossible expressions in those two values of \\(x\\).\n\nAnd \"from this observation rules may be deduced for discovering when there are impossible roots in equations.\" Of which we shall treat afterwards.\n\nBesides the method already explained, there are others by which limits may be determined which the root of an equation cannot exceed.\n\nSince the squares of all real quantities are affirmative, it follows, that \"the sum of the squares of the roots of any equation must be greater than the square of the greatest root.\" And the square root of that sum will therefore be a limit that must exceed the greatest root of the equation.\n\nIf the equation proposed is \\(x^n - px^{n-1} + qx^{n-2} - rx^{n-3} + \\ldots = 0\\), then the sum of the squares of the roots (p. 103, col. 1, par. 1.) will be \\(p^2 - 2q\\). So that \\(\\sqrt{p^2 - 2q}\\) will exceed the greatest root of that equation.\n\nOr if you find, by p. 103, col. 1, par. 4., the sum of the 4th powers of the roots of the equation, and extract the biquadratic root of that sum, it will also exceed the greatest root of the equation.\n\nIf you find a mean proportional between the sum of the squares of any two roots, \\(a, b\\), and the sum of their biquadrates \\((a^4 + b^4)\\), this mean proportional will be \\(\\sqrt[4]{a^6 + a^4b^2 + a^2b^4 + b^6}\\). And the sum of the cubes is \\(a^3 + b^3\\). Now, since \\(a^2 - 2ab + b^2\\) is the square of \\(a - b\\), it must be always positive; and if you multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), the product \\(a^4b^2 - 2a^2b^4 + a^2b^4\\) will also be positive; and consequently \\(a^4b^2 - a^2b^4\\) will be always greater than \\(2a^2b^2\\). Add \\(a^6 + b^6\\) and we have \\(a^6 + a^4b^2 + a^2b^4 + b^6\\) greater than \\(a^6 + 2a^4b^2 + b^6\\); and extracting the root \\(\\sqrt[4]{a^6 + a^4b^2 + a^2b^4 + b^6}\\) greater than \\(a^3 + b^3\\). And the same may be demonstrated of any number of roots whatever.\n\nNow, if you add the sum of all the cubes taken affirmatively to their sum with their proper signs, they will give double the sum of the cubes of the affirmative roots. And if you subtract the second sum from the first, there will remain double the sum of the cubes of the negative roots. Whence it follows, that \"half the sum of the mean proportional betwixt the sum of the squares and the sum of the biquadrates, and of the sum of the cubes of the roots with their proper signs, exceeds the sum of the cubes of the affirmative roots:\" and \"half their difference exceeds the sum of the cubes of the negative roots.\" And, by extracting the cube root of that sum and difference, you will obtain limits that shall exceed the sums of the affirmative and of the negative roots. And since it is easy, from what has been already explained, to diminish the roots of an equation so that they all may become negative but one, it appears how, by this means, you may approximate very near to that root. But this does not serve when there are impossible roots.\n\nSeveral other rules like these might be given for limiting the roots of equations. We shall give one not mentioned by other authors.\n\nIn a cubic \\(x^3 - px^2 + qx - r = 0\\), find \\(q^2 - 2pr\\), and call it \\(e^4\\); then shall the greatest root of the equation always be greater than \\(\\frac{e^4}{4}\\), or \\(\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{e^4}{3}}\\). And,\n\nIn any equation \\(x^n - px^{n-1} + qx^{n-2} - rx^{n-3} + \\ldots = 0\\), find \\(q^2 - 2pr + 2\\), and extracting the root of the 4th power out of that quantity, it shall always be less than the greatest root of the equation.\n\n**Chap. XIX. Of the Resolution of Equations, all whose Root are commensurate.**\n\nIt was demonstrated in chap. 15, that the last term of any equation is the product of its roots: from which it follows, that the roots of an equation, when commensurable quantities, will be found among the divisors of the last term. And hence we have, for the resolution of equations, this\n\n**Rule.** Bring all the terms to one side of the equation, find all the divisors of the last term, and substitute them successively for the unknown quantity in the equation. So shall that divisor which, substituted in this manner,\nmanner; gives the result =0, be the root of the pro-\nposed equation.\n\nFor example, suppose this equation is to be resolved,\n\n\\[ x^3 - 3ax^2 + 2a^2x - 2a^3b \\]\n\nwhere the last term is \\( 2a^3b \\), whose simple literal divisors are \\( a, b, 2a, 2b \\), each of which may be taken either positively or negatively; but as here we find there are variations of signs in the equation, we need only take them positively. Suppose \\( x = a \\) the first of the divisors, and substituting \\( a \\) for \\( x \\), the equation becomes\n\n\\[ a^3 - 3a^2 + 2a^2 - 2a^3b \\]\n\nSo that, the whole vanishing, it follows, that \\( a \\) is one of the roots of the equation.\n\nAfter the same manner, if you substitute \\( b \\) in place of \\( x \\), the equation is\n\n\\[ b^3 - 3ab^2 + 2a^2b - 2a^3b \\]\n\nwhich vanishing, shews \\( b \\) to be another root of the equa-\ntion.\n\nAgain, if you substitute \\( 2a \\) for \\( x \\), you will find all the terms destroy one another so as to make the sum =0.\n\nFor it will then be\n\n\\[ 8a^3 - 12a^2 + 4a^2 - 2a^3b \\]\n\nWhence we find, that \\( 2a \\) is the third root of the equa-\ntion. Which, after the first two (\\( +a, +b \\)) had been found, might have been collected from this, that the last term being the product of the three roots, \\( +a, +b \\), being known, the third must necessarily be equal to the last term divided by the product \\( ab \\), that is, \\( \\frac{2a^3b}{ab} = 2a \\).\n\nLet the roots of the cubic equation\n\n\\[ x^3 - 2x^2 - 33x + 90 = 0 \\]\n\nAnd first the divisors of 90 are found to be 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, 90. If you substitute 1 for \\( x \\), you will find \\( x^3 - 2x^2 - 33x + 90 = 56 \\); so that 1 is not a root of the equation. If you substitute 2 for \\( x \\), the result will be 24; but, putting \\( x = 3 \\), you have\n\n\\[ x^3 - 2x^2 - 33x + 90 = 27 - 18 - 99 + 90 = 117 - 117 = 0. \\]\n\nSo that three is one of the roots of the proposed equa-\ntion. The other affirmative root is \\( +5 \\); and after you find it, as it is manifest from the equation, that the other root is negative, you are not to try any more divisors ta-\nken positively, but to substitute them, negatively taken, for \\( x \\); and thus you find, that \\( -6 \\) is the third root.\n\nFor putting \\( x = -6 \\), you have\n\n\\[ x^3 - 2x^2 - 33x + 90 = -216 - 72 + 198 + 90 = 0. \\]\n\nThis last root might have been found by dividing the last term 90, having its sign changed by 15, the product of the two roots already found.\n\nWhen one of the roots of an equation is found, in order to find the rest with less trouble, divide the propo-\nsed equation by the simple equation which you are to de-\n\nduce from the root already found, and the quotient shall give an equation of a degree lower than the proposed; whose roots will give the remaining roots required.\n\nAs for example, the root \\( +3 \\), first found, gave \\( x = 3 \\), or \\( x - 3 = 0 \\), whence dividing thus,\n\n\\[ x - 3 \\mid x^3 - 2x^2 - 33x + 90 \\]\n\nThe quotient shall give a quadratic equation \\( x^2 + x - 30 = 0 \\), which must be the product of the other two simple equations from which the cubic is generated, and whose roots therefore must be two of the roots of that cubic.\n\nNow the roots of that quadratic equation are easily found, by chap. 12, to be \\( +5 \\) and \\( -6 \\). For,\n\n\\[ x^2 + x - 30 \\]\n\nadd \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot x^2 + x + \\frac{1}{4} = 30 + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{121}{4} \\]\n\nand \\( x = \\frac{-1}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{121}{4}} = \\pm 5 \\)\n\nAfter the same manner, if the biquadratic \\( x^4 - 2x^3 - 25x^2 + 26x + 120 = 0 \\) is to be resolved; by substituting the divisors of 120 for \\( x \\), you will find, that \\( +3 \\), one of those divisors, is one of the roots; the substitution of 3 for \\( x \\) giving \\( 81 - 54 - 225 + 78 + 120 = 279 - 279 = 0 \\).\n\nAnd therefore, dividing the proposed equation by \\( x - 3 \\), you must inquire for the roots of the cubic \\( x^3 + x^2 - 22x - 40 = 0 \\), and finding that \\( +5 \\), one of the divisors of 40, is one of the roots, you divide that cubic by \\( x - 5 \\), and the quotient gives the quadratic \\( x^2 + 6x + 8 = 0 \\), whose two roots are \\( -2, -4 \\). So that the four roots of the biquadratic are \\( +3, +5, -2, -4 \\).\n\nThis rule supposes that you can find all the divisors of the last term; which you may always do thus.\n\n\"If it is a simple quantity, divide it by its least divi-\nfor that exceeds unit, and the quotient again by its\nleast divisor, proceeding thus till you have a quotient\nthat is not divisible by any number greater than unit.\nThis quotient, with these divisors, are the first or\nsimple divisors of the quantity. And the products of\nthe multiplication of any 2, 3, 4, &c. of them are\nthe compound divisors.\"\n\nAs to find the divisors of 60; first I divide by 2,\nand the quotient 30 again by 2, then the next quo-\n15 by 3, and the quotient of this division 5 is not farther\ndivisible by any integer above units; so that the simple\ndivisors are,\n\n\\[ 2, 2, 3, 5; \\]\nThe products of two, 4, 6, 10, 15.\nThe products of three, 12, 20, 30.\nThe product of all four, . . . . . . . . . . 60.\nThe divisors of 90 are found after the same manner; Simple\nSimple divisors, 2, 3, 5.\n\nThe products of two, 6, 9, 10, 15.\n\nThe products of three, 18, 30, 45.\n\nThe product of all four, 90.\n\nThe divisors of 21ab.\n\nThe simple divisors, 3, 7, a, b, b.\n\nThe products of two, 21, 3a, 3b, 7a, 7b, ab, bb.\n\nThe products of three, 21a, 21b, 3ab, 3bb, 7ab, 7bb, abb.\n\nThe products of four, 21ab, 21bb, 3abb, 7abb.\n\nThe products of the five, 21abb.\n\nBut as the last term may have very many divisors, and the labour may be very great to substitute them all for the unknown quantity, we shall now show how it may be abridged, by limiting to a small number the divisors you are to try. And, first, it is plain, from p. 109, col. 1, par. 4, that \"any divisor that exceeds the greatest negative coefficient by unity is to be neglected.\" Thus, in resolving the equation \\( x^3 - 2x^2 - 25x + 120 = 0 \\), as 25 is the greatest negative coefficient, we conclude, that the divisors of 120 that exceed 25 may be neglected.\n\nBut the labour may be still abridged, if we make use of the rule in the beginning of ch. 18.; that is, if we find the number which substituted in these following expressions,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx^4 - 2x^3 - 25x^2 + 26x + 120, \\\\\n2x^3 - 3x^2 - 25x + 13, \\\\\n6x^2 - 6x - 25, \\\\\n2x - 1,\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nwill give in them all a positive result: for that number will be greater than the greatest root, and all the divisors of 120 that exceed it may be neglected.\n\nThat this investigation may be easier, we ought to begin always with that expression where the negative roots seem to prevail most; as here in the quadratic expression \\( 6x^2 - 6x - 25 \\); where finding that 6 substituted for \\( x \\) gives that expression positive, and gives all the other expressions at the same time positive, I conclude, that 6 is greater than any of the roots, and that all the divisors of 120 that exceed 6 may be neglected.\n\nIf the equation \\( x^3 + 11x^2 + 10x - 72 = 0 \\) is proposed, the rule of p. 109, col. 1, par. 4., does not help to abridge the operation; the last term itself being the greatest negative term. But, by chap. 18. we inquire what number substituted for \\( x \\) will give all these expressions positive.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx^3 + 11x^2 + 10x - 72 \\\\\n3x^2 + 22x + 10 \\\\\n3x + 11.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nWhere the suppositions of \\( x = 1, x = 0, x = -1 \\), give the quantity \\( x^3 - x^2 - 10x + 6 \\) equal to \\(-4, 6, 14\\); among whose divisors we find only one arithmetical progression\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c}\n\\text{Suppos.} & \\text{Result.} & \\text{Divisors, Arith.Prog.} \\\\\n\\hline\nx = 1 & x^3 - x^2 - 10x + 6 = -4 & 1, 2, 4 \\\\\nx = 0 & x^3 - x^2 - 10x + 6 = 6 & 1, 2, 3, 6 \\\\\nx = -1 & x^3 - x^2 - 10x + 6 = 14 & 1, 2, 7, 14\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nWhere the labour is very short, since we need only attend to the first expression; and we see immediately that 4 substituted for \\( x \\) gives a positive result, whence all the divisors of 72 that exceed 4 are to be rejected; and thus by a few trials, we find, that +2 is the positive root of the equation. Then dividing the equation by \\( x - 2 \\), and resolving the quadratic equation that is the quotient of the division, you find the other two roots to be \\(-9, \\frac{-1}{9}\\).\n\nBut there is another method that reduces the divisors of the last term, that can be useful, till more narrow limits.\n\nSuppose the cubic equation \\( x^3 - px^2 + qx - r = 0 \\) is proposed to be resolved. Transform it to an equation whose roots shall be less than the values of \\( x \\) by unity, assuming \\( y = x - 1 \\). And the last term of the transformed equation will be \\( 1 - p + q - r \\); which is found by substituting unit, the difference of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), for \\( x \\), in the proposed equation; as will easily appear from p. 106, col. 1, par. 4., where, when \\( y = x - 1 \\), the last term of the transformed equation was \\( c^3 - pc^2 + qc - r \\).\n\nTransform again the equation \\( x^3 - px^2 + qx - r = 0 \\), by assuming \\( y = x + 1 \\), into an equation whose roots shall exceed the values of \\( x \\) by unit, and the last term of the transformed equation will be \\( 1 - p - q - r \\), the same that arises by substituting \\( -1 \\), the difference between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), for \\( x \\), in the proposed equation.\n\nNow the values of \\( x \\) are some of the divisors of \\( r \\), which is the last term when you suppose \\( x = 0 \\); and the values of the \\( y \\)'s are some of the divisors of \\( 1 - p + q - r \\), and of \\( 1 - p - q - r \\), respectively. And these values are in arithmetical progression increasing by the common difference unit; because \\( x = 1, x = -1 \\), are in that progression. And it is obvious the same reasoning may be extended to any equation of whatever degree. So that this gives a general method for the resolution of equations whose roots are commensurable.\n\n**Rule.** Substitute, in place of the unknown quantity, successively the terms of the progression, 1, 0, -1, &c., and find all the divisors of the sums that result; then take out all the arithmetical progressions you can find among these divisors, whose common difference is unit; and the values of \\( x \\) will be among the divisors arising from the substitutions of \\( x = 0 \\) that belong to these progressions. The values of \\( x \\) will be affirmative when the arithmetical progression increases, but negative when it decreases.\n\n**Examp.** Let it be required to find one of the roots of the equation \\( x^3 - x^2 - 10x + 6 = 0 \\). The operation is thus;\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c}\n\\text{Suppos.} & \\text{Result.} & \\text{Divisors, Arith.Prog.} \\\\\n\\hline\nx = 1 & x^3 - x^2 - 10x + 6 = -4 & 1, 2, 4 \\\\\nx = 0 & x^3 - x^2 - 10x + 6 = 6 & 1, 2, 3, 6 \\\\\nx = -1 & x^3 - x^2 - 10x + 6 = 14 & 1, 2, 7, 14\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n4, 3, 2; the term of which, opposite to the supposition of \\( x = 0 \\), being 3, and the series decreasing, we try if \\(-3\\) substituted for \\( x \\) makes the equation vanish; which succeeding\nsucceeding one of its roots must be $-3$. Then dividing the equation by $x+3$, we find the roots of the (quadratic) quotient $x^2 - 4x + 2 = 0$ are $2 \\pm \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nIf it is required to find the roots of the equation $x^3 - 3x^2 - 46x - 72 = 0$, the operation will be thus:\n\n| Supp. | Results | Divisors | Progreesions |\n|-------|----------|----------|-------------|\n| $x = 1$ | $120, 123, 145, 168, 190, 121, 152, 243, 304, 406, 601, 20$ | $3, 3, 4, 5$ |\n| $x = 0$ | $72, 123, 145, 168, 190, 121, 152, 243, 304, 406, 601, 20$ | $9, 2, 3, 4$ |\n| $x = -1$ | $30, 123, 145, 168, 190, 121, 152, 243, 304, 406, 601, 20$ | $10, 1, 2, 3$ |\n\nOf these four arithmetical progressions having their common difference equal to unit, the first gives $x = 9$, the others give $x = -2$, $x = -3$, $x = -4$; all which succeed except $x = -3$: so that the three values of $x$ are $+9$, $-2$, $-4$.\n\n**Chap. XX. Of the Resolution of Equations by finding the Equations of a lower Degree that are their Divisors.**\n\nTo find the roots of an equation is the same thing as to find the simple equations, by the multiplication of which into one another it is produced, or, to find the simple equations that divide it without a remainder.\n\nIf such simple equations cannot be found, yet if we can find the quadratic equations from which the proposed equation is produced, we may discover its roots afterwards by the resolution of these quadratic equations. Or, if neither these simple equations, nor these quadratic equations can be found, yet, by finding a cubic or biquadratic that is a divisor of the proposed equation, we may depress it lower, and make the solution more easy.\n\nNow, in order to find the rules by which these divisors may be discovered, we shall suppose, that\n\n$$mx^n + nx^{n-1} + rx + s$$\n\nare the quadratic cubic divisors of the proposed equation; and if $E$ represent the quotient arising by dividing the proposed equation by that divisor, then\n\n$$E = \\frac{mx^n + nx^{n-1} + rx + s}{mx^n + nx^{n-1} + rx + s}$$\n\nOr, $E \\times mx^n + nx^{n-1} + rx + s$, will represent the proposed equation itself. Where it is plain, that \"since $m$ is the coefficient of the highest term of the divisors, it must be a divisor of the coefficient of the highest term of the proposed equation.\"\n\nNext we are to observe, that, supposing the equation has a simple divisor $mx - n$, if we substitute in the equation $E \\times mx - n$, in place of $x$, any quantity, as $a$, then the quantity that will result from this substitution will necessarily have $ma - n$ for one of its divisors: since, in this substitution, $mx - n$ becomes $ma - n$.\n\nIf we substitute successively for $x$, any arithmetical progression, $a, a - e, a - 2e, \\ldots$, the quantities that will result from these substitutions will have among their divisors $ma - n$, $ma - me - n$, $ma - 2me - n$, which are also in arithmetical progression, having their common difference equal to $me$.\n\nIf, for example, we substitute for $x$ the terms of this progression, $1, 0, -1$, the quantities that result have among their divisors the arithmetical progression $m - n$, $-m - n$; or, changing the signs, $n - m$, $n + m$. Where the difference of the terms is $m$, and the term belonging to the supposition of $x = 0$ is $n$.\n\nIt is manifest therefore, that when an equation has any simple divisor, if you substitute for $x$ the progression $1, 0, -1$, there will be found amongst the divisors of the sums that result from these substitutions, one arithmetical progression at least; whose common difference will be unit or a divisor $m$ of the coefficient of the highest term, and which will be the coefficient of $x$ in the simple divisor required: and whose term, arising from the supposition of $x = 0$, will be $n$, the other member of the simple divisor $mx - n$.\n\nFrom which this rule is deduced for discovering such a simple divisor, when there is any.\n\n**Rule.** Substitute for $x$ in the proposed equation successively the numbers $1, 0, -1$. Find all the divisors of the sums that result from this substitution, and take out all the arithmetical progressions you can find amongst them, whose difference is unit, or some divisor of the coefficient of the highest term of the equation. Then suppose $n$ equal to that term of any one progression that arises from the supposition of $x = 0$, and $m$ the foreaid divisor of the coefficient of the highest term of the equation, which $m$ is also the difference of the terms of this progression; so shall you have $mx - n$ for the divisor required.\n\nYou may find arithmetical progressions giving divisors that will not succeed; but if there is any divisor, it will be found thus by means of these arithmetical progressions.\n\nIf the equation proposed has the coefficient of its highest term $\\neq 1$, then it will be $m = 1$, and the divisor will be $x - n$, and the rule will coincide with that given in the end of the last chapter, which we demonstrated after a different manner; for the divisor being $x - n$, the value of $x$ will be $+n$, the term of the progression that is a divisor of the sum that arises from supposing $x = 0$. Of this case we gave examples in the last chapter; and though it is easy to reduce an equation whose highest term has a coefficient different from unit, to one where that coefficient shall be unit, by p. 106, col. 1, par. 6.; yet, without that reduction, the equation may be resolved by this rule, as in the following\n\n**Exam.**\nExamp. Suppose $8x^3 - 26x^2 + 11x + 10 = 0$, and that it is required to find the values of $x$; the operation is thus;\n\n| Suppos. | Results | Divisors | Progr. |\n|---------|---------|----------|--------|\n| $x = 1$ | $+3, 1, 3$ | $3 \\times 3$ |\n| $x = 0$ | $-26x^2 + 11x + 10$ | $+10, 1, 2, 5, 10, 2$ |\n| $x = -1$ | $-35, 1, 5, 7, 35$ | $1 \\times 7$ |\n\nThe difference of the terms of the last arithmetical progression is 2, a divisor of 8, the coefficient of the highest term $x^3$ of the equation, therefore supposing $m = 2$, $n = 5$, we try the divisor $2x - 5$; which succeeding, it follows, that $2x - 5 = 0$, or $x = 2\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe quotient is the quadratic $4x^2 - 3x - 2 = 0$, whose roots are $\\frac{3 + \\sqrt{41}}{8}$, and $\\frac{3 - \\sqrt{41}}{8}$, so that the three roots of the proposed equation are $2\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{3 + \\sqrt{41}}{8}$, $\\frac{3 - \\sqrt{41}}{8}$. The other arithmetical progression gives $x + 2$ for a divisor; but it does not succeed.\n\nIf the proposed equation has no simple divisor, then we are to inquire if it has not some quadratic divisor (if itself is an equation of more than three dimensions.)\n\nAn equation having the divisor $mx^2 - nx + r$ may be expressed, as in the first article of this chapter, by $EXmx^2 - nx + r$; and if we substitute for $x$ any known quantity $a$, the sum that will result will have $ma^2 - na + r$ for one of its divisors; and, if we substitute successively for $x$ the progression $a, a - e, a - 2e, a - 3e, \\ldots$, the sums that arise from this substitution will have\n\n$$ma^2 - na + r$$\n\n$$m \\times a - e^2$$\n\n$$m \\times a - 2e^2$$\n\n$$m \\times a - 3e^2$$\n\nand so on, &c., among their divisors respectively.\n\nThese terms are not now, as in the last case, in arithmetical progression; but if you subtract them from the squares of the terms $a, a - e, a - 2e, a - 3e, \\ldots$, multiplied by $m$ a divisor of the highest term of the proposed equation, that is from\n\n$$ma^2$$\n\n$$m \\times a - e^2$$\n\n$$m \\times a - 2e^2$$\n\n$$m \\times a - 3e^2$$\n\n&c., the remainders,\n\n$$n - r$$\n\n$$n \\times a - e^2 - r$$\n\n$$n \\times a - 2e^2 - r$$\n\n$$n \\times a - 3e^2 - r$$\n\n&c., shall be in arithmetical progression, having their common difference equal to $nx$.\n\nIf, for example, we suppose the assumed progression $a, a - e, a - 2e, a - 3e, \\ldots$ to be $2, 1, 0, -1$, the divisors will be\n\n$$4m - 2n + r$$\n\n$$m - n + r$$\n\n$$+ r$$\n\n$$m + n + r$$\n\nwhich subtracted from $4m$, $m$, $0$, $m$, leave $2n - r$\n\n$$n - r$$\n\n$$- r$$\n\n$$- n - r$$\n\nan arithmetical progression whose difference is $+r$; and whose term, arising from the substitution of $0$ for $x$, is $-r$.\n\nFrom which it follows, that by this operation, if the proposed equation has a quadratic divisor, you will find an arithmetical progression that will determine to you $n$ and $r$, the coefficient $m$ being supposed known; since it is unit, or a divisor of the coefficient of the highest term of the equation. Only you are to observe, that if the first term $mx^2$ of the quadratic divisor is negative, then in order to obtain an arithmetical progression, you are not to subtract, but add the divisors $-4m - 2n + r$, $-m - n + r$, $+r$, $-m + n + r$, to the terms $4m$, $m$, $0$, $m$.\n\nThe general rule therefore, deduced from what we had said, is,\n\n\"Substitute in the proposed equation for $x$ the terms $2, 1, 0, -1, \\ldots$, successively. Find all the divisors of the sums that result, adding and subtracting them from the squares of these numbers $2, 1, 0, -1, \\ldots$, multiplied by a numerical divisor of the highest term of the proposed equation, and take out all the arithmetical progressions that can be found amongst these sums and differences. Let $r$ be that term in any progression that arises from the substitution of $x = 0$, and let $-r$ be the difference arising from subtracting that term from the preceding term in the progression; lastly, let $m$ be the foresaid divisor of the highest term; then shall $mx^2 - nx + r$ be the divisor that ought to be tried.\" And one or one of the divisors found in this manner will succeed, if the proposed equation has a quadratic divisor.\n\nChap. XXI. Of the Methods by which you may approximate to the Roots of Numerical Equations by their Limits.\n\nWhen any equation is proposed to be resolved, first find the limits of the roots (by chap. 17.) as for example, if the roots of the equation $x^2 - 16x + 55 = 0$ are required, you find the limits are $0, 8$, and $17$, by p. 110, col. 2, par. 2.; that is, the least root is between $0$ and $8$, and the greatest between $8$ and $17$.\n\nIn order to find the first of the roots, I consider, that if I substitute $0$ for $x$ in $x^2 - 16x + 55$, the result is positive, viz. $+55$, and consequently any number between $0$ and $8$ that gives a positive result, must be less than the least root, and any number that gives a negative result must be greater. Since $0$ and $8$ are the limits, I try $4$, that is, the mean between them, and supposing $x = 4$, $x^2 - 16x + 55 = 16 - 64 + 55 = 7$, from which I conclude that the root is greater than $4$. So that now we have the root limited between $4$ and $8$. Therefore...\nI next try 6, and substituting it for \\( x \\) we find \\( x^2 - 16x + 55 = 36 - 96 + 55 = -5 \\); which result being negative, I conclude that 6 is greater than the root required, which therefore is limited now between 4 and 6. And substituting 5, the mean between them, in place of \\( x \\), I find \\( x^2 - 16x + 55 = 25 - 80 + 55 = 0 \\); and consequently 5 is the least root of the equation. After the same manner you will discover 11 to be the greatest root of that equation.\n\nThus by diminishing the greater, or increasing the lesser limit, you may discover the true root when it is a commensurable quantity. But, by proceeding after this manner, when you have two limits, the one greater than the root, the other lesser, that differ from one another but by unit, then you may conclude the root is incommensurable.\n\nWe may however, by continuing the operation in fractions, approximate to it. As if the equation proposed is \\( x^2 - 6x + 7 = 0 \\), if we suppose \\( x = 2 \\), the result is \\( 4 - 12 + 7 = -1 \\), which being negative, and the supposition \\( x = 0 \\) giving a positive result, it follows that the root is between 0 and 2. Next we suppose \\( x = 1 \\); whence \\( x^2 - 6x + 7 = 1 - 6 + 7 = 2 \\), which being positive, we infer the root is betwixt 1 and 2, and consequently incommensurable. In order to approximate to it, we suppose \\( x = 1 \\frac{1}{2} \\), and find \\( x^2 - 6x + 7 = 2 \\frac{1}{4} - 9 + 7 = \\frac{1}{4} \\); and this result being positive, we infer the root must be betwixt 2 and \\( 1 \\frac{1}{2} \\). And therefore we try \\( 1 \\frac{1}{2} \\), and find \\( x^2 - 6x + 7 = 2 \\frac{1}{4} - 9 + 7 = \\frac{1}{4} \\), which is negative; so that we conclude the root to be betwixt \\( 1 \\frac{1}{2} \\) and \\( 1 \\frac{1}{4} \\). And therefore we try next \\( 1 \\frac{1}{4} \\), which giving also a negative result, we conclude the root is betwixt \\( 1 \\frac{1}{4} \\) (or \\( 1 \\frac{1}{4} \\)) and \\( 1 \\frac{1}{8} \\). We try therefore \\( 1 \\frac{1}{8} \\), and the result being positive, we conclude that the root must be betwixt \\( 1 \\frac{1}{8} \\) and \\( 1 \\frac{1}{16} \\), and therefore is nearly \\( 1 \\frac{1}{16} \\).\n\nOr you may approximate more easily by transforming the equation proposed into another whose roots shall be equal to 10, 100, or 1000 times the roots of the former, by p. 106, col. 1, par. 4, and taking the limits greater in the same proportion. This transformation is easy; for you are only to multiply the 2d term by 10, 100, or 1000, the 3d term by their squares, the 4th by their cubes, &c. The equation of the last example is thus transformed into \\( x^2 - 600x + 70000 = 0 \\), whose roots are 100 times the roots of the proposed equation, and whose limits are 100 and 200. Proceeding as before, we try 150, and find \\( x^2 - 600x + 70000 = 22500 - 90000 + 70000 = 2500 \\), so that 150 is less than the root. You next try 175, which giving a negative result must be greater than the root: and thus proceeding, you find the root to be betwixt 158 and 159: from which you infer, that the least root of the proposed equation \\( x^2 - 6x + 7 = 0 \\) is betwixt 1.58 and 1.59, being the hundredth part of the root of \\( x^2 - 600x + 70000 = 0 \\).\n\nIf the cubic equation \\( x^3 - 15x^2 + 63x - 50 = 0 \\) is proposed to be resolved, the equation of the limits will be (byp. 110, col. 2, par. 2,) \\( 3x^3 - 30x^2 + 63x - 50 = 0 \\), or \\( x^3 - 10x^2 + 21 = 0 \\), whose roots are 3, 7; and by substituting 0 for \\( x \\), the value of \\( x^3 - 15x^2 + 63x - 50 \\) is negative; and by substituting 3 for \\( x \\), that quantity becomes positive. \\( x = 1 \\) gives it negative, and \\( x = 2 \\) gives it positive, so that the root is between 1 and 2, and therefore incommensurable. You may proceed as in the foregoing examples to approximate to the root. But there are other methods by which you may do that more easily and readily; which we proceed to explain.\n\nWhen you have discovered the value of the root to be less than an unit (as, in this example, you know it is a little above 1), suppose the difference betwixt its real value and the number that you have found nearly equal to it, to be represented by \\( f \\); as in this example. Let \\( x = 1 + f \\). Substitute this value for \\( x \\) in the equation, thus,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx^3 - 15x^2 + 63x - 50 &= 1 + 3f + 3f^2 + f^3 \\\\\n- 15x^2 &= -15 - 30f - 15f^2 \\\\\n+ 63x &= 63 + 63f \\\\\n- 50 &= -50\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nNow because \\( f \\) is supposed less than unit, its powers, \\( f^2, f^3 \\), may be neglected in this approximation; so that assuming only the two first terms, we have \\( -1 + 36f = 0 \\), or \\( f = \\frac{1}{36} = .027 \\); so that \\( x \\) will be nearly 1.027.\n\nYou may have a nearer value of \\( x \\) by considering, that seeing \\( -1 + 36f - 12f^2 + f^3 = 0 \\), it follows that\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{1}{36 - 12f^2} = \\text{(by substituting } \\frac{1}{36} \\text{ for } f)\n\\]\n\nnearly \\( = \\frac{1}{36 - 12 \\times \\frac{1}{36} \\times \\frac{1}{36}} = \\frac{1296}{45216} = .02803 \\).\n\nBut the value of \\( f \\) may be corrected and determined more accurately, by supposing \\( g \\) to be the difference betwixt its real value and that which we last found nearly equal to it. So that \\( f = .027 + g \\). Then by substituting this value for \\( f \\) in the equation \\( f^3 - 12f^2 + 36f - 1 = 0 \\), it will stand as follows,\n\n\\[\nx = 1 + f = 1.02803923127; \\text{ which is very near the true root of the equation that was proposed.}\n\\]\n\nIf still a greater degree of exactness is required, suppose \\( b \\) equal to the difference betwixt the true value of \\( g \\) and\nand that we have already found, and proceeding as above you may correct the value of \\( g \\).\n\nIt is not only one root of an equation that can be obtained by this method, but, by making use of the other limits, you may discover the other roots in the same manner. The equation of p. 116. col. 2. par. 1. \\( x^3 - 15x^2 + 63x - 50 = 0 \\), has for its limits 0, 3, 7, 50. We have already found the least root to be nearly 1.028039.\n\nIf it is required to find the middle root, you proceed in the same manner to determine its nearest limits to be 6 and 7; for 6 substituted for \\( x \\) gives a positive, and 7 a negative result. Therefore you may suppose \\( x = 6 + f \\), and by substituting this value for \\( x \\) in that equation, you find \\( f^3 + 3f^2 - gf + 4 = 0 \\), so that \\( f = \\frac{4}{9} \\) nearly. Or,\n\nsince \\( f = \\frac{4}{9 - 3f - f^2} \\), it is (by substituting \\( \\frac{4}{9} \\) for \\( f \\))\n\n\\( f = \\frac{4}{9 - 3 \\cdot \\frac{4}{9} - \\left( \\frac{4}{9} \\right)^2} = \\frac{324}{805} \\), whence \\( x = 6 + \\frac{324}{805} \\) nearly. Which value may still be corrected as in the preceding articles.\n\nAfter the same manner you may approximate to the value of the highest root of the equation.\n\n\"In all these operations, you will approximate sooner to the value of the root, if you take the three last terms of the equation, and extract the root of the quadratic equation consisting of these three terms.\"\n\nThen, in p. 116. col. 2. par. 2. instead of the two last terms of the equation \\( f^3 - 12f^2 + 26f - 1 = 0 \\), if you take the three last, and extract the root of the quadratic \\( 12f^2 - 36f + 1 = 0 \\), you will find \\( f = 0.028031 \\), which is much nearer the true value than what you discover by supposing \\( 36f - 1 = 0 \\).\n\nIt is obvious that this method extends to all equations.\n\n\"By assuming equations affected with general coefficients, you may, by this method, deduce general rules or theorems for approximating to the roots of proposed equations of whatever degree.\"\n\n**Chap. XXII. Of the Rules for finding the Number of impossible Roots in an Equation.**\n\nThe number of impossible roots in an equation may, for most part, be found by this\n\n**Rule.** Write down a series of fractions whose denominators are the numbers in this progression, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &c., continued to the number which expresses the dimension of the equation. Divide every fraction in the series by that which precedes it, and place the quotients in order over the middle terms of the equation. And, if the square of any term multiplied into the fraction that stands over it gives a product greater than the rectangle of the two adjacent terms, write under the term the sign \\( + \\), but, if that product is not greater than the rectangle, write \\( - \\); and the signs under the extreme terms being \\( + \\), there will be as many imaginary roots as there are changes of the signs from \\( + \\) to \\( - \\), and from \\( - \\) to \\( + \\).\n\nThus, the given equation being \\( x^3 + px^2 + 3px - q = 0 \\), I divide the second fraction of the series \\( \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{3}{4} \\), by the first, and the third by the second, and place the quotients \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) and \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\), over the middle terms in this manner,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\nx^3 + px^2 + 3px - q = 0 \\\\\n+ & - & + & +\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThen because the square of the second term multiplied into the fraction that stands over it, that is, \\( \\frac{1}{2}x^2 \\times x^2 \\), is less than \\( 3p^2x^2 \\) the rectangle under the first and third terms, I place under the second term the sign \\( - \\); but as \\( \\frac{1}{2}x^2 \\times x^2 \\times x^2 \\) (\\( = 3p^2x^4 \\)) the square of the third term multiplied into its fraction is greater than nothing, and consequently much greater than \\( -pqx^4 \\), the negative product of the adjoining terms, I write under the third term the sign \\( + \\). I write \\( + \\) likewise under \\( x^3 \\) and \\( -q \\) the first and last terms; and finding in the signs, thus marked, two changes, one from \\( + \\) to \\( - \\), and another from \\( - \\) to \\( + \\), I conclude the equation has two impossible roots.\n\nWhen two or more terms are wanting in the equation, under the first of such terms place the sign \\( - \\), under the second \\( + \\), under the third \\( - \\), and so on alternately; only when the two terms to the right and left of the deficient terms have contrary signs, you are always to write the sign \\( + \\) under the last deficient term.\n\nAs in the equations\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\nx^5 + ax^4 & * & * & * & +a^2 = 0 \\\\\n+ & + & - & + & +\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\nx^5 + ax^4 & * & * & * & -a^2 = 0 \\\\\n+ & + & - & + & +\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nthe first of which has four impossible roots, and the other two.\n\nHence too we may discover if the imaginary roots lie hid among the affirmative, or among the negative roots. For the signs of the terms which stand over the signs below that change from \\( + \\) to \\( - \\), and \\( - \\) to \\( + \\), shew, by the number of their variations, how many of the impossible roots are to be reckoned affirmative; and that there are as many negative imaginary roots as there are repetitions of the same sign.\n\nAs in the equation\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\nx^5 - 4x^4 + 4x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x - 4 = 0 \\\\\n+ & + & - & + & +\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nthe signs (\\( - + - \\)) of the terms \\( -4x^4 + 4x^3 - 2x^2 \\) which stand over the signs \\( + - + \\) pointing out two affirmative roots, we infer that two impossible roots lie among the affirmative; and the three changes of the signs in the equation (\\( + - + - - \\)) giving three affirmative roots and two negative, the five roots will be one real affirmative, two negative, and two imaginary affirmatives. If the equation had been\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\nx^5 - 4x^4 - 4x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x - 4 = 0 \\\\\n+ & + & - & + & +\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nthe terms \\( -4x^4 - 4x^3 \\) that stand over the first variation \\( + - \\), shew by the repetition of the sign \\( - \\), that one imaginary root is to be reckoned negative, and the\nterms $-2x^2 - 5x$ that stand over the last variation $- +$, give, for the same reason, another negative impossible root; so that the signs of the equation $(+ - - - -)$ giving one affirmative root, we conclude that of the four negative roots two are imaginary.\n\nThis always holds good, unless, which sometimes may happen, \"there are more impossible roots in the equation than are discoverable by the rule.\"\n\n**ALH**","sp":126,"ep":150},{"h":"RULES","t":"I. Place the rate of the mixture on the left side of a brace, as the root; and on the right side of the brace set the rates of the several simples, under one another, as the branches.\n\nII.

Set the difference betwixt the root and the several branches, right against their respective yoke-fellows. These alternate differences are the quantities required.\n\nNote 1. If any branch happen to have two or more yoke-fellows, the difference betwixt the root and these yoke-fellows must be placed right against the said branch, one after another, and added into one sum.\n\nNote 2. In some questions, the branches may be alligated more ways than one; and a question will always admit of so many answers, as there are different ways of linking the branches.\n\nAlligation alternate admits of three varieties, viz.\n\n1. The question may be unlimited, with respect both to the quantity of the simples, and that of the mixture.\n\n2. The question may be limited to a certain quantity of one or more of the simples.\n\n3. The question may be limited to a certain quantity of the mixture.\n\nVariety I.\n\nWhen the question is unlimited, with respect both to the quantity of the simples, and that of the mixture, this is called Alligation Simple.\n\nExamp. A grocer would mix sugars, at 5 d., 7 d., and 10 d. per lb., so as to sell the mixture or compound at 8 d. per lb.: What quantity of each must he take?\n\nHere the rate of the mixture 8 is placed on the left side of the brace, as the root; and on the right side of the same brace are set the rates of the several simples, viz. 5, 7, 10, under one another, as the branches; according to Rule I.\n\nThe branch 10 being greater than the root, is alligated or linked with 7 and 5, both these being less than the root; as directed in Rule II.\n\nThe difference between the root 8 and the branch 5, viz. 3, is set right against this branch's yoke-fellow 10. The difference between 8 and 7 is likewise set right against the yoke-fellow 10. And the difference betwixt 8 and 10, viz. 2, is set right against the two yoke-fellows 7 and 5; as prescribed by Rule III.\n\nAs the branch 10 has two differences on the right, viz. 3 and 1, they are added; and the answer to the question is, that 2 lb. at 5 d., 2 lb. at 7 d., and 4 lb. at 10 d. will make the mixture required.\n\nThe truth and reason of the rules will appear by considering, that whatever is lost upon any one branch is gained upon its yoke-fellow. Thus, in the above example, by selling 4 lb. of 10 d. sugar at 8 d. per lb., there is 8 d. lost; but the like sum is gained upon its two yoke-fellows; for by selling 2 lb. of 5 d. sugar at 8 d. per lb., there is 6 d. gained; and by selling 2 lb. of 7 d. sugar at 8 d., there is 2 d. gained; and 6 d. and 2 d. make 8 d.\n\nHence it follows, that the rate of the mixture must always be mean or middle with respect to the rates of the simples; that is, it must be less than the greatest, and greater than the least; otherwise a solution would be impossible. And the price of the total quantity mixed, computed at the rate of the mixture, will always be equal to the sum of the prices of the several quantities cast up at the respective rates of the simples.\n\nVariety II.\n\nWhen the question is limited to a certain quantity of one or more of the simples, this is called Alligation Partial.\n\nIf the quantity of one of the simples only be limited, alligate the branches, and take their differences, as if there had been no such limitation; and then work by the following proportion.\n\nAs the difference right against the rate of the simple whose quantity is given,\nTo the other differences respectively;\nSo the quantity given,\nTo the several quantities sought.\n\nExamp. A distiller would, with 40 gallons of brandy at 12 s. per gallon, mix rum at 7 s. per gallon, and gin at 4 s. per gallon: How much of the rum and gin must he take, to sell the mixture at 8 s. per gallon?\n\nGal.\n8 12 1, 4 5 40 of brandy.\n7 4 4 32 of rum.\n4 4 4 32 of gin.\n\nThe operation gives for answer, 5 gallons of brandy,\n4 of rum, and 4 of gin. But the question limits the quantity of brandy to 40 gallons; therefore say,\n\nIf \\(5 : 4 :: 40 : 32\\)\n\nThe quantity of gin, by the operation, being also 4, the proportion needs not be repeated.\n\n**Variety III.**\n\nWhen the question is limited to a certain quantity of the mixture, this is called *Alligation Total*.\n\nAfter linking the branches, and taking the differences, work by the proportion following,\n\nAs the sum of the differences,\nTo each particular difference;\nSo the given total of the mixture,\nTo the respective quantities required.\n\n**Examp.** A vintner hath wine at 3 s. per gallon, and would mix it with water, so as to make a composition of 144 gallons, worth 2 s. 6 d. per gallon: How much wine, and how much water must he take?\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c}\n\\text{Gal.} & \\text{120 of wine.} \\\\\n30 & 30 \\\\\n0 & 6 \\\\\n\\hline\n36 & 144 \\text{ total.} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{120 \\times 36 = 4320}{24 \\times 0 = 0}\n\\]\n\nProof \\(144)4320(30\\)\n\nAs \\(36 : 30 :: 144 : 120\\)\nAs \\(36 : 6 :: 144 : 24\\)\n\nThere being here only two simples, and the total of the mixture limited, the question admits but of one answer.\n\n---\n\n**ALLIGATOR,** in zoology, a synonyme of the *lace-ta crocodilus.* See *Lacerta.*\n\n**ALLIGATOR-pear,** in botany.

Turn to the Index, and see whether the debtor of the Journal post to be transported be written there: If it be not, infer it under its proper letter, with the number of the folio to which it is to be carried.\n\n2. Upon the folio, and in the head of the space allotted for the accompt, write the title in a large text letter.\nfor ornament, making it Dr on the left side of the folio, and Cr on the right.\n\n3. Record the date in the columns on the margin of the Dr side, and write the Cr with the word To prefixed to it, immediately below the title, or other articles formerly posted; and complete the entry in one line, by giving a short hint of the nature and terms of the transaction, carrying the sum to the money-columns; and insert the quantity, if it be an account of goods, &c., in the inner columns, and the referring figure in the folio-column.\n\n4. Turn next to the creditor of the Journal post, and proceed in the same manner with it, both in the Index and Ledger; with this difference only, that the entry is to be made upon the Cr side, and the word By prefixed to it.\n\n5. The post being thus entered in the Ledger, return to the Journal, and, on the margin, mark the folios of the accounts, writing the folio of the Dr above, and the folio of the Cr below, a small line drawn between them, thus, . These marginal numbers in the Journal are a kind of Index to the Ledger, and are of use in examining the books, and on other occasions.\n\n6. In opening the accounts in the Ledger, follow the order of the Journal; that is, beginning with the first Journal post, allow the first space in the Ledger for the Dr of it, the next for the Cr, the third for the Dr of the following post, if it be not the same with some of those already opened; and so on till the whole Journal be transported.\n\nThe above six rules are formed for simple posts, where there is but one Dr and one Cr; but may easily be applied to complex ones: e.g., in posts where only one of the terms is complex, the simple term is entered Dr to, or Cr by Sundries, or Sundry-accounts, referring to the Journal for particulars. And the single Drs or Crs of the complex term, are each of them, in their respective accounts, entered Dr to, or Cr by the simple term. Again, in posts where both terms are complex, each particular Dr and Cr are entered Dr to, or Cr by, Sundry accounts, with a reference to the journal, as before. And here observe, that an article of Sundry-accounts has no referring figure in the folio-column, because it refers to several accounts: But this defect is supplied by the marginal numbers of the Journal, which must still be consulted before the particulars of the indefinite article can be known.\n\nHow to transpose an account from one folio to another.\n\nWhen the space allotted for an account proves too little: that is, when either the Dr or Cr side, or both, are so charged and filled with articles, that they can hold no more; the account must be transposed to a new space: Which may be done by one or other of the methods following.\n\n1. In all accounts that have inner columns for the quantities, such as Account of goods, &c., add up both the Dr and Cr sides, and charge the new account Dr to the old, for the total of the Dr side; and make the old account Dr to the new, for the total of the Cr side. Thus the old account will be evened; that is, the sums and quantities on both sides will be equal; and the new account will exhibit the same sums and quantities on its Dr and Cr sides, that the old did, before it was transposed.\n\n2. In accounts that have no inner columns, such as Personal accounts, Cash-account, Profit and Loss, &c., where the difference between the two sides is only considered, it is sufficient, after adding up both sides, as before, to carry the balance or difference only to the new account, by making it Dr to the old, for the said balance, if the Dr side of the old be heaviest; but if the Cr side be heaviest, then charge the old account Dr to the new. See No. 1. and 61.\n\nNote. The number of the folio on which the new account is opened, must be inserted in the Index, and also in the folio-column of the old account; and again, the folio-number of the old must be written in the folio-column of the new; that the accountant may readily turn from the one to the other, as occasion requires.\n\nHow the Books are examined.\n\nAn accountant should be at all imaginable pains in filling up the books, to make them exact and correct: But as errors must happen, the examination of the books after they are written up becomes absolutely necessary.\n\n1. The Waite-book being the first and fundamental book, the only means left for discovering errors in it, are, a careful reading of it, and comparing it with the accountant's memory, or the Book of letters, or Letters of correspondence, Bills, Invoices, &c.; or perhaps some accident or circumstance may happen to bring things to remembrance. And this, with calling up the sums of money anew, is all that can be done.\n\n2. In revising the Journal, compare each post with the Waite-book, to see if the sums of money be right, and whether the narrative or reason of the entry be justly expressed. Next, Consider whether the true Dr and Cr are assigned; and, after having thus narrowly examined the posts, and corrected what happens to be wrong, return to the Waite-book, and, on the margin opposite to the revised post, make a dash with the pen, thus, /, to signify that the Journal has been compared with it, and found right.\n\n3. The Ledger is revised or examined, by comparing it with the Journal, in the manner following. Take the Journal, and, beginning with the first post, turn (as the marginal numbers direct) to the folio of the Ledger where the Dr of the said post stands, and see whether it be duly entered: And, upon finding it right, return to the Journal, and affix to the marginal number of the said D., a dot or point, thus [,], to show that it has been examined. Next, Turn to the folio where the Cr is posted, and, upon finding it right, or after correcting it if wrong, return to the Journal, and affix a dot to its referring figure.\nfigure in the margin, for the same purpose as before. If there be more Drs or Crs in the post, proceed the same way with each of them. And thus go on with the next post, and after it with the third, &c. till the whole Journal and Ledger be compared.\n\nAs every thing is twice entered in the Ledger, once upon the Dr side of one account, and again upon the Cr side of some other account; it is plain, that the total sum of all the money on the Dr sides will be precisely equal to the total sum of all upon the Cr sides: And therefore the accountant, after revising the books, is next, for further satisfaction, to add up the Dr sides of the whole Ledger into one sum, and the Cr sides into another. If they agree, it is highly probable that all is right; if they differ, something is unquestionably wrong.\n\nThis addition of the Dr and Cr sides is, by merchants, called the Trial-balance; and ought to be made, not simply by taking the sum of every page, but by summing the Dr and Cr sides of every account separately, and then adding these on every page into one sum. By going to work in this manner, you lose no labour; for when you come afterwards to close the accounts, instead of adding their Dr and Cr sides anew, you take their sums from the trial-balance.\n\nIf, after the revise is made, the totals of the Dr and Cr sides agree, the accountant may, without further trial, conclude the books to be right. But if they differ, his next step is to examine the Ledger by itself. Which is done thus: Beginning with the first account, compare the first article on the Dr side with its counter-part (to which the referring figure directs), and, upon finding them right, or making them so, affix a dot to the end of the sum, or in the folio or month column of each of them, thus [\u2022], to signify that they have been compared. Proceed in like manner with all the other articles on the Dr side, and next with those upon the Cr side; and then go on to a new account, and from it to the following, till the whole Ledger be finished. Here observe, that, in prosecuting the examination, all the dotted articles you come to are to be omitted, as having been compared already. The Ledger, being thus examined, if the corrections of the errors found bring the sums of the Dr and Cr sides to a balance, the books may now be presumed right; but if not, something is still wrong: And there is no way left to discover the mistake, but a more careful research of the books.\n\nThis revising or examination is what merchants call Pricking of the books; and should not be put off till the Ledger is filled up, but performed weekly, and in due order; that is, the Waste-book should be revised, before it be posted to the Journal; and the Journal ought to be examined, before it be transported to the Ledger; and the revising of the Ledger finished, before the balance is begun.\n\nHow Errors are corrected.\n\nIn explaining the method of correcting errors, we shall join the Waste-book and Journal together, because the manner of correcting is the same in both; and then show the way of correcting mistakes in the Ledger.\n\n1. Errors in the Waste-book and Journal may be reduced to six classes, and corrected as follows.\n\n1st, If the errors be the omission of a whole post, the way to correct or supply the defect is, to write it in a separate place by itself, with a reference to it from the place where it should have been. 2dly, If only a word or two be wanting, they may be interlined or written upon the margin. 3dly, If a whole post be repeated, or twice written, it is corrected by cancelling one of them; but the cancelling ought to be done in such a flight manner, that the original writing may still be legible and distinct. 4thly, In like manner, if only a word or sentence be repeated, let one of them be slightly cancelled. 5thly, If there be any wrong name, word, or figure, the best way is, to let the wrong name, word, or figure, stand as they are, but correct the mistake by a note on the margin or foot of the page. 6thly, If you commit a mistake, and presently discover it in the very time of writing, the handsomest way of correcting it is, not to alter or cancel any thing, but to write the post or sentence anew, beginning with such a phrase as this, I say; as in the following example: Sold A. B., I say, Bought of A. B.\n\nII. Errors in the Ledger are of four sorts. 1st, When an article is entered upon a wrong account: This is to be corrected, first, by making the other side of the said account Dr to, or Cr by Error, for the sum of the said article; which rectifies this account: After which, the article must be entered in due form, in the account to which it belongs; or rather make the correction thus, viz. charge the one account Dr to the other, for so much per error. By either of these methods, the error is removed, and the purity of the books restored. 2dly, When an article is entered in the right account, but upon the wrong side; that is, upon the Dr side, when it should have been upon the Cr side, or vice versa; to correct this, the first thing to be done is, to remove the error, by making the other side of the said account Dr to, or Cr by Error, for the sum of the article: After which, the article must be entered anew upon the right side, as if no such blunder had happened. 3dly, When there is an error in a sum of money: This, if it be too little, is corrected by a new charge on the same side, for the defect; and if it be too much, the mistake is rectified by a discharge on the opposite side for the excess, viz. the account is debited or credited to, or by ditto person, or ditto goods, for so much short-posted, or overcharged. 4thly, When an article is quite forgot, or neglected, errors of this nature are easily adjusted, viz. by making the entry omitted; only observe, that it is not to be crowded in betwixt two former entries; in order to make it possess the place it would have done, had it come regularly in; for though the order, whatever it be, can occasion no error in the issue, yet this interlining would look more confused and irregular than the disorder of the date, which any person skilled in book-keeping will easily perceive to have happened through mistake.\n\nOf balancing the Ledger, and raising from it an Inventory, to begin a new Set of Books.\n\nMerchants commonly once a-year balance or close their Ledger, and raise from it the materials of an Inventory to a new set of books, for the ensuing year. Now,\nNow, to make the method of doing this plain and intelligible to a learner, it must be observed, that, by the word Balance, merchants understand the difference between the sums on the Dr and Cr sides of any account. Which difference being entered on the defective side, the account is said to be balanced; that is, to have the sums of the Dr and Cr sides evened, or made equal. And the sides of the several accounts throughout the Ledger being thus evened, and the total sums formally set down on the foot of the accounts, the Ledger is said to be balanced, closed, or finished. Again, in order to understand how the new Inventory is formed from the old Ledger, it must be observed, that these balances or differences of the sides of accounts, are of different kinds. In some accounts, the balance is, the gain or loss made upon the sale of goods; in some, the balance is, the price of goods remaining unsold; and in others, it is a debt due to, or by the merchant, &c. Now, balances of the first kind, viz. of gain or loss, must be distinguished from the rest, and carried to the Profit and Loss account; which being done, the balance or difference of its sides, will be the gain or loss made upon one year's trade, and goes to the Stock-account. All the other kinds of balances must be brought together into one space or folio, under the title of Balance-account, and are the very articles of which the Inventory is made up. The most natural method of balancing the Ledger is, first to point out what is contained upon the Dr and Cr sides of each account, and consequently what the balances are; and then, to show the mercantile and approved way of going to work, in closing the Ledger, collecting the balances, and converting them into a new Inventory. This we shall do in the form of problems.\n\nPROB. I.\n\nWhat the Balances in the Accounts of proper Trade are.\n\n\u00a7 1. What the Balances in proper domestic Trade are.\n\n1. Cash-account, No. 1. and 61.\n\nContains, upon the Dr side, the ready money which the merchant had at first, or when the books were begun; together with all he has received since that time. The Cr side contains all the payments he has made, or the money he has given out. So that the difference of the two sides is, the ready money he has by him; and therefore this account is closed, by being credited by Balance, for the said difference.\n\n2. An Account of Goods, No. 2. 3. 11. 12. 14. 18. 20. 21. 27. &c.\n\nContains upon the Dr side, the prime cost and charges; and, upon the Cr side, the sale or disposal of them. So that there are here three varieties. 1. When the goods are all disposed of, which is known by the inner columns being equal, the difference of its sides is, the gain or loss made upon the sale; and so is closed, by charging it Dr to Profit and Loss, for the gain, if the Cr side be heaviest; or giving it credit by Profit and Loss, for the loss, if the Dr side be heaviest. No. 2. 11. 14. 18. &c. 2. When none of the goods are disposed of, which will appear by the Cr side being empty, then it is closed by Balance, for the whole sum on the Dr side. No. 21. 27. &c. 3. When only part of the goods are disposed of, which will appear by the inequality of the quantity-columns; this case requires commonly two closing entries, viz. First, the account must be credited by Balance, for the goods remaining, valued at the prime cost; which equals the inner columns: After this, if the money-columns be unequal, it must be made Dr to, or Cr by Profit and Loss, for the gain or loss made upon what are sold; which evens the outer columns, and closes the account. No. 3. 12.\n\nNote 1. If the goods are of different kinds or prices, as they should be distinguished, when posted to the Ledger, by different numbers, or separate inner columns; so care must be taken, in balancing the account, to mention the kind of goods remaining unsold, and to value them at their own prices.\n\nNote 2. A merchant may, at any time, know what goods he has on hand, by comparing the inner columns of the Accounts of Goods, without being put to the trouble of inspecting his warehouse, and weighing or measuring the goods themselves.\n\nNote 3. If there be lack or outcome of goods, that is, defect or excess in weight or measure, it will happen, when the goods are all disposed of, that the inner columns will not be equal. In this case, the balance or equality must be restored, by inserting as much in the deficient column as will make it equal to the other, writing the words In lack, Broke, Lost in weight, Ullaged, Outcome, or the like, before it, as the reason why it is added: but nothing goes to the money-columns.\n\n3. Plate and Jewels.\n\nThis account contains, on the Dr side, the things of that kind you are possessed of; and, like an account of goods remaining on hand, is closed, by being credited by Balance.\n\n4. Personal accounts, No. 5. 6. 7. 9. 10. 13. 15. &c.\n\nContain, upon the Dr side, the debts due by the person to the merchant, with the payments made upon any other score by the merchant to him. The Cr side contains the payments made by the person to the merchant, with the debts due by the merchant to the said person, upon any other dealings. So that there are here two cases. 1st, If the Dr side be heaviest, the difference is a debt due by the person to the merchant. No. 13. 24. &c. 2ndly, If the Cr side be heaviest, the difference is a debt due by the merchant to the person. No. 15. 57. And in both cases the account is closed, by making it Dr to, or Cr by Balance, for the difference of its sides.\n\n5. Bills receivable, No. 25.\n\nThis is a general personal account, and contains upon the Dr side, bills accepted, and payable to the merchant. The Cr side contains the payments he has received. So that the difference of its sides (if there be any) is, what is yet unpaid: And the account is closed, by giving it credit by Balance, for the said difference.\n\n6. Bills\n6. Bills payable, No 52.\n\nThis is an accompt of the same nature with the former; and contains, upon the Cr side, the bills accepted by the merchant, payable to others; and, upon the Dr side, the payments he has made. So that the difference of the sides (if there be any) is the bills yet unpaid: And the accompt is closed, by charging it Dr to Balance.\n\n7. Bills of Exchange.\n\nThis accompt exhibits, on the Cr side, all the bills you draw on your factors or correspondents; and the Dr side shows what of them are accepted, protested, or yet outstanding; and is closed, if the sides happen to be unequal, by being debited to Balance, for the bills outstanding, viz., the bills of whose acceptance you have hitherto had no advice.\n\n8. Bonds.\n\nThis accompt exhibits, on the Dr side, all the bonds you have received, and on the Cr side, what of them are paid, or outstanding; and is closed, if the sides happen to be unequal, by being credited by Balance, for the bonds yet unpaid.\n\n9. Suspense-accompt, No 34.\n\nContains, upon the Dr side, the goods sent off; and upon the Cr side, either the same goods returned, or advice from your correspondent that he designs to keep them, or the price sent up. So that either the sides of this accompt are equal, and then the accompt closes of itself; or, if there be any difference, it is owing to your having hitherto had no advice concerning some of the goods sent off; and in this case the accompt is closed, by being credited by Balance, for the said difference.\n\n10. Foreign Coin, No 26.\n\nContains, upon the Dr side, the value at which the several pieces are received; and on the Cr side, the value at which they are put off. In closing this accompt, there are three cases. If, the pieces are all disposed of, the accompt is closed, by being debited or credited to or by Profit or Loss, for the gain or loss made by them. 2dly, If none of the pieces are yet disposed of, it is closed by being credited by Balance, for the whole value on the Dr side. 3dly, If part of them are disposed of, and part of them yet on hand; in this case, the accompt must first be credited by Balance, for value of the pieces on hand; and if after this the money-columns still remain unequal, it must be debited or credited to or by Profit and Loss, for the said difference; which is the gain or loss made upon the pieces disposed of.\n\n11. Wagers Accompt.\n\nContains, upon the Dr side, the consignments made when the wagers were entered into. The Cr side contains the decisions of the wagers. So that here occur two varieties, viz., 1st, If all the wagers are determined, the difference of the sides will be the gain made upon those decided in favour of the merchant; and the accompt is closed, by being charged Dr to Profit and Loss, for the said difference. 2dly, If any of the wagers are yet undecided, the accompt must first be credited by Balance for them: After which, if the sides are still unequal, it must be charged Dr to Profit and Loss, for the difference.\n\n12. Decreas'd Person's Estate.\n\nThe Dr side of this accompt exhibits the legacies, bills, or debts, you the executor have paid on account of the person deceased; and the Cr side shows what he died possessed of: And the accompt is closed, by being made Dr to Profit and Loss, for the difference of its sides; which is the sum that falls to you the executor.\n\n13. Accompts of Ships, Houses, and other Possessions, No 4.\n\nContain, upon the Dr side, what they cost at first, or are valued at, with all charges, such as repairs, or other expenses laid out upon them. The Cr side contains, (if any thing be writ upon it), either what they are sold or exchanged for, or the profits arising from them; such as freight, rent, &c. Here there are three cases. If nothing be written upon the Cr side, it is closed, by being credited by Balance. 2dly, If the Cr side be filled up, with the price of the ship, house, &c., sold, or otherwise disposed of, then the difference of the sides is the gain or loss made upon the sale; and the accompt is closed, by being debited or credited to or by Profit and Loss. 3dly, If the Cr side contain only the freight or rent; in this case, first charge the ship, house, &c., Dr to Profit and Loss, for the freight or rent; and then close the accompt with Balance. No 4.\n\n14. House-expenses, Charges of Merchandize, Refusal of Bargains, Interest-accompt, Insurance accompt, and all others of the like nature, that are disbursements for which nothing comes in, or pure incomes for which nothing goes out. No 65. 42. 35.\n\nContain, upon their Dr sides, the articles of loss, and upon the Cr sides the articles of gain; and are closed, by being debited or credited to or by Profit and Loss, for the difference of their sides.\n\n15. Profit and Loss, No 38.\n\nContains, upon the Dr side, the articles of loss, and on the Cr side the articles of gain. To this accompt are carried, not only whatever comes in course to it from the Journal, but also all the articles of gain and loss that occur in closing the Ledger-accompts. After which, the Dr and Cr sides being added up, their difference is the neat gain or loss made since the books were begun; and therefore this accompt is closed, by being debited or credited to or by Stock, for the difference of its sides.\n\n16. Stock-accompt, No 8.\n\nAs gathered from the Journal, contains, upon the Dr side, the debts due by the merchant when the books were begun. The Cr side contains his ready money, effects, and debts due to him at the same time. But then, to this accompt, as it now stands, there is brought, at closing of the Ledger, the difference of the sides of the Profit and Loss accompt. After which, the Dr and Cr sides being added up, and compared, their difference will be the merchant's present neat stock; and the accompt is closed by Balance.\n\u00a7 2. What the Balances in proper Foreign Trade are.\n\n1. Voyage to, or from \u2014\u2014\u2014, No 16. 40. 47.\nContains, upon the Dr side, the prime cost and charges of the cargo. The Cr side is either empty, or it contains the receipt or disposal of the goods by the factor, or perhaps returns made for them. There are therefore here two cases. If the Cr side be empty, the ship is still at sea, or, at least, there has been as yet no advice of her arrival; and the accompt is closed, by giving it credit by Balance. If the Cr side be filled up, the difference of the sides is the gain or loss made upon the voyage; and accordingly the accompt is closed by being made Dr or Cr to or by Profit and Loss. If the sums of the sides happen to be equal, there is neither gain nor loss on the voyage; and the accompt closes of itself.\n\n2. A. B. my Accompt of Goods.\nContains, upon the Dr side, the goods consigned to, and received by the factor; and on the Cr side, the disposal of the said goods. This accompt balances exactly as an Accompt of goods in proper domestic trade.\n\n3. A. B. my Accompt on Time.\nContains, upon the Dr side, the debts due to the factor, for my goods sold by him on time. The Cr side contains the payments made by debtors to the factors. So that, if there be any difference of the sides, it is the debts yet outstanding: And the accompt is closed, by giving it credit by Balance.\n\n4. A. B. my accompt-current, No 41. 53.\nContains, upon the Dr side, the money in the factor's hands, received by him of the sales of my goods, with the remittances I had sent him, or payments I have made him upon any other account. The Cr side contains the payments or remittances he has sent me, with the debts I owe him upon any other score. In closing this accompt, there are two cases. If the inner columns, which contain the foreign money, be equal; then, if there be any difference between the outer columns, it is the gain or loss made by exchange; which flows from the different rates of exchange at which these debts have been charged and discharged: And the accompt in this case is closed, by being made Dr to or Cr by Profit and Loss, for the difference of the outer columns. If the inner columns are unequal, they must first be brought to an equality, by making the accompt Dr to, or Cr by Balance, for their difference, valuing the foreign money at the current rate of exchange; which difference is a debt due by the factor if the Dr side be heaviest, but due to the factor if the Cr side be heaviest. If after this the outer columns are unequal, their difference is, the gain or loss made by exchange; and the accompt must be closed, by making it Dr to or Cr by Profit and Loss, for the said difference.\n\nPROB. II.\n\nWhat the Balances in Factory-accompts are.\n\n1. A. B. his Accompt of Goods, No 48.\nThis accompt contains, upon the Dr side, the charges paid by the factor. The Cr side contains the sale or disposal of the goods. In closing this accompt, there are five varieties. If the goods are all sold, and all the money received, this accompt is balanced, by being charged Dr, first to Profit and Loss, for the factor's commission, at so much per cent. after which, the difference of the sides is, the money due to the employer; and is closed, by being again charged Dr to A. B. his Accompt-current, for the said difference. If the goods are all sold, but no money yet received, it is closed, by being made Dr to Profit and Loss, for the factor's commission, and to A. B. his Accompt on Time, for the out-standing debts due to him. If the goods are all sold, and only part of the money received, it is closed, by being made Dr to Profit and Loss, for the factor's commission; to A. B. his Accompt on Time, for the out-standing debts; and to A. B. his Accompt-current, for the employer's money in factor's hands. If none of the goods be yet sold, it is closed, by giving it credit by Balance, for the sum of the charges on the Dr side. If only part of the goods are sold, and so the accompt unfinished, the best way to close it is, by a double balance; that is, first charge it Dr to Balance, for the sum upon the Cr side; and then give it credit by Balance, for the charges on the Dr side. Thus the accompt will appear in the new books in the same state that it did in the old.\n\n2. A. B. his Accompt on Time, No 49.\nContains, upon the Cr side, the debts due by those who bought the employer's goods; and as these debts are paid in to the factor, it is charged Dr to A. B. his Accompt-current, for the said payments; and therefore, if, at closing of the Ledger, there be any difference of its sides, it is the debts yet outstanding; and is closed, by being charged Dr to Balance, for the said difference.\n\n3. A. B. his Accompt-current, No 36. 50.\nContains, upon the Dr side, the money laid out by the factor for the employer's use, as in answering his bills, or remitting bills to him, or otherwise. The Cr side contains the money in the factor's hands belonging to the employer. So that the difference of its sides is, the debts due by the factor to A. B. or by A. B. to him; and the accompt is closed, by being made Dr or Cr to or by Balance.\n\nNote, If the factor dispose of the employer's good on trust, to persons with whom he has private dealings of his own, it will be proper, in closing their accompts, to divide the balance into two parts, viz., one due for the employer's goods, and the other due to or by himself.\nPROB. III.\n\nWhat the Balances in Company-accounts are.\n\n\u00a7 1. What the Balances in the Accounts kept by a Partner are.\n\n1. A.B. my Account in Company, No 54:\nContains, upon the Dr side, the partner's inputs, and share of charges; upon the Cr side, the returns made; and the difference is the gain or loss. In balancing this account, there are two cases. If, if the account be finished, i.e., if the goods be sold, and returns made, it is closed, by being made Dr or Cr to or by Profit and Loss. 2dly, If the account be yet unfinished, the best way is, to close it with a double balance; that is, to make it Dr to Balance, for the sum of the Cr side, and give it credit by Balance, for the sum of the Dr side.\n\n2. A.B. my Account-proper, No 55.\nThis account is merely personal; and closed with Balance, for the difference of its sides; which is the debt due to, or by the company.\n\n\u00a7 2. What the Balances of the Accounts kept by a Trustee in his own Books are.\n\nBefore the trustee close the company's accounts, he ought to make the double Journal entry following, if it be not done already; namely, 1st, Goods in Company, or Voyage, &c. Dr to Sundries, viz., to Cash, for all charges not yet stated to account, such as cellar-rent, &c.; and to Profit and Loss, for his own commission, at so much per cent. 2dly, Each partner's Account-proper Dr to his Account in Company, for their respective shares of the above charges and commission. These entries being made, the balances of the accounts are as follows.\n\n1. Goods in Company, No 58, 62, 71, 74.\nContains, upon the Dr side, the prime cost of the goods stocked in, with all charges, and the trustee's commission. The Cr side contains the disposal of them. The difference of the sides is gain or loss, to be divided amongst the partners. Here there are three cases. If the goods be all sold, the account is closed, by being debited or credited to or by Sundries, viz., to, or by each partner's Account in company, for their shares of the gain or loss; and to, or by Profit and Loss, for the trustee's own share. 2dly, If none of the goods are sold, then the account is closed, by being credited by Sundries; viz., by each partner's Account in Company, for their shares of the goods unsold; and by Balance, for the trustee's share. 3dly, If part of the goods are sold, and part of them yet remain not disposed of, this case is a compound of the two former; and accordingly the account is closed, by making the entry mentioned in the first case, for the gain or loss on those sold; and then, by making the entry mentioned in the second case, for those not disposed of.\n\n2. Voyage in Company, No 66.\nContains, upon the Dr side, the value and charges of the goods sent to sea. The Cr side contains the receipt or disposal of them by the factor. The difference of the sides is gain or loss. Here there are three cases. 1st, If the Dr and Cr sides be equal, then the account closes of itself. 2dly, If one of the sides exceed the other, then the account is closed, by being made Dr or Cr to or by Sundries; viz., to, or by each partner's Account in Company, for their shares of the gain or loss; and to, or by Profit and Loss, for the trustee's share. 3dly, If nothing be yet written upon the Cr side, then the account is closed, by being credited by Sundries, viz., by each partner's Account in Company, for their shares of the goods at sea; and by Balance, for the trustee's share.\n\n3. Factor our Account of Goods.\nContains, upon the Dr side, the company's goods consigned to, and received by the factor. The Cr side contains the disposal of them. The difference of the sides is gain or loss made upon the sale of them. This account has the same varieties, and is balanced the same way with Goods in company.\n\n4. Factor our Account-current.\nContains, upon the Dr side, what money belonging to the company is in the factor's hand. The Cr side contains the returns he has made in goods or bills. The difference is the debt due to or by the factor. This account is closed, by being made Dr or Cr to or by Balance, for the said difference.\n\n5. Partner his Account in Company, No 59, 69, 70.\nContains, upon the Cr side, the partner's inputs, with his share of charges, and of gain at close. The Dr side contains returns for inputs disposed of, or goods remaining unsold, with the partner's share of losses, if any. This account, after the preceding accounts are balanced, will always close of itself; as is evident by considering what goes to the two sides of it: so that if the balance of this account fail, the accountant may conclude, for certain, that something in the company's accounts is wrong, or at least some mistake has happened in closing them.\n\n6. Partner his Account-proper, No 60, 67, 68.\nIs a personal account, the difference of whole sides is the debt due to or by the partner, and is closed with Balance.\n\nNote. If the design of balancing the company-accounts be, not in order to know the state of the company's affairs, but only that the old Ledger may be finished, and the accounts carried to new books; the accountant, in this case, may either balance them as above directed; or he may, if he pleases, close all of them by a double balance; which is the easiest and shortest way, and will have the same effect in the issue.\n\n\u00a7 3. What the Balances of the Accounts kept by a Trustee in separate Books are.\n\n1. Goods in Company, and Voyage in Company,\nHave the same things upon their Dr and Cr sides, as when.\nwhen kept in books along with other business; but are closed with Profit and Loss in Company, for the gain or loss; and with partners Accompts in company, for their respective shares of goods remaining unfold, or at sea.\n\n2. Cash in Company,\n\nContains, upon the Dr side, the sums of money given in by partners, and received from dealers for goods sold; the Cr side contains the sums laid out; so that the difference of its sides is the money on hand; and is closed with Balance in company.\n\n3. Partner his Accompt in Company,\n\nContains the same thing upon its Dr and Cr sides respectively, as when kept in books along with other business; and, after the accompts of goods and voyages are balanced, will always close of itself.\n\n4. Partner his Accompt proper.\n\nThis and all personal accompts, as they contain the same things upon their Dr and Cr sides, as their parallels, in proper trade, so they are all closed with Balance in company.\n\n5. Profit and Loss in Company.\n\nThe difference of its sides is the gain or loss made upon company-trade, and must be charged Dr to the trustee his Accompt proper, for his commission; after which, it is closed, (if no Stock-accompt is kept), by being made Dr or Cr to or by Sundries, viz. Each partner his accompt in company, for the respective shares of gain or loss. But if you keep a Stock-accompt in company, then this accompt is closed with it; and the Stock-accompt is again closed with the partners Accompts in company.\n\n6. Balance in Company,\n\nContains, upon the Dr side, the company's ready money in the trustee's hand, with the debts to the company, whether by partners or dealers; the Cr side contains the debts due by the company, and that whether to partners or to dealers: And if the books have been rightly kept, and duly balanced, the two sides of this accompt will always equal one another to a farthing.\n\nNote. If you include the goods remaining unfold, or at sea, should appear upon the Balance-accompt, you must close the Accompt of goods and Voyages with Balance in company, for the value of the quantity not disposed of, or at sea; and you may close the partners Accompts in company (which in this case will not close of themselves), either with their Accompts proper, or with Balance in company, as you please.\n\nHow the Balances are collected, the Ledger closed, and a new Inventory formed.\n\nWhen you design to balance your Ledger, in order to begin a new set of books, proceed in the manner following.\n\nTake two sheets or folios of loose paper, rule them like the Ledger, and write on the heads or tops of them, the titles of the two following Accompts, viz. on the head of the one, Profit and Loss Dr, and Contra Cr; on the other, Balance Dr, and Contra Cr. Then, beginning with the Accompt of cash, go over every accompt in the Ledger, (omitting only the Accompts of Profit and Loss and Stock, which must be left open to the last), and carry the articles of gain or loss found on any of them, to the Profit and Loss sheet; and the articles of debt, or goods remaining, to the Balance sheet, without touching the accompts themselves: e.g. Taking from the Trial-balance the sums of the Dr and Cr sides of the Cash-accompt, subtract the one sum from the other, and, on the Balance sheet, make Balance Dr to Cash, for their difference, being the ready money in your hands. Again, in an Accompt of goods that are all sold, taking the sums of the Dr and Cr sides, subtract the one from the other, and, on the other sheet, make Profit and Loss Dr or Cr to or by Stock, for their difference: Which difference being carried to the Stock-accompt, add up its Dr and Cr sides, and carry their difference to the Balance sheet. Which being done, the total sums of the Dr and Cr sides of the Balance sheet will be equal to a farthing, if the books be right, and the balancing work truly performed: As may be thus demonstrated.\n\nIt is obvious, that the Balance sheet, before the balance of the Stock-accompt is brought to it, contains, upon the Dr side, the money and goods you have on hand, or at sea, or in the hands of factors, with the debts due to you; the articles on the Cr side are the debts due by you to others: So that the difference of its sides is your present worth, or neat stock. Now, if the balance of the Stock-accompt be also equal to your present neat stock, it is plain, that it will even the sides of the Balance-accompt. But that it is so, appears thus.\n\nYour present neat stock is equal to your neat stock when the books were begun, with the addition of the gain, or diminution of the loss, made since that time: but the difference of the sides of Stock accompt, before the balance of Profit and Loss accompt be brought to it, is your neat stock when the books were begun; and the balance of Profit and Loss accompt, is the gain or loss made since that time; which, consequently, being brought to Stock-accompt, makes the balance of Stock-accompt equal to your present neat stock; and therefore the balance of Stock-accompt evens the sides of Balance-accompt.\n\nIf, after the balance of Stock-accompt is brought to Balance-accompt, the sides happen to be still unequal, there has unquestionably some error been committed; which you must find out by a careful review of the balancing work: for here the error must lie, since the books are supposed to have been examined, and found right, or made so, before the balancing was begun. On the other hand, if the sides of Balance-accompt be equal, all\nall may be presumed right. There is not, indeed, an absolute certainty in the case: for, if you imagine two mistakes committed, either both in the articles of Profit and Loss, or both in the articles of Balance, or one in the former, and the other in the latter, both excesses, or both defects, equal, and on opposite sides, it is plain this would not impede the equality of the Dr. and Cr. sides of the Balance-account. But then this is so great a chance, that it is more than probable such a thing can never happen, and pass too, without being discovered.\n\nHaving brought the two sides of the Balance-account to an equality, which is the test of every thing being right, proceed to close the Ledger-accounts, thus. First, to the Profit and Loss account, transfer the articles on the Profit and Loss sheet. Next, at the end of the Ledger, erect an Account of Balance, into which transcribe the Balance sheet. After which, return to the beginning of the Ledger, and giving the Cash-account credit by Balance, for your ready money, draw a line across the money-columns on each side, at the foot of the account; below which set down the total sums, which will be now equal. Proceed in like manner with all the following accounts, transferring to each the respective articles that belong to them, from the two sheets of loose paper, inserting the referring figures in the folio-column, and writing the total sums on the foot of the account; by which means all the accounts in the Ledger will come to be balanced and closed; that is, evened and finished.\n\nBut here it will be proper to observe, that merchants, in balancing their Ledger, do not all go the same way to work. For some, instead of proceeding according to the above directions, close their Ledger-accounts, and post the closing entries to the Accounts of Profit and Loss, and Balance, all at the same time. And it must be owned, that this way, practised with care, will well enough answer the purpose; but to post the closing entries in the first place, and then to close the accounts, seems to be the surer and better method.\n\nThe Ledger being now closed, the next thing to be done is, to begin a new set of books; in order to which, a new inventory must be fetched from your old books, as the foundation of your future trade in the new. Now, it is plain, at first view, that the several articles on the Dr. side of the Balance-account, being the particular items of your effects, and debts due to you, make up the first part of the Inventory; and the several articles on the Cr. side, except the last, being the debts due by you to others, make up the second part of it: and accordingly in your new Journal, the several particulars on the Dr. side must all of them be made Drs to Stock, and Stock Dr to the several particulars on the Cr. side; and Stock-account in your New Ledger will stand thus:\n\nStock Dr,\nTo Jacob Ruffel,\nTo H.

Frequent solution in water, and evaporation of it again, is one of these. This transmutation then of these salts, which are not volatilised or washed away, must be continually going on in the cloth under these alternate waterings and dryings of the former process; not much indeed after the first two or three buckings; because the salts, not having entered deep into the cloth, are easily washed off, or evaporated. But when they penetrate into the very composition of the last and minutest fibres, of which the first vessels are made, they find greater difficulty of escaping again, and must be more subject to this transmutation. But if we consider the bleaching\nbleaching ashes as a composition of lime and alkaline salts, we must discover a fresh fund for the deposition of this absorbent earth. The common caustic, a composition of this very kind, soon converts itself, if exposed to the open air, into a harmless earthy powder.\n\nFrequent buckings and bleachings load the cloth with this substance. It becomes then necessary to take it out. No washing can do that, because earth is not soluble in water. Nothing but acids can remove it. These are attracted by the absorbent earth, join themselves to it, and compose a kind of neutral imperfect salt, which is soluble in water; and therefore easily washed out of the cloth. The acid liquors commonly used are butter-milk, which is reckoned the best, four milk, infusions of bran, rye-meal, &c., kept for some days till they sour. Sour whey is thought to give the cloth a yellow colour.\n\nThe linen ought to be dried before it is put in the four, that the acid particles may penetrate, along with the watery, through the whole. A few hours after it has been there, air-bubbles arise, the liquor swells, and a thick scum is formed; manifest signs of a fermentation. The following experiment, says Dr Home, shows the degree of heat which attends it.\n\n\"May 25. I put a thermometer of Fahrenheit's into some butter-milk, of which the bleachers were composing their fours, and which stood in a vat adjoining to another, where the milk was the same, and the souring process had been going on for two days. After the thermometer had been twenty minutes in the butter-milk, the mercury stood at 64 degrees. In the souring vat it rose to 68 degrees. An increase of 4 degrees shows a pretty brisk intestine motion.\"\n\n\"To what are all these effects owing? To the acetous fermentation going on in those vegetable liquors, whose acids, extricating themselves, produce heat, intestine motion, and air-bubbles. As the change is slow, the process takes five or six days before it is finished. During this time the acid particles are continually uniting themselves to the absorbent earth in the cloth. That this fermentation goes on in the liquor alone, appears from this consideration, that the same effects, viz., air-bubbles, and scum, are to be seen in the butter-milk alone. The only effect then it has is, by the small degree of heat, and intestine motion, which attend it, to affect the junction of the acid and absorbent particles. We shall presently see, that this process may be carried on, to as great advantage, without any fermentation; and therefore it appears not absolutely necessary.\n\n\"When these absorbent particles are fully saturated, the remaining acids may unite with, and have some small effect in extracting the colouring particles. This appears from the two following experiments.\n\n\"Sept. 20. A piece of cloth which had been steeped, weighing 41\u00bd gr., was put into a half-pound of butter-milk, whipped, and well soured, by a mixture of water, and by boiling. Sept. 24. When taken out, and washed in water, it appeared a very little whiter. The mineral acids, as will appear afterwards, whiten cloth, even though they are very much diluted.\n\n\"Just before the acetous fermentation is finished, the cloth should be taken out; otherwise the scum will fall down, and lodge in the cloth, and the putrefaction which then begins will weaken it. This appears from the following experiment.\n\n\"Sep. 16. A piece of cloth, weighing 42 gr., was laid in butter-milk unwhipped. Novem. 15. The milk had a putrid smell. The cloth was a little whiter, but very tender; and weighed, when well washed in warm water and dried, 40 gr.\"\n\nAll the fours made of bran, rye-meal, &c., ought to be prepared before use; for by this means so much time will be saved. Besides, when the water is poured upon the cloth, and bran, as is done in the management of coarse cloth, the linen is not in a better situation than if it had been taken up wet from the field; and by this means the acid particles cannot penetrate so deep. Again, this method of mixing the bran with the cloth, may be attended with yet worse consequences. All vegetable substances, when much pressed, fall into the putrefactive, and not the acetous fermentation. This often happens to the bran pressed between the different layers on the linen, which must weaken the cloth. Hence, all fours should be prepared before the cloth is steeped in them; and none of the bran or meal should be mixed with the cloth.\n\nThe fours are used strongest at first, and gradually weakened till the cloth has attained to its whiteness. In the first sourings, there is more of the earthy matter in the cloth, from the many buckings it has undergone, than what there can be afterwards. As the quantity of this matter decreases, so should the strength of the four. There is not, however, the least danger, at any time, from too strong a four.\n\nWhat is most wanted in this operation is a more expeditious and cheaper method of obtaining the same end. As it takes five or six days, it retards the whitening of the cloth considerably; and as bleachers are obliged to send for milk to a great distance, it becomes very dear. This last consideration makes them keep it so long, that, when used, it can have no good effect; perhaps it may have a bad one.\n\nThere is one consideration that may lead us to shorten the time. It is observed, that the souring process is sooner finished in warm than in cold weather. Heat quickens the fermentation, by aiding the intestine motion. The vats therefore should not be buried in the ground, as they always are, which must keep them cold; there should rather be pipes along the walls of the room, to give it that degree of heat, which, on trial, may be found to answer best. There are few days in summer so hot as is necessary; and the beginning and end of the season is by much too cold. That this is no ideal scheme, the following fact is a sufficient proof. There are two vats in Salton bleachfield, adjoining to a partition-wall, at the back of which there is a kitchen fire. In these vats the souring process is finished in three days, whereas it lasts five or six days in the others placed round the same room.\n\nThis improvement, though it shortens the time of souring a very little, yet is no remedy against the scarcity and dearth of milk fours. Such a liquor as would serve our purpose, must be found either among the vegetable\ntable acids, which have no further fermentation to undergo, or among the mineral acids. The former are a large class, and contain within themselves many different species; such as the acid juice of several plants, vinegars made of fermented liquors, and acid salts, called tartaric. But there is one objection against these vegetable acids: They all contain, along with the acid, a great quantity of oily particles, which would not fail to discolour the cloth. Besides, the demand of the bleachfields would raise their price too high.\n\nThe mineral acids have neither of these objections. They are exceedingly cheap, and contain no oil. \"I will freely own,\" says Dr Home, \"that at first I had no great opinion of success from the mineral, from two reasons; their want of all fermentation, which I then looked on as necessary; and their extreme corrosiveness. But the experience of two different summers, in two different bleachfields, has convinced me, that they will answer all the purposes of the milk and bran fours; nay, in several respects, be much preferable to them. I have seen many pieces of fine cloth, which had no other fours but those of vitriol, and were as white and strong as those bleached in the common way. I have cut several webs through the middle, and bleached one half with milk, and the other with vitriol; gave both the same number of operations, and the latter were as white and strong as the former.\"\n\nThe method in which it has been hitherto used is this. The proportion of the oil of vitriol to the water, with which it is diluted, is half an ounce, or at most three quarters, to a gallon of water. As the milk-fours are diminished in strength, so ought the vitriol-fours. The whole quantity of the oil of vitriol to be used, may be first mixed with a small quantity of water, then added to the whole quantity of water, and well mixed together. The water should be milk-warm; by which means the acid particles will penetrate further, and operate sooner. The cloth should then be put dry into the liquor.\n\nIt is observed, that this four performs its task much sooner than those of milk and bran; so that Mr John Chrystie, in making the trial, used to lay the milk-fours twenty-four hours before the vitriol. Five hours will do as much with this four, as five days with the common sort. But the cloth can receive no harm in allowing it to remain for some days in the four; but rather, on the contrary, an advantage. The cloth is then taken out, well rinsed, and mill-washed in the ordinary way.\n\nThe liquor, while the cloth lies in this four, is less acid the second day than the first, less the third than the second, and so diminishes by degrees. At first it is clear, but by degrees a mucilaginous substance is observed to float in it; when put into a glass. This foulness increases every day. This substance, extracted by the acid, is the same with what is extracted by the alkaline salts, and blunts the acidity of the former, as it does the alkalinity of the latter. Hence the liquor loses by degrees its acidity. But as the acid salts do not unite so equally with oily substances as the alkaline do, the liquor is not so uniformly tinged in the former as in the latter case, and the mucous substance presents itself floating in it.\n\nVOL. I. No. 24.\n\nIt is observed, that, in the first souring, which is the strongest, the liquor, which was a pretty strong acid before the cloth was put in, immediately afterwards becomes quite vapour; a proof how very soon it performs its task. But in the following operations, as the linen advances in whiteness, the acidity continues much longer; so that in the last operations the liquor loses very little of its acidity. This happens although the first buckings, after the first sourings, are increased in strength, while the fours are diminished. There are two causes to which this is owing. The texture of the cloth is now so opened, that although the lyes are strong, the alkaline salts and absorbent earth are easily washed out; and the oily particles are, in a great measure, removed which help to blunt the acidity of the liquor.\n\nTwo objections are made against the use of vitriol-fours. One is, that the process of souring with milk is performed by a fermentation; and, as there is no fermentation in the vitriol-fours, they cannot serve the purpose so well; The other, that they may hurt the texture of the cloth. The answer to the former objection is very short; that the vitriol-fours operate successfully without a fermentation, as experience shows; and therefore in them a fermentation is not necessary.\n\nAs to the latter objection, that oil of vitriol, being a very corrosive body, may hurt the cloth; that will vanish likewise, when it is considered how much the vitriol is diluted with water, that the liquor is not stronger than vinegar, and that it may be safely taken into the human body.\n\nThat it may be used with safety, much stronger than what is necessary in the bleachfield, appears from the following experiment with regard to the stamping of linen. After the linen is boiled in a lye of ashes, it is bleached for some time. After this, in order to make it receive the colour, it is steeped in a four of water and oil of vitriol, about fifteen times stronger than that made use of in the bleachfield; for, to 100 gallons of water are added two and a half of oil of vitriol. Into this quantity of liquor, made so warm as the hand can just be held in it, is put seven pieces of 28 yards each. The linen remains in it about two hours, and comes out remarkably whiter. The fine cloth often undergoes this operation twice. Nor is there any danger if the oil of vitriol is well mixed with the water. But if the two are not well mixed together, and the oil of vitriol remains in some parts undiluted, the cloth is corroded into holes.\n\nLet us now take a view of the advantages which the vitriol-fours must have over the milk. The latter is full of oily particles, some of which must be left in the cloth: But the case is worse when the scum is allowed to precipitate upon the cloth. The former is liable to neither of these objections.\n\nThe common fours hasten very fast to corruption; and if, from want of proper care, they ever arrive at that state, must damage the cloth very much. As the milk is kept very long, it is often corrupted before it is used; and, without acting as a four, has all the bad effects of putrefaction. The vitriol-fours are not subject to putrefaction.\n\nThe milk takes five days to perform its task, but the\nvitriol-fours do it in as many hours; nay, perhaps as many minutes. Their junction with the absorbent particles in the cloth must be immediate, whenever these acid particles enter with the water. An unanswerable proof that the fact is so, arises from the circumstances which happen when the cloth is first steeped in the vitriol-four; the cloth has no sooner imbibed the acid liquor than it loses all acidity, and becomes immediately vapid. This effect of vitriol fours must be of great advantage in the bleachfield, as the bleachers are at present hindered from enjoying the season by the tediousness of the souring process. The whole round of operations takes seven days; to answer which they must have seven parcels, which are often mixing together, and causing mistakes. As three days, at most, will be sufficient for all the operations when vitriol fours are used, there will be no more than three parcels. The cloth will be kept a shorter time in the bleachfield, and arrive sooner at market.\n\nThe milk-fours are very dear, and often difficult to be got; but the vitriol are cheap, may be easily procured, and at any time.\n\nThere is yet another advantage in the use of vitriol, and that is its power of whitening cloth. Even in this diluted state, its whitening power is very considerable. We have already seen, that it removes the same colouring particles, which the alkaline lyes do. What of it then remains, after the alkaline and absorbent particles are neutralized in the cloth, must act on these colouring particles, and help to whiten the cloth. That this is really the case appears from the following fact. Mr Chrystie being obliged to chuse twenty of the whitest pieces out of a hundred, five of the twenty were taken out of seven pieces which were bleached with vitriol.\n\nFrom both experience and reason, it appears, that it would be for the advantage of our linen-manufacture to use vitriol in place of milk-fours.\n\n**Hand-rubbing with Soap and Warm Water, Rubbing-Boards, Starching, and Bluising.**\n\nAfter the cloth comes from the souring, it should be well washed in the washing-mill, to take off all the acid particles which adhere to its surface. All acids decompose soap, by separating the alkaline salts and oily parts from one another. Were this to happen on the surface of the cloth, the oil would remain; nor would the washing-mill afterwards be able to carry it off.\n\nFrom the washing-mill the fine cloth is carried to be rubbed by women's hands, with soap and water. As the liquors, which are generally employed for souring, are impregnated with oily particles, many of these must lodge in the cloth, and remain, notwithstanding the preceding milling. It is probable, that all the heavy oils are not evaporated by bleaching. Hence it becomes necessary to apply soap and warm water, which unite with, dissolve, and carry them off. It is observed, that if the cloth, when it is pretty white, gets too much soap, the following bleaching is apt to make it yellow; on that account they often wring out the soap.\n\nIt is a matter worth inquiring into, whether hard or soft soap is best for cloth. Most bleachers agree, that hard soap is apt to leave a yellowness in the cloth. It is said, that the use of hard soap is discharged in Holland. As there must be a considerable quantity of sea-salt in this kind, which is not in the soft, and as this salt appears prejudicial to cloth, the soft soap ought to be preferred.\n\nThe management of the coarse cloth is very different, in this operation, from fine. Instead of being rubbed with hands, which would be too expensive, it is laid on a table, run over with soap, and then put betwixt the rubbing-boards, which have ridges and grooves from one side to another, like teeth. These boards have small ledges to keep in the soap and water, which saves the cloth. They are moved by hands, or a water wheel, which is more equal and cheaper. The cloth is drawn, by degrees, through the boards, by men who attend; or, which is more equal and cheaper, the same water-wheel moves two rollers, with ridge and groove, so that the former enters the latter, and, by a gentle motion round their own axis, pull the cloth gradually through the boards.\n\nThis mill was invented in Ireland about thirty years ago. The Irish bleachers use it for their fine, as well as coarse cloth. These rubbing-boards were discharged, some years ago, in Ireland, by the Trustees for the manufactures of that country, convinced from long experience of their bad effects. But as proper care was not taken to instruct the bleachers by degrees in a safer method, they continued in the old, made a party, and kept possession of the rubbing-boards. There were considerable improvements made in them in this country; such as the addition of the ledges, to keep the cloth moist; and of the rollers, which pull the cloth more gradually than men's hands. These improvements were first made in Salton bleachfield.\n\nThe objections against these rubbing-boards, are unanswerable. By rubbing on such an unequal surface, the solid fibrous part of the cloth is wore; by which means it is much thinned, and in a great measure weakened before it comes to the market. As a proof of this, if the water which comes from the cloth in the rubbing-boards be examined, it will be found full of cottony fibrous matter. These boards give the cloth a cottony surface, so that it does not keep long clean. Again, they flatten the threads, and take away all that roundness and firmness, which is the distinguishing property of cloth bleached in the Dutch method.\n\nFor these reasons they must be very prejudicial to fine cloth, and should never be used in bleaching it. As they seem to be, in some measure, necessary to lessen the expense of bleaching coarse linen, they ought never to be used above twice, or thrice at most. They might be rendered much more safe, by lining their insides with some soft elastic substance, that will not wear the cloth so much as the wooden teeth do. Mr Chrystie at Perth has lined his boards with short hair for some years past, and finds that it answers very well.\n\nAfter the coarse linen has undergone a tubbing, it should be immediately milled for an hour, and warm water poured now and then on it to make it lather. This milling has very good effects; for it cleans the cloth of all\nall the dirt and filth which the rubbing-boards have loofened, and which, at the next boiling, would discolour the cloth. Besides, it is observed, that it makes the cloth less cottony, and more firm, than when whitened by rubbing alone.\n\nThe last operation is that of starching and bluing. It often happens, that the cloth, when exposed to the weather to be dried after this operation, gets rain; which undoes all again, and forces the bleacher to a new expense. To remedy this inconvenience, Mr Chryffie, some years ago, invented the dry-house, where the cloth may be dried, after this operation, in any weather. This invention meets with universal approbation.\n\nA METHOD OF BLEACHING SAFELY WITH LIME.\n\nDr Home has found by repeated trials, that alkaline salts added to lime, diminish its power of weakening and corroding cloth; and that in proportion to the quantity of these salts added to the lime. This composition, as it is not so dangerous as lime alone, so it is not so expeditious in whitening. When equal parts of each are used, the whitening power is strong, and the weakening power not very considerable; so that they might be used with safety to bleach cloth, in the proportion of one part of lime to four of pure alkaline salts. This fully accounts for an observation made by all bleachers, that the bleaching salts, when mixed together, operate safer and better than when used separately. For the corrosive power of the Muscovy, Marcost, and Cathub ashes is corrected by the pearl ashes, and the whitening quality of the latter is increased by that of the former.\n\nThere is not a more corroding substance, with regard to animals, than alkaline salts and lime joined together, especially when fused in the fire. This is the composition of the common caustic. But lime, and lime-water alone, preserve animal substances in a sound entire state. It appears then surprising, that salts and lime should be found so little destructive of cloth, when lime, or lime-water alone, destroys it so remarkably. But that this is a fact, is made evident by many experiments, and has been practised both with success and safety, by a bleacher who gives the following account of his method of bleaching with lime.\n\n\"First, says he, I steep the cloth in warm water for twenty-four hours; then clean it in a washing mill, of all the dressing, or fowen, as the vulgar term it. Afterwards I buck the cloth with cow-dung and water, and bleach it with this for three days; then clean it again, and boil it with a lye made of Cathub ashes. A pound to each piece of 18 or 20 yards long is sufficient. This I do twice, as no lime ought to be given to cloth before it is a full third whitened; yet it by no means advances the whitening of the cloth, but, on the contrary, protracts it: For, instead of loosening the oil and dirt in the cloth, when brown, it rather fixes them; just as when fine cloth is bucked with over-warm lyes in the first buckings. Lime is by no means fit for discharging the oil in the cloth, but for cleaning it of the dead part, commonly called sprat. The cloth, being cleaned, is laid upon a dreaper. It must not be drier before bucking with lime, otherwise it will take in more than can be got out again before the next application: For as I have observed already, that lime is only fit for discharging the dead part, bucking thus wet make it rest on the outside of the cloth. I take a lippy of the finest and richest powdered lime that can be got, of the brightest white colour, as poor lime does more hurt than good, to thirty pieces of the above length; and make a cold lye of it, by stirring and pouring water off the lime, until all be dissolved, but the dros, which is thrown away: Then I add a little soap, which makes the lye have the nearest resemblance to milk that breaks in boiling, of anything I can think of: For this soap blunts the hornets of the lime. Then I take the cloth, and dip it in the lime-lye, and that moment out again, and lay it on a dreaper until it be bucked; then put it on the field, watering it carefully; for if allowed to dry, it is much damaged. This is done always in the morning; as it cannot be done at night, in regard of the hot quality of the lime, which soon heats the cloth, and tenders it. If a hot sunshine follows, it has great effect; for lime is just like all other materials for bleaching, that have more or less effect according as the weather is good or bad. I take it up the second day after bucking, and give it a little milling, or hand-bleaching, or bittling, commonly called knocking; and lay it on the field again, watering it carefully as before. The effect is more visible the second than the first day. As all cloth when limed should have a great deal of work, otherwise more than half the effect is lost; and not only that, but a great deal of labour and pains is requisite to take the lime out of the cloth again; it must never be exposed on the Sabbath day, but carefully kept wet always while used in this way. Thus bucking for three or four times at most, is sufficient for any cloth, except that made of flax pulled either over-green, or which grows in a drouthy season, or perhaps not so well heckled as it should be. This fort occasions great trouble and expense to the bleacher. But the most effectual and expeditious way I ever found for this kind, was, after boiling, to take a little of the warm lye, and mix a very small quantity of lime with it, and draw the cloth through that as hot as possible, and put it on the field directly, watering it carefully. This will clean it of the sprat surprisingly. Then I boil it with pearl ashes, and give it the last boil with soap.\n\n\"There are innumerable mistakes in the use of lime committed by the vulgar, who are ignorant of its quality and effects. They know only this in general, that it is a thing which whitens cloth cheap, and is easy purchased; therefore they will use it. Some of them begin whitening of their cloth with it, which I have already observed to be wrong, and given reasons for it, and continue it until the cloth is bleached; give it a boil or two at most, and then wash it up while the gross body of the lime is in the substance of the cloth. This makes limed cloth easily distinguishable from unlimed; as the former has a yellowish colour, and is full of a powder. Besides, as lime is of a very hot corroding nature, it must by degrees weaken the cloth. The bad effects of this substance do not end here. When the cloth is put on board, it con-\ntracts a dampness, which not only makes it yellow, and let any thing of colour it has, but directly rots it. And although it should escape this, which it is possible it may, by a quick and speedy passage; yet whenever it is put in any warehouse, it will meet with moisture there, especially if the winter-season should come on before it is disposed or made use of. These I take to be the principal reasons for so much complaint in bleaching with this material.\n\nThe whole art and safety in using the lime, according to this method, depends on the junction of the alkaline salts, during the bucking, to the particles of lime which were on the surface of the cloth.","sp":675,"ep":680},{"h":"SPLEEN","t":"The spleen is a bluish mass, something inclined to red, and of a long oval figure, being about seven or eight fingers-breadth in length, and four or five in breadth. It is of a softish substance, and is situated in the left hypochondrium, between the great extremity of the stomach, and the neighbouring false ribs, under the edge of the diaphragm, and above the left kidney.\n\nThe inner or concave side is divided by a longitudinal groove or fissure, in two planes or half-sides, one upper, the other lower; and by this groove, the vessels and nerves enter in human subjects. The superior half-side is broader and more concave than the inferior, being proportioned to the convexity of the great extremity of the stomach. The inferior half-side lies backward on the left kidney, and forward on the colon; and sometimes this side of the spleen appears to have two superficial cavities, one answering to the convexity of the stomach, the other to that of the colon. The convex side of the spleen is turned to the left ribs.\n\nOMENTUM & APPENDICES EPITHELIC\u00c6.\n\nThe omentum is a large, thin, and fine membranous bag, surrounded on all sides by numerous portions of fat, which accompany and even invest the same number of arteries and veins adhering closely to each other.\n\nThe greatest part of it resembles a kind of flat purse or a sportman's empty pouch, and is spread more or less on all the small intestines from the stomach to the lower part of the regio umbilicalis. Sometimes it goes down to the lower part of the hypogastrum, and sometimes does not reach beyond the regio epigastrica. It is commonly plaited or folded in several places, especially between the bands of fat.\n\nIt is divided into a superior and inferior, an anterior and posterior, and a right and left portion. The superior portion is in a manner divided into two borders, one of which is fixed along the great curvature or convex side of the arch of the colon, and the other along the great curvature of the stomach. The commissure or union of these two borders on the right side, is fixed to the common ligament or adhesion of the duodenum and colon.\ncolon, and to the contiguous parts of these intestines. That on the left side is fixed to the longitudinal fissure of the spleen, to the extremity of the pancreas, and to the convex side of the great extremity of the stomach. It is likewise fixed to the membranous ligament which sustains the ductus cholecdochus, and connects it to the vena porta ventralis.\n\nBelow these adhesions, the other portions, that is, the anterior, posterior, two lateral and inferior portions, which last is the bottom of the succus epiploicus, have commonly no fixed connections, but lie loose between the fore-side of the cavity of the abdomen and intestines.\n\nThe membrane of the omentum is throughout its whole extent made up of two extremely thin laminae joined by a cellular substance; the quantity of which is very considerable along the blood-vessels, which it every where accompanies in broad bands, proportioned to the branches and ramifications of these vessels. These cellular bands are more or less filled with fat according to the corpulency of the subject.\n\nBesides this large membranous bag, there is another much smaller, which differs from the large one, not only in size, but also in figure, situation and connexion; and this is the little omentum. This small bag is fixed by its whole circumference, partly to the small curvature of the stomach, and partly to the concave side of the liver before the sinus of the vena porta, so as to surround and contain the prominent portion of the lobulus.\n\nThe little omentum is thinner and more transparent than the other, and its cavity diminishes gradually from the circumference to the bottom. Its structure is pretty much the same with that of the great omentum, it being composed of two laminae, with a mixture of the same portions of fat, which are considerably finer than in the other.\n\nThe fatty appendices of the colon and rectum appear to be a kind of small omenta or appendices epiploicae. They are situated at different distances along these intestines, being particular elongations of their common or external coat. They are of the same structure with the great omenta, and there is a cellular substance contained in their duplicature, more or less filled with fat, according as the subject is fat or lean.\n\nUses of the Abdominal Viscera.\n\nThe intestines in general finish what the stomach had begun. The alimentary pulp having been sufficiently prepared by the succus galricus, or lymph of the stomach, undergoes a further change by the intestinal lymph, bile, and pancreatic juice, by which the milky liquor called chyle is produced, and this liquor rendered fluid enough to enter the lacteal vessels through the tunic villosa of the small intestines, while the grosser portion of the aliment continues its course, and becoming gradually thicker as it advances toward the great intestines, is there collected by the name of feces.\n\nThe valve of the colon, which might more properly be termed sphincter or pylorus of the ileum, hinders the feces from returning into the small intestines.\n\nThe glandular lacunae of the intestines furnish continually a kind of mucilage, which not only defends the internal coat from the acrimony of the feces, but serves also to lubricate these feces in proportion to their different degrees of solidity.\n\nThe intellitium rectum is the last reservoirary of the feces. The great thickness of its muscular coat, and the great number of longitudinal fibres by which this thickness is chiefly formed, enable it to yield to the collected feces to so great a degree, as to represent a large bladder or stomach. The muscular levatores ani serve to suspend the lower portion of this intestine, especially when full; and it is partly by the contraction of these muscles which overcome the sphincter of the anus, that the feces are discharged out of the body. These sphincters form the third pylorus of the whole alimentary canal.\n\nThe mesentery and mesocolon connect the intestines, in such a manner, as that they cannot be twisted or run into knots, without hindering them from sliding and yielding to each other according to the different postures of the body, or according as they are more or less empty or full.\n\nThe adhesions of the mesentery form the convolutions of all the small intestines into a large bundle, irregularly round, which fills a great part of the cavity of the abdomen, from the epigastrium downward.\n\nThe mesocolon by its adhesion to the colon forms a kind of septum transversum, between the small intestines and the viscera contained in the epigastrium; and this septum supports the liver and stomach under the arch of the diaphragm, just as much as it is sustained by the intestines.\n\nThe breadth of the mesentery and mesocolon affords a large extent to the ramifications of the arteries, veins, and nerves, distributed through them by innumerable communications and anastomoses, by means of which any portion of the intestines may be supplied, though the principal branch which leads to it should happen to be compressed or obstructed.\n\nThe cellular substance in the duplicature of the mesentery and mesocolon, serves not only for a soft bed to all these ramifications, but also to contain those collections of fat necessary for the formation of the bile; and the cellular substance of the mesentery has likewise one use peculiar to it, which is to invest the lymphatic glands and lacteal vessels, and upon this account it is thicker than that of the mesocolon.\n\nThe lacteal vessels being first formed by a copious reticular texture round the circumference of the intestines; resembling the vascular network of that canal, and afterwards uniting everywhere through the duplicature of the mesentery, with the arterial ramifications which they likewise accompany in many places; it is easy to conceive, that the pulsation of the mesenteric arteries must propel the chyle in the lacteal vessels from the intestines to the receptaculum chyli, that motion being suitable to the direction of their valves.\n\nThe liver is the principal organ for the secretion of the bile. The villi of that immense number of glandular cells of which it is composed, filtrate continually from the blood of the vena porta; small drops of bile, which afterwards infuse themselves into the pori bilarii, and...\nare in part lodged in the vesicula fellea, and in part run directly into the duodenum.\n\nThe spleen, omentum, appendices epiploicae, adipose strata of the mesentery, and those of the great intestines, and even the pancreas, with the whole series of glands in the intestinal canal, seem to contribute to the formation of the bile, as so many auxiliary or rather preparatory organs.\n\nThe vesicular bile appears to be more exalted than that in the hepatic duct; and by meeting in the ductus choledochus, they seem to compose a third kind of bile, which without the cystic or vesicular bile would perhaps be too mild, and too acrid without the hepatic. This bile mixes in the duodenum with the pancreatic juice, and with that of the intestinal glands; and from this mixture a fluid results, which is proper to separate the chylous matter from the gros and useless part of the alimentary pulp, as it comes from the stomach.\n\n**RENES & URETERES.**\n\nThe kidneys are two pretty solid, glandular bodies, situated in the posterior part of the cavity of the abdomen, on each side of the lumbar vertebrae, between the last false ribs and offa ileum. The right kidney lies under the great lobe of the liver, and is consequently lower than the left, which lies under the spleen.\n\nThe figure of the kidneys resembles that of a large bean, their circumference being convex on one side, and concave on the other. The concave side is turned to the vertebrae, and the convex side the opposite way.\n\nIn each kidney we observe a fore and back side, an upper and lower extremity, a great and small curvature, and a convexity and concavity.\n\nThe back-side is broader than the fore-side; and the upper extremity is a little broader and more incurvated than the lower. The depression in the small curvature is oblong and uneven, resembling a sinus, surrounded by several tubercles; and as it is turned a little toward the fore-side, this side is something narrower than the other.\n\nThe kidneys are surrounded by a very loose membranous and cellular covering, called membrana adiposa, because in fat persons the cells of this substance are filled with fat.\n\nThe proper coat or membrane of the kidneys is composed of two laminae, between which there is likewise a very fine cellular substance, which may be made sensible by blowing through a pipe between the two laminae.\n\nThe external lamina is very thin, and adheres closely to the internal lamina, by means of the cellular substance. The internal lamina penetrates everywhere, by numerous elongations, into the substance of the kidney, from which it cannot be separated without tearing.\n\nThe surface of the external lamina is very smooth, polished and glistering, and it renders the whole surface of the kidney very even and uniform.\n\nThe blood-vessels having entered the kidneys, are ramified every way; and these ramifications send out other capillary rami, which go all the way to the surface, where they appear like irregular stars, and furnish the proper membrane of the kidneys.\n\nThe proper membrane having surrounded the kidney all the way to the sinus, joins the vellus at that place, and accompanies all their ramifications through the body of the kidney, in form of a vagina or capsula.\n\nWe may distinguish three kinds of substances in the kidney; an exterior substance, which is thick, granulated, and in a manner cortical; a middle substance, which is medullary and radiated, called striata, fulcata, or tubularis, because it seems to be made up of radiated tubes; and an inner substance, which is only a continuation of the second, and terminates on the inside by papillae, for which reason it is called papillaris.\n\nThe papillae, which are only a continuation of the medullary substance, are often a little paler than that substance. They are ten or twelve in number, very distinct from each other, resembling the same number of cones, with very broad bases and obtuse apices.\n\nAt the point of each papilla we see, even without a microscope, in a small depression, several very small holes, through which little drops may be perceived to run when the papillae are compressed. These are little drops of urine, which being filtrated, partly in the cortical, partly in the medullary or tubular substance, do afterwards pass through the substance of the papillae, and are discharged by these orifices.\n\nEach papilla lies in a kind of membranous calyx or infundibulum, which opens into a common cavity called the pelvis. This pelvis is membranous, being of the same structure with the calices, of which it is a continuation; and its cavity in man is not uniform, but distinguished into three portions, each of which contains a certain number of infundibula or calices, together with the papillae which lie therein.\n\nAt the place where these infundibula surround the bases of the papillae, they send productions into the medullary or radiated substance of the kidney, which accompany the blood-vessels, and serve for capsula or vaginae to all the vascular arches, both arterial and venal, and to their different ramifications, quite through the cortical substance, and as far as the surface of the kidney.\n\nAfter the infundibula have contracted in a conical form round the apices of the papillae, each of them forms a small short tube or gullet, which, uniting at different distances along the bottom of the sinus of the kidney, form three large tubes, which go out from the sinus in an oblique direction from above downwards, and immediately afterwards unite into one trunk.\n\nThis trunk becomes a very long canal, called the ureter. In men the three tubes supply the place of what is called the pelvis in brutes, and might properly be called the roots or branches of the ureters than the pelvis. The ureters are commonly two in number, one for each kidney.\n\nThe situation of the trunk, and of the roots and branches of each ureter, with respect to the renal artery and vein, is in the following manner: The artery is in the upper part of the sinus, and partly before the vein. The vein is about the middle, and between the artery and ureter. The ureter is in the lower part, a little behind the vein, and it is partly surrounded by one branch of the artery.\nThe ureters run down obliquely, and with a very small degree of inflection, from the kidneys to the lateral parts of the inner or anterior side of the os sacrum, and passing between the rectum and bladder they terminate in the last of these viscera.\n\nThey are composed of three proper coats; the first of which, that surrounds the rest, is of a whitish colour, and of a very compact filamentary texture, being stretched with difficulty, and appearing like a filamentary substance degenerated. The next coat is of a reddish colour, stronger than the first, and made up of different strata of fibres, which intersect each other; but it is very hard to determine, whether they are muscular, or simply membranous.\n\nGLANDUL\u00c6 RENALES, vulgo CAPSUL\u00c6 ATRABILARIAE.\n\nImmediately above each kidney, lies a glandular body, called by the ancients capsulae atrabiliariae; by others capsulae renales, renes succenturiati, and glandulae renales. They are situated on the upper extremity of each kidney a little obliquely, that is, more toward the inner edge and sinus of the kidney than toward the outer convex edge.\n\nEach gland is an oblong body with three sides, three edges, and two points, like an irregular crescent with its great or convex edge sharp, and the small concave edge broad. Its length is about two thirds of the greatest breadth of the kidney, and the breadth of its middle portion is about one third of its extent between the two extremities, sometimes more, sometimes less. Its colour is a dark yellow.\n\nIt has one anterior, one posterior, and one lower side, which last may be termed the basis; and it has one upper, and two lower edges, whereof one is anterior, the other posterior. The upper edge may be called the crista, and the two lower edges the labia.\n\nThe surface of these glands is uneven; the foreside is the broadest, and the lower side or basis the narrowest. Along the middle of the anterior side, a ridge runs from the edge of the inner extremity, a little above the basis, to the point of the other extremity, and divides this side into two equal parts, like the middle rib of the leaf of a tree; and on the lower side, under the basis, there is a kind of raphe or suture.\n\nThe blood vessels of these glands come from the arteries, and veins renales, and diaphragmatic\u00e6, and likewise from the aorta and vena cava, from the arteria c\u00e6liaca, &c. These vessels are termed the capsular arteries and veins; and as they enter the glands, they seem to be invested by a vagina.\n\nIn the inside of these capsules, there is a narrow triangular cavity, the surface of which is full of short strong villi of a yellowish colour; but in children it is reddish, and of a dark brown in aged people. The sides of this cavity are connected by a great number of filaments, and they appear to be wholly glandular, that is, to be filled with very fine small folliculous corpuscles.\n\nThis cavity contains an unctuous viscid liquor, of a yellowish red colour, which with age changes gradually into a yellowish purple, a dark yellow, and a black yellow; and sometimes it is perfectly black; but even then, if it be spread thin on a large surface, it appears yellow.\n\nThe uses of these renal glands have not as yet been discovered; and all that we know about the liquor contained in them, is, that it resembles the bile. They are very large in the fetus, and diminish in adults.","sp":316,"ep":319},{"h":"TABLE","t":"3d Period. 2d Period. 1st Period.\n\nBillions. Millions. Units.\n\nHundred thousands. Ten thousands.

A fraction, or broken number, is any part or parts of an unit; and is expressed by two numbers, which are separated from one another by a line drawn betwixt them; the under number being called the denominator, and the upper one the numerator, of the fraction; as $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{3}{4}$, $\\frac{9}{10}$.\n\n3. A mixt number is an integer with a fraction joined to it; as $4\\frac{1}{2}$, $7\\frac{3}{4}$, $48\\frac{9}{10}$.\n\n4. A number is said to measure another number, when it is contained in that other number a certain number of times, or when it divides that other number without any remainder. Thus, 3 measures 6, 9, or 12.\n\n5. An even number is that which is measured by 2; or which 2 divides without any remainder; as 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12.\n\n6. An odd number is that which 2 does not measure, or which cannot be divided by 2, without a remainder; as 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13.\n\n7. A prime number is that which unity, or itself, only measures; as 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19.\n\n8. A composite number is that which is measured by some other number than itself, or unity; as 12, which is measured by 2, 3, 4, or 6.\n\n9. Numbers are called prime to one another, when unity only measures them. Thus 13 and 36 are prime to one another; for no number, except unity, measures both.\n\n10. Numbers are called composites to one another, when some number, besides unity, measures them. Thus 12 and 18 are composite to one another; for 3 or 6 measures both of them.\n\n11. A number which measures another is called an aliquot part of that other. Thus 6 is an aliquot part of 18, and 3 of 12, and 5 of 20.\n\n12. The number measured, or which contains the aliquot part a certain number of times, is called a multiple of that aliquot part. Thus 18 is a multiple of 6, and 12 of 3.\n\n13. A number is called an aliquant part of another, when it does not divide that other without a remainder. Thus 7 is an aliquant part of 24.\n\n14. Two, three, or more numbers, which, multiplied together, produce another number, are called the component parts of the number produced. Thus 3 and 4, 2 and 6, are the component parts of 12; and 2, 3, and 4, are the component parts of 24.\n\n15. The product of a number multiplied into itself is called the square, or second power, of that number; and the number itself is in this case called the root. And if the square be multiplied into the root, the product is called the cube, or third power, of that number. And if the cube be multiplied into the root, the product thence arising is called the biquadrate, or fourth power, &c.\n\nCHAP. II: ADDITION.\n\nAddition is the collecting of two or more numbers into one sum or total.\n\nI. Addition of Integers:\n\nRule I. Set figures of like places under other, viz., units under units, tens under tens, &c.\n\nII. Beginning at the lowest place, set down the right-hand figures of the sum of every column, and carry the rest as to many units to the next superior place.\n\nExample I. Because similar or like things only can be added, place the numbers as directed in Rule I, viz., units under units, tens under tens, &c., as in the margin. Then beginning at the lowest place, viz., that of units; say, 4 units and 3 units make 7 units, which set below in the place of units; then 3 tens and 5 tens make 8 tens, which set below in the place of tens; then 2 hundreds and 4 hundreds make 6 hundreds, which set below in the place of...\nof hundreds, and you will find the sum or total to be 687.\n\n**Examp. II.** Having placed the numbers, units under units, &c., as in the margin, say 2 and 1 make 3, and 3 make 6, and 4 make 10; which being just 1 ten, and nothing over, set the right-hand figure 0 in the place of units; and because 1 ten in any lower place makes but one in the next superior place, carry 1 ten, as directed in Rule II. \u2014 saying, 1 ten, collected out of the units, and 6 tens, make 7 tens, and 4 make 11, and 0 makes but still 11, and 7 make 18; here again set down the right-hand figure 8, in the place of tens, and carry the remaining figure 1, being 1 hundred, to the next place, viz., that of hundreds; and having in like manner added up this column, the amount is 37; set down the right-hand figure 1 in the place of hundreds, and carry the remaining figure 3 to the next place or column; which being also added, amounts to 24; set the right-hand figure 4 below, in its proper place, and the remaining figure 2, which belongs to the next place, set on the left hand, there being no figure in the next place to which it can be carried. So the sum or total is 24180.\n\nII. Addition of the parts of integers, such as shillings, pence, farthings, ounces, &c.\n\n**Rule I.** Place like parts under other; viz., farthings under farthings, pence under pence, &c.\n\nII. Begin at the lowest of the parts, and carry according to the value of an unit of the next superior denomination; viz., for every four in the sum of farthings carry 1 to the pence, and for every twelve in the pence carry 1 to the shillings, &c.\n\nIII. If you carry at 20, 30, 40, 60, or any just number of tens, as in adding shillings, degrees, poles, minutes, seconds, &c., proceed with the column of units as in addition of integers, and from the sum of the column of tens carry 1 for every two, or 1 for every three, &c., according as 20 or two tens, thirty or three tens, &c., make an unit of the next superior denomination. The reason appears plain in the following operations.\n\n### Money\n\n#### Table\n\n| 4 farthings | 1 penny |\n|-------------|---------|\n| 12 pence    | 1 shilling |\n| 20 shillings | 1 pound |\n\nMarked thus.\n\n1. s. d. f. or q.\n\n1 = 20 = 240 = 960\n\n**Note,** The above mark signifies equal to.\n\n1. is put for libra, a pound; d. for denarius, a penny; and q. for quadrans, a fourth-part; but f is now the more usual mark for farthings.\n\nThat the learner may proceed in addition of money with the greater ease, it will be proper he get the following table by heart.\n\n### Money-Table\n\n| f. | d. | s. | l. |\n|----|----|----|---|\n| 4  | 1  | 20 | 1 |\n| 8  | 2  | 40 | 2 |\n| 12 | 3  | 60 | 3 |\n| 16 | 4  | 80 | 4 |\n| 20 | 5  | 100| 5 |\n| 24 | 6  | 120| 6 |\n| 28 | 7  | 140| 7 |\n| 32 | 8  | 160| 8 |\n| 36 | 9  | 180| 9 |\n| 40 | 10 | 200| 10 |\n\n**Examp.** Having, according to Rule I., placed like parts under other, viz., farthings under farthings, pence under pence, &c., and in each of these denominations, units under units, tens under tens, as in the margin, begin with the lowest of the parts, viz., the farthings; and say, 2 farthings and 1 farthing make 3 farthings, and 2 make 5, and 3 make 8; which, by the money-table, is 2 fours, or 2 pence, and nothing over; wherefore place 0 below in the place of farthings, or rather leave that place blank, and carry 2 pence to the place of pence, as directed in Rule II., saying, 2 pence, collected out of the farthings, and 9 make 11, and 8 make 19, and (passing the 0) make 20; to this sum of units add the tens. Thus, 20 and 1 ten make 30, and 1 ten more make 40 pence; which, by the money-table, is 3 twelves, or 3 shillings, and 4 pence over; these 4 pence set below in the place of pence, and carry 3 shillings to the place of shillings. Thus, 3 shillings, collected out of the pence, and 1 shilling make 4, and 7 make 11, and 9 make 20, and 8 make 28; and because in shillings we carry at a just number of tens, viz., at 20, set the right-hand figure 8 below in the place of units, as directed in Rule III., and carry the 2 tens to the place of tens. Thus 2 tens collected out of the units, and 1 ten make 3 tens, and 1 make 4, and 1 make 5 tens, or 2 twenties, and 1 ten over; and because 2 tens, or 1 twenty, make an unit in the next place, viz., that of pounds, set the 1 ten below in the place of tens, and carry the 2 twenty shillings, or 2 pounds, to the place of pounds; which, being integers, are added as taught in addition of integers.\n\nIt is usual to subjoin the farthings to the pence by way of fraction, as in the margin, where the former example is transcribed in this form for the learner's instruction; in which \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) denotes one farthing, \\( \\frac{2}{4} \\) two farthings, and \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) three farthings.\n\nIn adding up large accounts, some dot at 60 in the pence, and for every dot carry 5 to the shillings; and in adding the shillings they dot likewise at 60, and for every dot carry 3 to the pounds. Others choose to divide them...\nthem into parcels; then cast up each parcel separately, and afterwards add the sums of the several parcels into one total.\n\n2. AVOIRDUPOIS WEIGHT.\n\n| Table |\n|-------|\n| 16 drams | 1 ounce. |\n| 16 ounces | 1 pound. |\n| 28 pounds make | 1 quarter. |\n| 4 quarters | 1 hundred. |\n| 20 hundreds | 1 tun. |\n\nMarked thus.\n\n| T. | C. | Q. | lb. | oz. | dr. |\n|----|----|----|-----|-----|----|\n| 1  | =  | 20 | 80  | 2240 | 35840 | 573440 |\n| 1  | =  | 4  | 112 | 1792 | 28672 |\n\nBy Avordupois weight are weighed butter, cheese, rosin, wax, pitch, tar, tallow, soap, salt, hemp, flax, beef, brafs, iron, steel, tin, copper, lead, alum, and all grocery wares.\n\nNote, 10\u00bd C. of lead make a fodder.\n\nIn adding the following example, begin with the ounces, and say, 15 and 10 make 25; which being above 16, dot, and carry away the excess 9, saying, 9 of excesses and 6 make 15, and 8 make 23; where again dot, and carry away the excess 7, saying, 7 and 2 is 9, and 1 ten on the left is 19; where dot, and proceed with the excess 3, saying, 3 and 4 is 7, and 1 ten on the left is 17; where dot, and carry the excess 1, saying, 1 and 5 is 6, and 1 ten on the left is 16; where again dot, and there being no excess, you have nothing to set down.\n\n(10) (20) (4) (28) (16)\n\n| T. | C. | Q. | lb. | oz. |\n|----|----|----|-----|-----|\n| 74 | 19 | 3 | 27 | 15 |\n| 85 | 17 | 2 | 24 | 14 |\n| 68 | 13 | 1 | 20 | 12 |\n| 52 | 18 | 3 | 19 | 8 |\n| 30 | 10 | 2 | 18 | 6 |\n| 48 | 9 | 3 | 16 | 10 |\n| 97 | 5 | 1 | 3 | 15 |\n\n478 15 3 20\n\nProceed now to add the pounds; saying 5 carried from the ounces, viz. one for every dot, and 3 make 8, and 6 make 14, and 1 ten on the left is 24, and 8 make 32; which being above 28, dot, and go on, saying, 4 of excesses and 1 ten on the left is 14, and 9 is 23, and 1 ten on the left is 33; where again dot, and go on, saying, 5 of excesses and 20 is 25, and 4 is 29; where dot, and proceed, saying, 1 of excesses and 2 tens on the left make 21, and 7 make 28; where dot, and the 2 tens, or 20, on the left, set below.\n\nWe should now proceed to add the quarters; saying, 4 carried from the pounds and 1 make 5, &c.; but as you carry here 1 for every four, the quarters are added exactly as the farthings in addition of money. In the hundreds you carry at 20; which, therefore, are added as shillings: The tens are integers; and added accordingly.\n\nIII. Proof of Addition.\n\nAddition may be proved several ways.\n\n1. Merchants and men of business usually add each column first upwards, and then downwards, and, upon finding the sum to be the same both ways, they conclude the work to be right: and this is all the proof that their time, or the hurry of business, will admit of.\n\n2. It is a common practice in schools, to prove the work by a second summing without the top-line; and if thus sum added to the top-line makes the first total, the work is supposed to be right; as in the following example.\n\n| Top-line | 748 | 15 | 10\u00bd |\n|----------|-----|----|------|\n|          | 674 | 13 | 11\u00bd |\n|          | 835 | 17 | 9\u00bd  |\n|          | 90  | 18 | 8    |\n| Total    | 2350 | 6 | 3\u00bd  |\n| Total without the top-line | 1601 | 10 | 4\u00bd |\n| Proof    | 2350 | 6 | 3\u00bd |\n\nNote, This mark + signifies added to.\n\n3. Addition is also proved by casting out the 9's; for if the excess above the 9's in the total be the same as the excess in the items, the work may be presumed right. Thus, to prove the example in the margin, begin with the items, and say, 3 + 4 = 7, and 7 + 7 = 14 = 1 + 4 = 5; with this 5 pafs to the next item, and say, 5 + 6 = 11 = 1 + 1 = 2, and 2 + 8 = 10 = 1, and 1 + 4 = 5; which 5 being the excess of the items, place at the top of the cross, and proceed to cast the 9's out of the total, saying, 1 + 3 = 4; and 4 + 1 = 5; which 5, being the excess of the total, place at the foot of the cross; and because it is the same with the figure at the top, you conclude the work to be right.\n\nIf the items are of different denominations; as pounds, shillings, pence, &c.; you must begin with the highest denomination; and, after casting out the 9's, reduce the excess to the next inferior denomination; and then casting out the 9's, reduce the excess to the next inferior denomination; proceed in like manner with this, and all the other lower denominations, placing the last excess at the top of the cross; then, in the same manner, cast the 9's out of the total, placing the excess at the foot of the cross; and if the figure at the foot and top be the same, the work may be presumed right.\n\nIf any operation, whether in addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, be right, this kind of proof will always show it to be so; but if an operation be wrong, by a figure or figures being misplaced, or by miscounting 9's, or any just number of 9's, this kind of proof will not discover the mistake.\nCHAP. III. SUBTRACTION.\n\nSubtraction is the taking a lesser number from a greater, in order to discover their difference, or the remainder.\n\nI. Subtraction of Integers.\n\nRule I. Set figures of like place under other, viz. units under units, tens under tens, &c., and the greater of the given numbers uppermost.\n\nII. Beginning at the place of units, take the lower figures from those above, borrowing and paying ten, as need requires, and write the remainders below.\n\nExample I. Because similar or like things only can be subtracted, place the numbers as directed in Rule I, viz., units under units, tens under tens, &c., and the greatest uppermost, as in the margin.\n\nThen, beginning at the place of units, say, 2 units from 7 units, and 5 units remain; which set below in the place of units; then 6 tens from 6 tens, and nothing remains; wherefore set 0 below, in the place of tens; then 5 hundred from 8 hundred, and 3 hundred remain; which set below, in the place of hundreds; and you will find the total difference or remainder to be 305.\n\nII. Having placed the numbers, units under units, &c., as in the margin, say, 5 units from 2 units, you cannot, but, because an unit in the next superior place makes ten in this place, you must borrow 1, viz., 1 ten, from the said next place, as directed in Rule II.; which 1 ten being added to 2 makes 12; then say, 5 from 12, and 7 remains; which 7 set below in the place of units; then proceed, and pay the unit borrowed, either by effeeming 3, the next figure in the major, to be only 2, or, which is more usual, and the same in effect, by adding 1 to the next figure in the minor, thus, 1 that you borrowed and 8 make 9, from 3 you cannot, but, borrowing as before, you say, 9 from 13 and 4 remains; which 4 set below proceed, and say, 1 that you borrowed and 7 make 8, from 4 you cannot, but from 14, and 6 remains; which 6 set below: go on, and say, 1 borrowed and 2 make 3, from 7, and 4 remains; which 4 set below. So the difference or remainder is 4647.\n\nII. Subtraction of the parts of Integers; such as Shillings, Pence, Farthings, Ounces, &c.\n\nRule I. Place like parts under other, viz. farthings under farthings, pence under pence, &c., and the greater of the given numbers uppermost.\n\nII. Begin at the lowest of the parts, and borrow according to the value of an unit of the next superior denomination; viz. in farthings borrow 4, in pence borrow 12, &c., as the tables of money and weights direct.\n\nIII. If you borrow 20, 30, 40, 60, or any just number of tens, as in subtracting shillings, degrees, poles, minutes, seconds, &c., proceed with the right-hand column, as in subtraction of integers; and then subtract your tens, borrowing, if need be, the number of tens contained in an unit of the next superior denomination. The reason appears plain in the following operations.\n\n1. MONEY.\n\nHaving, according to (10) (20) (12) (4)\nRule I. placed like parts L. s. d. f.\nunder other, viz. farthings under farthings, 73 15 10 2 major.\npence under pence, &c., 48 12 6 2 minor.\nand in each of these denominations, units under units, tens under tens, and the greater of the given numbers uppermost, as in the margin, begin with the farthings, and say, 2 from 2, and 0 remains; and proceed to the pence, saying, 6 from 10 and 4 remains; which 4 set down, and go on to the shillings, saying 2 from 5 and 3 remains, and 1 from 1, and 0 remains; or you may say at once, 12 from 15, and 3 remains; which 3 being set down, proceed to the pounds, which are integers, and subtracted as such.\n\nIn this example say, 3 farthings from 1 farthing you cannot, but as directed in Rule II. you say, 3 from (10) (20) (12) 4, the number of farthings L. s. d. in 1 penny borrowed, and 708 14 6\u00bd major. 1 remains; which 1 added 170 17 10\u00bd minor. to 1 in the major gives 2 farthings for a remainder. 429 16 7\u00bd remainder.\n\nwhich set down, and proceed to the pence, saying, 1 penny borrowed and 10 make 11, which from 6 you cannot, but from 12, the number of pence in 1 shilling, and 1 remains; which r added to 6 in the major gives a remainder of 7; which set down, and go on to the shillings; and because in subtracting shillings we borrow a just number of tens, viz. 2 tens, or 20, work as directed in Rule III.; and in the right-hand column say, 1 borrowed and 7 make 8, which from 4 you cannot, but from 14, and 6 remains; which being set down, go on to the left-hand column, and say, 1 borrowed and 1 make 2, which from 1 you cannot, but from 2, the number of tens in 1 pound, and nothing remains, which 0 added to 1 in the major gives 1 for a remainder; which set down, and proceed to the pounds, saying, 1 borrowed and 8 make 9, which from 8 you cannot, but from 18, &c.\n\nNote. Some add the number borrowed to the figure or number in the major, and then subtract from their sum. Thus, in the farthings they add the 4 borrowed to 1 in the major, and then from the sum 5 they subtract the 3 in the minor; and in the pence they add the 12 borrowed to 6 in the major, and subtract from the sum 18, &c.; but the method taught above is the easiest and most usual.\n\n2. AVOIRDUPOIS WEIGHT.\n\nBegin with the pounds, and (10) (4) (28)\nsay, 24 from 22 you cannot, but L. s. d.\nfrom 28, the number of pounds in 84 1 22 major.\n1 quarter, and 4 remains, which 49 3 24 minor.\nadded to 22 in the major, gives 34 1 26 rem.\n26 for\nfor a remainder; which set below; and proceed to the quarters, saying, 1 quarter borrowed and 3 make 4, which from 1 you cannot, but from 4, the number of quarters in 1 C. and 0 remains, which 0 added to 1 in the major gives 1 for a remainder; which set down, and go on to the C. which are integers, saying, 1 C. borrowed and 9 make 10, which from 4 you cannot, but from 14, &c.\n\nIII. The Proof of Subtraction.\n\nMerchants and men of business use no other proof besides a revisal of the work, or running over it, a second time; but it is usual in schools to put the learner upon proving the operation, by some of the three methods following, viz.\n\n1. The work may be proved by addition; for if you add the remainder to the minor, the sum will be equal to the major, as in the following example.\n\n| Examp. | L. | s. | d. |\n|--------|----|----|----|\n| major  | 73 | 15 | 10 |\n| minor  | 48 | 12 | 6  |\n| rem.   | 25 | 3  | 4  |\n| proof  | 73 | 15 | 10 |\n\n2. By subtraction; for if you subtract the remainder from the major, the difference will be equal to the minor, as follows.\n\n|        | L. | s. | d. |\n|--------|----|----|----|\n| 5847   | major | 73 | 15 | 10 |\n| 2569   | minor | 48 | 12 | 6  |\n| 3278   | rem.   | 25 | 3  | 4  |\n| 2569   | proof  | 48 | 12 | 6  |\n\n3. By casting out the 9's; for the major being equal to the sum of the minor and remainder, if you cast the 9's out of the major, and place the excess at the top of the crofs, and then cast the 9's out of the minor and remainder, as if they were items in addition, and place the excess at the foot of the crofs, it is plain the figure at the top and foot, if the work be right, will be the same. Only, in proving subtraction of money, Avoidious weight, &c. care must be taken to begin with the highest denomination, reducing always the excess to the next inferior denomination, as taught in the proof of addition. See the following example.\n\n|        | L. | s. | d. |\n|--------|----|----|----|\n| major  | 73 | 15 | 10 |\n| minor  | 48 | 12 | 6  |\n| rem.   | 25 | 3  | 4  |\n\nChap. IV. Multiplication.\n\nIn multiplication there are two numbers given, viz. one to be multiplied, called the multiplicand; and another that multiplies it; called the multiplier; these two go under the common name of factors; and the number arising from the multiplication of the one by the other is called the product, and sometimes the fact, or the rectangle. If a multiplier consists of two or more figures, the numbers arising from the multiplication of these several figures into the multiplicand, are called particular, or partial products; and their sum is called the total product.\n\nMultiplication then is the taking or repeating of the multiplicand, as often as the multiplier contains unity. Or,\n\nMultiplication, from a multiplicand and a multiplier given, finds a third number, called the product, which contains the multiplicand as often as the multiplier contains unity.\n\nHence multiplication supplies the place of many additions; for if the multiplicand be repeated or set down as often as there are units in the multiplier, the sum of these, taken by addition, will be equal to the product by multiplication. Thus, $5 \\times 3 = 15 = 5 + 5 + 5$.\n\nThe first and lowest step in multiplication is, to multiply one digit by another; and the fact or number thence arising is called a single product. This elementary step may be learned from the following table, commonly called Pythagoras's table of multiplication: which is consulted thus; seek one of the digits or numbers on the head, and the other on the left side, and in the angle of meeting you have their product. The learner, before he proceed further, ought to get the table by heart.\n\nTo Pythagoras's table are here added, on account of their usefulness, the products of the numbers 10, 11, 12.\n\n### Table\n\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|\n| 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10| 12| 14| 16| 18| 20 | 22 | 24 |\n| 3 | 6 | 9 | 12| 15| 18| 21| 24| 27| 30 | 33 | 36 |\n| 4 | 8 | 12| 16| 20| 24| 28| 32| 36| 40 | 44 | 48 |\n| 5 | 10| 15| 20| 25| 30| 35| 40| 45| 50 | 55 | 60 |\n| 6 | 12| 18| 24| 30| 36| 42| 48| 54| 60 | 66 | 72 |\n| 7 | 14| 21| 28| 35| 42| 49| 56| 63| 70 | 77 | 84 |\n| 8 | 16| 24| 32| 40| 48| 56| 64| 72| 80 | 88 | 96 |\n| 9 | 18| 27| 36| 45| 54| 63| 72| 81| 90 | 99 | 108|\n|10 | 20| 30| 40| 50| 60| 70| 80| 90|100 |110 |120 |\n|11 | 22| 33| 44| 55| 66| 77| 88| 99|110 |121 |132 |\n|12 | 24| 36| 48| 60| 72| 84| 96|108|120 |132 |144 |\n\nI. Multiplication of Integers.\n\nRule I. Set the multiplier below the multiplicand, so as like places may stand under other, viz. units under units.\nunits, tens under tens, &c., but if either or both of the factors have ciphers on the right hand, set their first significant figures under other.\n\nThe order prescribed in this rule is not absolutely necessary, but very convenient as will appear in the examples.\n\nII. Beginning at the right hand, multiply each figure of the multiplier into the whole multiplicand, carrying as in addition, and placing the right-hand figure of each particular product directly under the multiplying figure.\n\nIII. Add the particular products, and their sum will be the total product.\n\n**Example I.** Having placed the multiplier under the multiplicand, as directed in Rule I. proceed to the operation, and say, 7 times 4 make 28; set the 8 below in the place of tens, and carry the 2 tens to the next place, as directed in Rule II. saying 7 times 9 make 63, and 2 that I carried make 65; set 5 below in the place of tens, and the 6, which belongs to the next place, set on its left hand, there being no further place to which it can be carried; so the product is 658.\n\nII. Here first multiply the right-hand figure 8 into the whole multiplicand, as in the former example; then proceed, and multiply likewise the 6 tens into the whole multiplicand, saying 6 times 2 make 12; set the 2 below under the multiplying figure, viz. in the place of tens, and carry the 1 to the next place, as directed in Rule II. The reason why the 2 is set under the multiplying figure, or in the place of tens, is, because the multiplying figure 6 is really 6 tens or 60, and 60 times 2 make 120; so that by carrying the 1 to the next place, and setting down 20, the 0 would fall into the place of units, and throw the 2 into the place of tens; but as 0 can make no alteration in the addition of the partial products, the setting of it down is safely and justly omitted.\n\nIII. When the multiplier has ciphers on the right hand, as it would be evidently lost labour to multiply by the ciphers, their only use being to throw figures on their left hand into higher places, set the first significant figures of the factors under other; and, after the operation is finished, annex the ciphers of the multiplier to the right hand of the product.\n\nIV. When the multiplier has ciphers intermixed with significant figures, omit the ciphers, because the multiplying by them would only produce so many lines of ciphers and so be labour in vain; wherefore multiply by the significant figures only; but take care to place the right-hand figure of each particular product directly under the multiplying figure.\n\n---\n\n**Contractions, and simple ways of working multiplication of integers.**\n\n1. To multiply any number by 10, by 100, by 1000, &c. to the given number annex one, two, three ciphers, &c. Thus, \\(23 \\times 10 = 230\\); and \\(384 \\times 100 = 38400\\); and \\(745 \\times 1000 = 745000\\).\n\n2. To multiply any number by 9, by 99, by 999, &c. multiply the given number first by 10, by 100, by 1000, &c. that is, annex one, two, three, &c. ciphers to it; from this subtract the given number, and the remainder is the product; as in the following examples.\n\n| Ex. 1 | Ex. 2 | Ex. 3 |\n|-------|-------|-------|\n| Mult. | Mult. | Mult. |\n| 47    | 627   | 999   |\n| by 9  | by 99 | by 999|\n| 470   | 62700 | 999000|\n| Sub.  | Sub.  | Sub.  |\n| 47    | 627   | 999   |\n| Prod. | Prod. | Prod. |\n| 423   | 62073 | 998001|\n\nFrom Ex. 3. we may learn, in general, that to multiply any number consisting entirely of 9's by itself, is to set 1 in the place of units, then as many ciphers, save one, as there are 9's in the given number; then 8, and on the left hand of 8 as many 9's as there are ciphers on its right.\n\n3. To multiply any number by 5; first multiply it by 10, that is, annex a cipher to it, and then halve it; and to multiply any number by 15, use the same method; and add both numbers together, as in the following examples:\n\nMultiply \\(7439\\)  \nby 5 \u2014 \\(74390\\)  \nMultiply \\(9856\\)  \nby 15 \u2014 \\(98560\\)  \nadd \\(49280\\)\n\nProduct \\(37195\\)  \nProduct \\(147840\\)\n\n4. To multiply any number by 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, &c. multiply by the unit's figure, and add the back-figure of the multiplicand to the product; and to multiply by 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, &c. add the double of the back-figure; and to multiply by 31, 32, 33, 34, &c. add the triple of it; and to multiply by 112, 113, 114, &c. add the two back-figures; and to multiply by 101, 102, 103, 104, &c. add the next back-figure save one; as in the following examples.\n\n| Ex. 1 | Ex. 2 |\n|-------|-------|\n| 876   | 876   |\n| or multiply by 11 thus | 876   |\n| 876   | 876   |\n| 9636  | 9636  |\n\n| Ex. 3 | Ex. 4 |\n|-------|-------|\n| 435   | 241   |\n| 27    | 34    |\n\n| Ex. 5 | Ex. 6 | Ex. 7 |\n|-------|-------|-------|\n| 7234  | 7234  | 7234  |\n| 112   | 7234  | 7234  |\n| 810208| 7234  | 31297 |\n|       | 810208| 76735 |\n\nIn\nIn multiplying by 12, as in Ex. 8. it is more usual, and equally easy, to proceed by saying, twelve times 8 make 96, and, setting down the 6, say, twelve times 4 is 48, and 9 carried is 576.\n\n5. If the multiplier consist of the same figure repeated, as 111, 222, 333, 777, &c., multiply by the unit's figure, and out of that product make up the total product, thus. Begin at the right hand, and first take one figure, then the sum of two, then the sum of three, &c. repeating the operation still from the right hand, as often as there are figures in the multiplier; then neglecting the right-hand figure, or figure in the first place, take the sum of as many figures toward the left hand as the multiplier has places; and if there be not so many, take the sum of all the figures there are; then, neglecting the figures in the first and second place, begin at the figure in the third place, proceed as before; and thus go on till the last or left-hand figure is taken in alone; as in the following examples.\n\nEx. 1. Ex. 2. Ex. 3.\n7645 4983 38\n33 666 4444\n22935 pr. by 3. 29898 pr. by 6. 152 pr. by 4.\n25228 total. 3318678 total. 168872 total.\n\n6. The operation may frequently be rendered shorter or easier, either by addition, subtraction, or a more simple multiplication; and the cases of this kind are so numerous and various, that they admit of no limitation. Consult the following examples and directions.\n\nEx. 1. Ex. 2. Ex. 3.\n438 374 746\n87 56 84\n3066 2244 2984\n3504 1870 5968\n38106 20944 62664\n\nWork the above examples as follows.\n\nEx. 1. Multiply by 7, and add that product to the multiplicand, instead of multiplying by 8.\n\nEx. 2. Multiply by 6, and out of that product subtract the multiplicand, instead of multiplying by 5.\n\nEx. 3. Multiply by 4, and double that product for 8.\n\nII. Multiplication of the parts of Integers.\n\nHere there are three cases.\n\n1. If your multiplier is a single digit, set it under the units figure of the lowest denomination, multiply it into all the parts of the multiplicand, beginning at the lowest, and carrying always as in addition, or according to the value of the next superior place.\n\nExamp. What is the price of 7 packs of cloth at L. 64, 8 s. 10\u00bd d. per pack?\n\nL. s. d. Here say, 7 times 2 is 14, which is 64 8 10\u00bd 3 pence and 2 farthings over; set down 7 the 2 farthings, and carry 3 to the place of pence, saying, 7 times 10 is 70, and 451 2 1\u00bd 3 that I carried makes 73, which is 6 shillings and 1 penny; let down the 1 penny, and carry 6 to the place of shillings, saying, 7 times 8 is 56, and 6 that I carried is 62, which makes 3 pounds and 2 shillings; set down the 2 shillings, and carry 3 to the place of pounds which are integers.\n\n2. If your multiplier consists of two or more figures, multiply continually by its component parts, or by the component parts of the composite number that comes nearest to it, and then multiply the given multiplicand by the difference of the multiplier, and the nearest composite number: the sum or difference of these two products is the answer.\n\nExamp. I. What is the price of 56 C. tobacco, at L. 2 14\u00bd 9\u00bd per C.\n\nHere the component parts are 8 and 7; for 8 \u00d7 7 = 56; therefore,\n\nMultiply first by 8, and that product by 7; or, which will give the same answer, multiply first by 7, and then that product by 8.\n\n| L. | s. | d. |\n|----|----|----|\n| 2  | 14 | 9\u00bd |\n|    |    | 8   |\n\n21 18 6\n\nExamp. II. What is the price of 126 yards of velvet, at L. 3 : 8 : 4 per yard?\n\nHere multiply first by 6, that product by 7, and that product again by 3; but as the component parts are various, and may be chosen at pleasure, you would have had the same answer, had you multiplied by 9 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 2; or by 7 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2.\n\n| L. | s. | d. |\n|----|----|----|\n| 3  | 8  | 4   |\n|    |    | 6   |\n\n143 10\n\nFrom the above example may be deduced a general and easy rule for working all questions of this kind; and is of excellent use when the multiplier happens to be a number; viz.\n\nMultiply continually so many times by 10 as there are figures in the multiplier, save one; then multiply the given price by the right-hand figure of the multiplier; and again, the first product of 10 by the following figure of the multiplier; and so on, till you have multiplied by all the figures in the multiplier. The sum of these products is the answer.\n\nExamp. III. What is the price of 8604 yards of cloth, at 19 s. 6\u00bd d. per yard?\n\n| L. | s. | d. | Price of |\n|----|----|----|---------|\n| 19 | 6\u00bd|     |         |\n|    |    | 10  | 1 yd, \u00d7 4 = 3 18 2 4 yds. |\n\n9 15 5 10 yds, \u00d7 0 =\n\n97 14 2 100 yds, \u00d7 6 = 586 5 600 yds.\n\n977 1 8 1000 yds, \u00d7 8 = 7816 13 4 8000 yds.\n\nPrice of 8604 yards, 8406 16 6\n3. If your multiplier consists of integers and parts, the operation is performed by a cross multiplication of the several parts of the multiplier into all the parts of the multiplicand.\n\nThe contents of mason and joiners work are frequently cast up by this kind of multiplication; for understanding of which observe, that\n\nThe superficial content of any rectangle is found by multiplying the length into the breadth; and the content of a right-angled triangle is found by multiplying the base into half the perpendicular or height.\n\nThe dimensions are usually taken in lineal feet, inches, and lines; and the operation is performed by the following rules.\n\nI. Any lineal measure multiplied into the same lineal measure produces squares of that name. Thus, lineal feet multiplied into lineal feet produce square feet; lineal inches into lineal inches produce square inches, &c.\n\nII. Lineal feet into lineal inches produce rectangles 1 foot long and 1 inch broad, which divided by 12 quote square feet; and the remainder multiplied by 12, produces square inches.\n\nIII. Lineal feet into lineal lines produce rectangles 1 foot long and 1 line broad, which divided by 144 quote square feet; and the remainders are rectangles equal to square inches.\n\nIV. Lineal inches into lineal lines produce small rectangles 1 inch long and 1 line broad, which divided by 12 quote square inches; and the remainder, multiplied by 12, produces square lines.\n\nExample I. In an area, pavement, or piece of plaster-work, in length 24 feet 7 inches, and in breadth 18 feet 5 inches, how many square feet?\n\n| F. | in. | li. |\n|----|-----|----|\n| 24 | 7   |    |\n| 18 | 5   |    |\n| 432| 35  |    |\n| 20 | 72  |    |\n| 452| 107 |    |\n\nHere multiply 18 lineal feet into 24 lineal feet, and the product is 432 square feet; then multiply 5 lineal inches into 7 lineal inches, and the product is 35 square inches, by Rule I.; then multiply 18 lineal feet into 7 lineal inches, and the product is 126; and again multiply 24 lineal feet into 5 lineal inches, and the product is 120; which added to the former product, gives 246 rectangles, each being 1 foot in length and one inch in breadth; these divided by 12 quote 20 square feet; and the remainder 6 multiplied by 12, produces 72 square inches, according to Rule II.; these add to the former square feet and inches, and you'll find the answer or total product to be 452 square feet, and 107 square inches.\n\nExample II. In an area or floor, in length 38 feet 9 inches 6 lines, and in breadth 23 feet 8 inches 6 lines, how many square feet?\n\n| F. | in. | li. |\n|----|-----|----|\n| 38 | 9   |    |\n| 23 | 8   |    |\n| 874| 72  |    |\n| 428| 84  |    |\n| 278| 8   |    |\n| 919| 98  |    |\n\nBecause the sum of the inches exceeds 144, carry 1 from them to the column of feet, and set down the overplus, viz. 98.\n\nThe operation may be rendered easier and shorter by previously reducing the factors to two denominations, viz. inches and lines. Thus the former example may be proposed and wrought as follows.\n\nIn an area or floor, in length 465 inches 6 lines, and in breadth 284 inches 6 lines, how many square inches and feet?\n\n| Inch. | lin. |\n|-------|------|\n| 465   | 6    |\n| 284   | 6    |\n| 132060| 36   |\n| 374   | 72   |\n| 132434| 108  |\n\nThe answer here is 132434 square inches, and 108 square lines; and if the inches be divided by 144, you will have 910 square feet and a remainder of 98 square inches, as before.\n\nOr the factors may be reduced to the lowest denomination, viz., lines, and then the product will be square lines, which, divided by 144, will quote square inches, and the remainder will be square lines; and the square inches, divided by 144, will quote square feet, and the remainder will be square inches. Again, the square feet, divided by 9, will quote square yards, and the remainder will be square feet; and the square yards, divided by 36, will quote square rods, and the remainder will be square yards.\n\nIf this cross multiplication be extended to the mensuration of solids, the content of which is found by multiplying the superficial content of the base into the height, depth, length, or thickness, the operation must be conducted by the following rules.\n\nV. Any superficial measure multiplied into the same lineal measure produces a solid of the same name. Thus superficial feet multiplied into lineal feet produce solid feet; superficial inches multiplied into lineal inches produce solid inches, &c.\nVI. Superficial feet into lineal inches produce parallelopipeds, whose base is 1 square foot, and their height 1 inch; which divided by 12 quote solid feet; and the remainder multiplied by 144, produces solid inches.\n\nVII. Superficial feet into lineal lines produce parallelopipeds, whose base is 1 square foot, and their height 1 line; which divided by 144 quote solid feet; and the remainder multiplied by 12 produces solid inches.\n\nVIII. Superficial inches into lineal lines produce parallelopipeds, whose base is 1 square inch, and their height 1 line; which divided by 12 quote solid inches; and the remainder multiplied by 12 produces solid inches.\n\nIX. Lineal feet into superficial inches produce parallelopipeds, whose base is 1 square inch, and their height 1 foot; which divided by 144 quote solid feet; and the remainder multiplied by 12 produces solid lines.\n\nX. Lineal feet into superficial lines produce parallelopipeds, whose base is 1 square line, and their height 1 foot; which divided by 12 quote solid inches; and the remainder multiplied by 144 produces solid lines.\n\nXI. Lineal inches into superficial lines produce parallelopipeds, whose base is 1 square line, and their height 1 inch; which divided by 144 quote solid inches; and the remainder multiplied by 12 produces solid lines.\n\nExample III. In a piece of timber, whose length is 18 feet 6 inches, breadth 2 feet 4 inches, and thickness 2 feet 3 inches, how many solid feet?\n\nHere first multiply 18 feet 6 inches into 2 feet 4 inches, as formerly, and the product is 43 feet 24 inches superficial; which next multiply into 2 feet 3 inches lineal, thus, 43 superficial feet into 2 lineal feet produce 86 solid feet, and 24 superficial inches into 3 lineal inches produce 72 solid inches, by Rule V.; then 43 superficial feet into 3 lineal inches produce 129 parallelopipeds, whose base is 1 square foot, and their height 1 inch; which divided by 12 quotes 10 solid feet; and the remainder 9 multiplied into 144 produces 1296 solid inches, by Rule VI. Again, 2 lineal feet into 24 superficial inches produce 48; which, being less than 144, you esteem a remainder, and multiplying it into 12 you have a product of 576 solid inches, by Rule IX.\n\nBecause the sum of the inches exceeds 1728, carry 1 from thence to the feet, and the overplus 216 set down.\n\nExample IV. How many solid feet in a polished stone, that is 8 feet 9 inches 5 lines long, 7 feet 3 inches broad, and 3 feet 5 lines thick?\n\n| F. | in. | l. |\n|----|-----|---|\n| 8  | 9   | 5 |\n| 7  | 3   | 1287(7 F.) |\n| 56 | 27  | 12x3=36 in. |\n| 7  | 36  | 7x5=35 in. by Rule III. |\n| 35 |     | 3x5=15 |\n|    | 36  | 12x15(1 in. by Rule IV. |\n| 63 | 95  | 36 sup. 12x3=36 li. |\n|    | 5 lin. |\n\n63x5=315, and 144x315(2 F.) by R.VII.\n12x27=324 in.\n3x99=297, and 144x297(2 F.) by R.IX.\n12x9=108 in.\n3x36=108, and 12x108(9 in. by Rule X.\n5x99=495, and 12x495(41 in.) by R.VIII.\n144x3=432 lines. by R.X.\n\nThe operation may be facilitated by previously reducing the three factors to two denominations, viz. inches and lines, as was done in Example II. on superficial measure.\n\nOr the three factors may be reduced to the lowest denomination, viz. lines, which being multiplied continually, will produce solid lines, which divided by 1728, will quote solid inches, the remainder being solid lines; and the solid inches divided by 1728 will quote solid feet, the remainder being solid inches; and the solid feet divided by 27 will quote solid yards, the remainder being solid feet; and the solid yards divided by 216 will quote solid roods; the remainder being solid yards.\n\nWe shall only further observe, that as the rules for working questions by cros multiplication are numerous, and the operation tedious, it is easier to convert the parts into a decimal fraction of their integer, and then work as taught in the multiplication of decimals.\n\nIII. The Proof of Multiplication.\n\nMultiplication may be proved several ways, viz. by multiplication, by division, and by casting out the 9's.\n\n1. By multiplication: Change the places of the factors, and make that the multiplier which before was the multiplicand; and if the work be right, you will have the same product as before; but this method is tedious.\n\n2. By division: When the work is right, the product divided by the multiplier quotes the multiplicand; or, divided by the multiplicand, quotes the multiplier. But this supposes the learner acquainted with division.\n\n3. The most usual method therefore of proving multiplication is by casting out the 9's; which is done thus: Cast the 9's out of the multiplicand and multiplier, and place the excesses on the right and left sides of a cros; multiply these two figures into one another, casting the 9's out of their product, if need be, and place the excess at the top of the cros; then casting the 9's also out of the product of your multiplication, place its excess at the bottom;\nbottom; and if the work be right, the figures at top and bottom will agree, or be the same.\n\n**Examp. I.** Here cast the 9's out of the multiplicand, and place the excesses 7 on the right side of the cross; then cast the 9's out of the multiplier, and place the excesses 2 on the left side of the cross; next multiply these excesses 2 and 7 into one another, cast the 9's out of their product, and place the excesses five at the top of the cross; lastly, cast the 9's out of the product, and place the excess 5 at the foot of the cross; which being the same with the figure at the top, you may conclude the work to be right.\n\n**Examp. II.** Here, in casting the 9's out of the multiplicand, and out of the product, begin with the pounds, and reduce the excess to shillings, and in like manner the excess of the shillings is reduced to pence, and that of the pence to farthings. The multiplier being an abstract number, needs no reduction; but if a multiplier be a mixt number, or consist of integers and parts, as feet and inches, &c., the excess of the higher denomination must always be reduced to the lower.\n\n---\n\n**Chap. V. Division.**\n\nDivision discovers how often one number is contained in another: or,\n\nDivision, from two numbers given, finds a third, which contains unity as often as the one given number contains the other.\n\nThe number to be divided, or which contains the other, is called the dividend; the number by which we divide, or which is contained in the dividend, is called the divisor; and the number found by division, or which expresses how often the dividend contains the divisor, is called the quotient or quot.\n\nAs multiplication supplies the place of many additions, so division, which is the reverse of multiplication, serves instead of many subtractions; as will thus appear: Suppose it were required to divide 18 by 6, that is, to find how often 6 is contained in 18, the work by subtraction will stand as in the margin: by which it appears, that 6 is contained 3 times in the number 18. But this, by division, may be found at one trial: thus,\n\nSet the divisor on the left of the dividend, leaving room on the right hand for the quotient, as in the margin; and then say, How often 6 in 18?\n\n**Ans.** 3 times: this 3 set in the quotient; then multiply the quotient figure 3 into the divisor 6, saying, 3 times 6 make 18; which set down below the dividend, and subtract it from the dividend, and 0 remains.\n\n---\n\n**I. Division of Integers.**\n\n**Rule I.** From the left-hand part of the dividend point off the first dividual, viz. so many figures as will contain the divisor.\n\n**II.** Ask how often the divisor is contained in the dividual, and put the answer in the quotient.\n\n**III.** Multiply the divisor by the figure set in the quotient, and subtract the product from the dividual.\n\n**IV.** To the right of the remainder bring down the next figure of the dividend for a new dividual; and then proceed as before.\n\n**Examp. I.** Here, because the divisor 7 is contained in 8, the left-hand figure of the dividend, point it off as the first dividual, according to Rule I.; and then say, How often 7 in 8? **Ans.** 1 time; which 1 set in the quotient, as directed in Rule II.; then multiply the divisor 7 by this quotient figure 1, and subtract the product 7 from the dividual 8, as directed in Rule III.; to the remainder 1 bring down the following figure of the dividend, for the second dividual, as directed in Rule IV.; then proceed as before, and say, How often 7 in 17? **Ans.** 2 times; wherefore, setting two in the quotient, multiply and subtract and find the next remainder to be 3; to which bring down the following figure of the dividend, and you have 35 for the third dividual; then say, How often 7 in 35? **Ans.** 5 times; which 5 being placed in the quotient, multiply and subtract, and 0 remains; so the quotient is 125.\n\nBy reviewing the steps of the preceding operation, and reducing the dividuals and quotient-figures to their separate values, the reason of the rules will be obvious; for,\n\nThe separate value of the first dividual 8 is 800; and the separate value of 1, the first figure put in the quotient, is 100; for as 8 contains 7 the divisor 1 time, so 800 contains it 100 times, 2d dividual 170 and 100 remains; to which bring down the following figure of the dividend 7, whose separate value is 70; and the second dividual is 170; and as 7 is contained 2 times in 17, so it is contained 20 times in 170, and 30 remains; to which bring down the next or last figure of the dividend 5; and the third dividual is...\nis 35, in which the divisor 7 is contained 5 times. Now it is evident, that the sum of the partial quotients, 125, is the total quotient, or a number expressing how often the dividend 875 contains the divisor 7.\n\nFrom the above example we may learn, that there are always just so many figures in the quotient as there are dividuals; or the first dividual, with the number of subsequent figures in the dividend, is equal to the number of places or figures in the quotient.\n\nHence likewise may be inferred, that no divisor is contained in any dividual oftener than 9 times; for the dividual, excluding the right-hand figure, is always less than the divisor by 1 at least; and if both be multiplied by 10, or have a cipher annexed to each of them, the product of the dividual will be less than the product of the divisor by 10 at least; but no right-hand figure can supply this defect of 10; therefore the divisor is not contained 10 times in any dividual, and consequently not oftener than 9 times.\n\nHere too observe, that the right-hand figure of the first dividual, and all the subsequent figures of the dividend, have a point or dot set below them, as they are brought down; which is done to prevent mistakes, by distinguishing them, in this manner, from the figures not yet brought down.\n\nExamp. II.

Ans. 4; which put in the quotient: Then multiply and subtract; and as nothing remains, bring down the next figure of the dividend 8, and say, How often 8 in 8? Ans. 1; which put in the quotient: then multiply and subtract; and as nothing remains, bring down the last figure of the dividend 7, and say, How often 8 in 7? Ans. 2; which put in the quotient: then multiply and subtract, and 1 remains.\n\nTo complete the quotient, draw a line on the right side, and bring the remainder above the line, and the divisor 8 below it, signifying that 1 remains to be divided by 8; or this part of the quotient may be considered as a fraction, whose numerator is 1, and its denominator 8; and the quotient thus completed shews, that the dividend contains the divisor 7004112 times, and one eighth part of a time.\n\nHere observe, that not only the last remainder, but every other remainder, must be less than the divisor; for if it be either greater or equal, the divisor might have been oftener got, and the quotient-figure is too little. And should any one in this case attempt to continue the operation, the quotient-figures would be all 9's, the dividuals would prove inexhaustible, and the remainders would constantly increase.\n\nHence also learn, that if any dividual happen to be less than the divisor, you must put 0 in the quotient, and bring down the next figure of the dividend; and if it be still less than the divisor, you must put another 0 in the quotient, and bring down the following figure of the dividend, &c.\n\nIII. Here the divisor consists of two figures; and because it is contained in the two left-hand figures of the dividend 78, point them off as the first dividual; and say, How often 3 in 7? Ans. 2, and 1 remains; which I placed, or conceived as placed, on the left hand of the following figure 8, makes 18: then say, Can I have the following figure of the divisor 6 also 2 times in 18? Ans. Yes; consequently I get 36 the divisor 2 times in 78 the dividual; wherefore put 2 in the quotient, and multiply that 2 into the divisor 36, and subtract the product 72 from the dividual 78; and to the remainder 6 bring down the following figure of the dividend 9, for a new dividual: then say, How often 3 in 6? Ans. 2, and 0 remains; again you say, Can I have 6 also 2 times in 9? Ans. No; therefore you can have 36 in 69 only 1 time, which 1 you put in the quotient: then multiply and subtract as before; and to the remainder 33 bring down the next figure 4 for a new dividual: Then, because the dividual consists of a figure more than the divisor, say, How often the first figure of the divisor 3 in the first two figures of the dividual 33? Ans. 9, and 6 remains; which 6 placed on the left hand of the following figure 4 makes 64: Again, say, Can I have 6 also 9 times in 64? Ans. Yes; consequently 36 can be had 9 times in 334; wherefore you put 9 in the quotient: Then multiply and subtract; and to the remainder 10 bring down the next figure 2 for a new dividual: Here likewise, because the dividual has a figure more than the divisor, say, How often 3 in 10? Ans. 3, and 1 remains; which 1 placed on the left hand of the following figure 2 makes 12: Again say, Can I have 6 also 3 times in 12? Ans. No; consequently 36 cannot be had 3 times in 102; wherefore try if\nyou can have it 2 times; saying, 2 times 3 is 6 from 10, and 4 remains; which 4 placed on the left hand of the next figure 2 makes 42: And again say, Can I have 6 also 2 times in 42? Ans. Yes; consequently 36 can be had 2 times in 102; accordingly put 2 in the quotient, multiply and subtract; and to the remainder 30 bring down the next and last figure of the dividend 6, for a new dividual: Then, because the dividual has a figure more than the divisor, say, How often 3 in 30? Ans. 9, and 3 remains; which 3 placed on the left hand of the following figure 6 make 36: And again say, Can I have 6 also 9 times in 36? Ans. No; consequently 36 cannot be had 9 times in 306; therefore try if it can be had 8 times, saying, 8 times 3 is 24 from 30, and 6 remains; which 6 placed on the left hand of the following figure 6 makes 66: Again say, Can I have 6 also 8 times in 66? Ans. Yes; consequently 36 can be had 8 times in 306; wherefore put 8 in the quotient, and multiply and subtract as before: The last remainder 18 is the numerator of a fraction, and the divisor its denominator, to be annexed to the integral part of the quotient; as was taught in the former example.\n\nThe preceding operation points out the manner of procedure when the divisor consists of more figures than one, viz., you must take the first figure of the divisor out of the first figure of the dividual, or out of the first two figures of the dividual in case the dividual have a figure more than the divisor: Then imagine the remainder to be prefixed to the next figure of the dividual, and try if you can have the second figure of the divisor as often out of this number; if you can, imagine again the remainder to be prefixed to the following figure of the dividual, and try if you can have the third figure of the divisor as often out of this number, &c.; but if you find you cannot have some subsequent figure of the divisor so often as you took the first, you must go back, and take the first figure of the divisor 1 time less, or some number of times less out of the first, or out of the first two figures of the dividual: Then proceed as before, repeating the trial till you find you have the second and all the subsequent figures of the divisor as often as you took the first.\n\nBut here observe, that if, in trying how often the divisor can be had in the dividual, either 9, or a number greater than 9, any where remain, you may conclude, without further trial, that all the subsequent figures of the divisor can be had as often as you took the first; as may be thus demonstrated.\n\nSuppose the subsequent figures of the divisor to be the highest possible, that is, all 9's, and the following figures of the dividual the lowest possible, that is, all 0's; again, imagine the remainder 9 prefixed to the following figure of the dividual 0, that it will make 90; now it is plain, that the subsequent figure of the divisor 9 can be had in 90, the highest number of times possible, viz., 9 times, and 9 will remain; which prefixed to the next figure of the dividual 0, makes 90, in which the subsequent figure of the divisor 9 can again be had 9 times, and 9 will remain as before; therefore all the subsequent figures of the divisor can be had as often as you took the first; and if they can be had in this case, much more can they be had when a number greater than 9 remains.\n\nIV If, as in the margin, a cipher or ciphers, possess the right hand of the divisor, cut them off, and cut off as many figures, viz., in this example, the figure 2 from the right hand of the dividend; then divide the remaining figures of the dividend, viz., 89678, by the remaining figures of the divisor, viz., 648, and you have the integral part of the quotient; but to the remainder 254 annex the figure cut off from the dividend, and you have 2542 for the numerator of your fraction, and the whole divisor 6480 is the denominator.\n\nThe reason will appear obvious by working a question in this manner, and also at full length, without cutting off the cipher or ciphers, and then comparing the two operations.\n\nV If, as in the margin, the figures cut off from the right hand of the dividend, happen to be all ciphers; in this case, the last remainder, without regarding the ciphers cut off, is the numerator of your fraction, and the significant figures of the divisor the denominator. The reason is assigned in the doctrine of fractions.\n\nIn like manner, if there be cut off from the dividend any number of significant figures, with a cipher or ciphers on their right hand; in this case the last remainder, with the significant figures cut off, make the numerator of your fraction; and the significant figures of the divisor, with as many ciphers as the number of significant figures cut off from the dividend, make the denominator. Thus, if, in the above example, the figures cut off from the dividend had been 50, the numerator of your fraction would have been 365, and the denominator 480.\n\nContractions in working Division of Integers.\n\n1. To divide any number by 10, 100, 1000, &c. you have only to point off for a remainder as many figures on the right hand of the dividend as the divisor has ciphers, and the other figures on the left of the point or separatrix are the quotient. Thus, 7489634 divided by 10, 100, 1000, &c. stands as follows:\n\n| Quot rem. |\n|-----------|\n| 10 | 748963.4 |\n| 100 | 74896.34 |\n| 1000 | 7489.634 |\n| 10000 | 748.9634 |\n\n2. If the figures of the divisor are all 9's, or all except the units figure, as 9, 99, 999, 98, 997, 9996, &c. work as follows:\n\nFind a new divisor, by annexing to unity as many ciphers as there are figures in the given divisor, subtract the given from the new divisor, and the remainder or difference is the complement. Divide the given dividend by the new divisor, viz. point off so many figures on the\nthe right hand as there are ciphers in the said divisor; the figures thus pointed off are to be esteemed a remainder, and the other figures on the left hand are to be accounted a quotient; then multiply this quotient by the complement, placing the units of the product under the units of the former remainder; again, divide this product by the new divisor, by pointing off from the right hand the same number of figures as in the former remainder, and the figures to the left are to be esteemed another quotient; which quotient you are again to multiply by the complement, and divide as before. And in this manner proceed till the last quotient is nothing; then add as in addition of integers, observing the carriage from the left hand column of the remainders; to the remainders add the product of the said carriage and complement, and the sum is the total remainder; and the sum of the several quotients is the total quotient required.\n\n**Example.**\n\nDivide 74678 by 98.\n\nNew divisor 100\n\nGiven divisor 98\n\nComplement 2\n\nCarriage 2\u00d72 complement = 4\n\n**Explanation.**\n\nFirst, to unity annex two ciphers, because the given divisor consists of two figures, and so the new divisor is 100; from which subtract the given divisor 98, and there remains 2 for the complement.\n\nNext divide the given dividend by the new divisor, viz., point off 98, the two figures next the right hand, for the first remainder; and the figures on the left, namely, 746, is the quotient.\n\nThen multiply the said first quotient 746 by the complement 2; and by the new divisor divide the product 1492, viz., point off 92 for the second remainder, and 14 is the second quotient.\n\nAgain, multiply the second quotient 14 by the complement 2, and the product 28, divided by 100, gives 28 for the third remainder, but nothing to the quotient.\n\nThen add the several remainders and quotients, and find the total quotient amounts to 762, and the remainders to 18.\n\nLastly, multiply 2, the carriage from the left-hand-column of the remainders, by the complement 2; and the product 4 add to the remainders 18, and the sum 22 is the total remainder.\n\n**II. Division of the parts of Integers.**\n\nHere there are three cases.\n\n1. If the divisor be a digit, by it divide the integers of the dividend, reduce the remainder to the parts of the next inferior denomination, and add it, when thus reduced, to the quotients; then divide the sum, reducing and adding the remainder to the parts of the following denomination, &c.\n\nNote. If the integral part of the dividend be less than the divisor, you must, in the first place, reduce it to the parts of the next denomination.\n\n**Example. I.** If L. 274 : 13 : 8 : 3 be equally divided among 8 men, what will each man's share be?\n\nHere first divide the integers L. 274 by 8, and the quotient is L. 34, and L. 2 8)274 13 8 3 dividend, remains; which reduced to the next denomination makes 40 shillings; and these added to 13 shillings make 53 shillings; which divided by 8 gives 6 shillings to the quotient, and 5 shillings remains; which 5 shillings reduced make 60d. and 60d. added to 8d. make 68 d.; which divided by 8 gives 8 d., to the quotient, and 4 d. remains, &c.\n\nThe operation may, if you please, be drawn out at large; as in the following.\n\n**Example. II.** If C. 42 : 2 : 8 of tobacco be made up into 5 equal hds., what will be the neat weight of each hhd?\n\nHere divide the C. 43 by 5, and the quotient is C. 8, and C. 3 remains; which reduced, and added to the 2 Q. makes 14 Q. which divide by 5, &c.\n\n**III. The Proof of Division.**\n\nDivision may be proved several ways. viz., by multiplication, by division, and by casting out the 9's.\n\n1. By multiplication: Multiply the quotient by the divisor, or the divisor by the quotient; and the product with the remainder added to it, will be equal to the dividend: Or, take the products of the quotient-figures into the divisor, add them in the order they stand under the individuals; and their sum, with the remainder, will be equal to the dividend.\n\n2. By division: Divide the difference of the dividend and remainder by the quotient, and your next quotient will be equal to your first divisor, without any remainder. But this method is tedious.\n\n3. By casting out the 9's: Cast the 9's out of the divisor.\nvisor and quotient, place the excesses on the right and left sides of a cross; then multiply these two figures into one another, and cast the 9's out of their product; add the excess to the remainder; and, casting out the 9's if need be, place the sum or excess at the top of the cross; then cast the 9's out of the dividend, and set the excess at the bottom. If the work be right, the figures at the top and bottom of the cross will agree, or be the same.\n\nThese methods of proof are a proper exercise to the learner in schools; but, in business, the only proof used is a careful revisal of the operation.\n\n**Chap. VI. Reduction.**\n\nReduction teacheth how to bring a number of one name or denomination to another of the same value; and is either descending, ascending, or mixt.\n\nI. Reduction descending brings a number of a higher denomination to a lower, when the lower is some aliquot part of the higher; as pounds to shillings, pence, or farthings; and is performed by multiplication.\n\nII. Reduction ascending brings a number of a lower denomination to a higher, when the lower is some aliquot part of the higher; as shillings, pence, or farthings, to pounds; and is performed by division.\n\nIII. Mixt reduction brings a number of one denomination to another, when the one is no aliquot part of the other; as pounds to guineas, and requires the use of both multiplication and division.\n\nIn treating of reduction we shall conjoin the descending and ascending, the one serving as a proof of the other; and shall afterwards treat of mixt reduction by itself.\n\nIn working reduction, of whatever kind, the following rule is to be observed, viz.\n\nMultiply or divide as the tables of money and weights direct.\n\n**Reduction descending and ascending.**\n\n1. **Money.**\n\n**Quest. 1.** In L. 472 how many shillings, pence, and farthings?\n\nThis reduction is descending, therefore multiply the pounds by 20, because 20 shillings make 1 pound, and the product is shillings; then multiply the shillings by 12, because 12 pence make 1 shilling, and the product is pence: lastly, multiply the pence by 4, because 4 farthings make 1 penny, and the product is farthings.\n\n|        |        |\n|--------|--------|\n| 472    |        |\n| 20     |        |\n| 9440   |        |\n| 12     |        |\n| 1888   |        |\n| 944    |        |\n| 113280 |        |\n| 4      |        |\n| 453120 |        |\n\n**Proof by Reduction ascending.**\n\nIn 453120 farthings how many pence, shillings, and pounds?\n\nHere divide the farthings by 4, because 4 farthings make 1 penny, and the quotient is pence: then divide the pence by 12, because 12 pence make 1 shilling, and the quotient is shillings: lastly, divide the shillings by 20, because 20 shillings make 1 pound, and the quotient is pounds.\n\nNote 1. To reduce pounds to pence at one operation, multiply by 240, the number of pence in 1 pound.\n\nNote 2. To reduce pounds to farthings at one operation, multiply by 960, the number of farthings in 1 pound.\n\nNote 3. To reduce shillings to farthings at one operation, multiply by 48, the number of farthings in 1 shilling.\n\nNote 4. To reduce pence to pounds at one operation, divide by 240, the pence in 1 pound.\n\nNote 5. To reduce farthings to pounds at one operation, divide by 960, the farthings in 1 pound.\n\nNote 6. To reduce farthings to shillings at one operation, divide by 48, the farthings in 1 shilling.\n\nHere follows the farthings of Quest. 1. reduced back to pounds by these notes.\n\nBy note 4.\n\n|        |        |\n|--------|--------|\n| 4)453120 |        |\n| 240)113280 |        |\n| 96     |        |\n| 172    |        |\n| 168    |        |\n| 48     |        |\n| 48     |        |\n| (o)    |        |\n\nBy note 5.\n\n|        |        |\n|--------|--------|\n| 96)453120 |        |\n| 384    |        |\n| 691    |        |\n| 672    |        |\n| 192    |        |\n| 192    |        |\n| (o)    |        |\n\nBy note 6.\n\n|        |        |\n|--------|--------|\n| 48)453120 |        |\n| 944    |        |\n| 432    |        |\n| 211    |        |\n| 192    |        |\n| 192    |        |\n| (o)    |        |\n\n2. **Avoir.**\n2.

VII. The Rule of Three.**\n\nThe Rule of Three, called also, on account of its excellence, the Golden Rule, from certain numbers given finds another; and is divided into simple and compound, or into single and double.\n\n**Sect. I. The Simple or Single Rule of Three.**\n\nThe simple rule of three, from three numbers given, finds a fourth, to which the third bears the same proportion as the first does to the second.\n\nThe nature and properties of proportional numbers may be understood sufficiently for our purpose from the following observations.\n\nIn comparing any two numbers, with respect to the proportion which the one bears to the other, the first number, or that which bears proportion, is called the antecedent; and the other, to which it bears proportion, is called the consequent; and the quantity of the proportion or ratio is estimated from the quot arising from dividing the antecedent by the consequent. Thus the ratio or proportion betwixt 6 and 3 is the quot arising from dividing the antecedent 6 by the consequent 3; namely, 2; and the ratio or proportion betwixt 1 and 2 is the quot arising from the division of the antecedent 1 by the consequent 2; namely \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), or one half.\n\nFour numbers are said to be proportional when the ratio of the first to the second is the same as that of the third to the fourth; and the proportional numbers are usually distinguished from one another as in the following examples.\n\n\\[ 4 : 2 :: 16 : 8 \\quad 6 : 9 :: 12 : 18. \\]\n\nProportional numbers, or numbers in proportion, are usually denominated terms; of which the first and last are called extremes, and the intermediate ones get the name of means, or middle terms.\n\nIf four numbers are proportional, they will also be inversely proportional; that is, the first consequent will be to its own antecedent as the second consequent is to its antecedent; or the fourth term will be to the third as the second is to the first. Thus, if \\( 6 : 2 :: 10 : 5 \\), then by inversion, \\( 3 : 6 :: 5 : 10 \\), or \\( 5 : 10 :: 3 : 6 \\).\n\nEuclid v. 4, cor. By either of these kinds of inversion may any question in the rule of three be proved.\n\nIf four numbers are proportional, they will also be alternately proportional; that is, the first antecedent will\nbe to the second antecedent as the first consequent is to the second consequent; or the first term will be to the third term as the second term is to the fourth. Thus, if \\(8 : 4 :: 24 : 12\\), then, by alternation, \\(8 : 24 :: 4 : 12\\). Euclid v. 16.\n\nBut the celebrated property of four proportional numbers is, that the product of the extremes is equal to the product of the means. Thus, if \\(2 : 3 :: 6 : 9\\), then \\(2 \\times 9 = 3 \\times 6 = 18\\). Euclid vi. 16.\n\nHence we have an easy method of finding a fourth proportional to three numbers given, viz.\n\nMultiply the middle number by the last, and divide the product by the first, the quot gives the fourth proportional.\n\n**Examp.** Given 6, 5, and 36, to find a fourth proportional; put \\(x\\) equal to the fourth proportional, then \\(6 : 5 :: 36 : x\\), and \\(5 \\times 36 = 180 = 6 \\times x\\); therefore, dividing the product 180 by the factor 6, the quot gives the other factor \\(x\\), namely 30, the fourth proportional sought.\n\nEvery question in the rule of three may be divided into two parts, viz. a supposition and a demand; and of the three given numbers, two are always found in the supposition, and only one in the demand.\n\n**Examp.** If 4 yards cost 12 shillings, what will 6 yards cost at that rate?\n\nIn this question the supposition is, If 4 yards cost 12 shillings; and the two terms contained in it are 4 yards and 12 shillings: The demand lies in these words, What will 6 yards cost? and the only term found in it is 6 yards.\n\nThe supposition and demand being thus distinguished, proceed to state the question, or to put the terms in due order for operation, as the following rules direct.\n\n**Rule I.** Place that term of the supposition, which is of the same kind with the number sought, in the middle. The two remaining terms are extremes, and always of the same kind.\n\n**II.** Consider, from the nature of the question, whether the answer must be greater or less than the middle term; and if the answer must be greater, the least extreme is the divisor; but if the answer must be less than the middle term, the greatest extreme is the divisor.\n\n**III.** Place the divisor on the left hand, and the other extreme on the right; then multiply the second and third terms, and divide their product by the first; and the quot gives the answer; which is always of the same name with the middle term.\n\nWhen the divisor happens to be the extreme found in the supposition, the proportion is called direct; but when the divisor happens to be the extreme in the demand, the proportion is inverse.\n\nThe three rules delivered above are indeed so framed, as to preclude the distinction of direct and inverse, or render it needless, the left-hand term being always the divisor; but yet the direct questions being plainer in their own nature, and more easily comprehended by a learner, we shall, in the first place, exemplify the rules by a set of questions of the direct kind, and shall afterwards adduce an example or two of such as are inverse.\n\n---\n\n**I. The Simple Rule of Three Direct.**\n\n**Quest. 1.** If 4 yards cost 12 shillings, what will 6 yards cost at that rate?\n\nThe supposition and demand of this question have already been distinguished, and the two terms in the former are 4 yards 12 shillings, and the only term in the latter is 6 yards.\n\nThe number sought is the price of six yards, and the term in the supposition of the same kind is the price of 4 yards, viz. 12 shillings, which place in the middle, as directed in Rule I, and the two remaining terms are extremes, and of the same kind, viz. both lengths.\n\nIt is easy to perceive that the answer must be greater than the middle term; for 6 yards will cost more than 4 yards; therefore the least extreme, viz. 4 yards, is the divisor, according to Rule II.\n\n| Yds. | s. | yds. |\n|------|----|-----|\n| 4    | 12 | 6   |\n\n\\(4 \\times 12 = 48\\)\n\nTherefore place the divisor 4 yards on the left hand, and the other extreme 6 yards on the right; and multiplying the second and third terms, divide their product by the first term, and the quot 18 is the answer, and of the same name with the middle term, viz. shillings, according to Rule III.\n\nAnd because the divisor is the extreme found in the supposition, the proportion is direct.\n\n**Quest. 2.** If 7 C. of pepper cost 21 l., how much will 5 C. cost at that rate?\n\nThe supposition in this question is, that 7 C. of pepper costs 21 l., and the two terms in it are 7 C. and 21 l.; the demand is, How much will 5 C. cost? and the term in it is 5 C.\n\nThe number sought is the price of 5 C. and the term in the supposition of the same kind is the price of 7 C., viz. 21 l., which place in the middle. The two remaining terms are extremes, and of the same kind, viz. quantities of pepper.\n\nIt is obvious, that the answer must be less than the middle term; for 5 C. will cost less than 7 C.; and therefore the greatest extreme, viz. 7 C. is the divisor.\n\n| C. | L. | C. |\n|----|----|----|\n| 7  | 21 | 5  |\n\n\\(7 \\times 21 = 147\\)\n\nAccordingly place the divisor 7 C. on the left hand, and the other extreme 5 C. on the right; and having multiplied the second and third terms, divide their product by\nby the first term, and the quot 15 is the answer, of the same name with the middle term, viz. L. Sterling.\n\nAnd because the divisor happens to be the extreme in the supposition, the proportion is direct.\n\n**QUEST. 3.** If 13 yards of velvet cost L. 21, what will 27 yards cost at that rate?\n\n*Y.

Thus, the first remainder 8, and the first part of the quotient 43, are both pounds; and the second remainder 4, and the second part of the quotient 12, are both shillings; and the third remainder 9, and the third part of the quotient 3, are both pence; and the fourth remainder 10, and the fourth part of the quotient 2, are both farthings.\n\nAs we have no money under farthings, the last remainder cannot be reduced any lower; so there remains 10 farthings to be divided by 13; that is, there is wanting to complete the quotient, the thirteenth part of 10 farthings, or the thirteenth part of every remaining farthing; that is, ten thirteenth parts of one farthing; so you get the remainder 10 above, and the divisor 13 below a line drawn between them, in the form of a fraction, of which the remainder is the numerator, and the divisor the denominator.\n\n**II. The Simple Rule of Three Inverse.**\n\n**QUEST. 1.** If 8 men can do a piece of work in 12 days, in how many days will 16 men do the same?\n\nIn this question the supposition is; If 8 men do a piece of work in 12 days, and the two terms contained in it are 8 men and 12 days: The demand lies in these words, In how many days will 16 men do the same? and the only term contained in it is 16 men.\n\nThe number sought here is the days in which 16 men will do the work, and the term in the supposition of the same kind is 12 days; wherefore I place 12 days as the middle term, according to Rule I. the two remaining terms are extremes, and of the same kind, viz. both of them men.\n\nIt is obvious that the answer must be less than the middle term; for 16 men will do the work in fewer days than 8 men; and therefore, by Rule II. the greatest extreme, viz. 16, is the divisor; which place on the left hand, and the other extreme on the right, as directed in Rule III. Then multiplying the second and third, and dividing their product by the first, the quotient comes out in days; that is, of the same name with the middle term.\n\nAnd because the extreme found in the demand happens to be the divisor, the proportion is inverse.\n\n**QUEST. 2.** How much plumb of 3 quarters wide will line a cloak that hath in it 4 yards of 7 quarters wide?\n\nHere the answer must be greater than the middle term; for the plumb being narrower than the cloth of which the cloak is made, will require more length.\n\n**QUEST. 3.** If 36 yards be a rood of mason-work, at 3 feet high, how many yards will make a rood at 9 feet high?\n\nFeet, yds. feet;\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n9 : 36 :: 3 \\\\\n3 \\\\\n9)108 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n**Anf.** 12 yards.\n\n**SECT. II. The Compound Rule of Three.**\n\nThe Compound Rule of Three, from five given numbers finds a sixth, or from seven given numbers finds an eighth, or from eleven finds a twelfth, &c.\n\nThis rule easily and naturally admits of subdivisions, which, from the number of the terms given, may be denominated the rule of Five, the rule of Seven, the rule of Nine, the rule of Eleven, &c.\n\nQuestions in the Compound rule of three are also resolved into two parts, viz. a supposition and a demand.\n\nIf five terms be given, three of these are always found in the supposition, and two in the demand; if seven terms be given, four of these are in the supposition, and three in the demand; if nine terms are given, five of these are in the supposition, and four in the demand; if eleven terms be given, six of these are in the supposition, and five in the demand, &c.\n\nThe supposition and demand being distinguished, proceed to state the question; that is, to put the terms in due order for operation, as the following rules direct.\n\n**RULE I.** Place that term of the supposition which is of the same kind with the number sought, in the middle.\nThe remaining terms are extremes, which must be classed into similar pairs, by making each pair consist of one term taken from the supposition, and another of the same kind taken from the demand.\n\nII. Out of each similar pair, joined with the middle term, form a simple question; and in each simple question so formed, find the divisor; viz., consider from the nature of the question, whether the answer must be greater or less than the middle term; and if the answer must be greater, the least extreme is the divisor; but if the answer must be less than the middle term, the greatest extreme is the divisor.\n\nIII. Place all the divisors on the left hand, and the other extremes on the right; then multiply the divisors, or extremes on the left, continually, for a divisor, and multiply the extremes on the right hand and the middle term, continually, for a dividend; and, lastly, divide the dividend by the divisor; and the quotient is the answer, of the same name with the middle term.\n\nThe answer to questions in the compound rule of three may also be had by working the simple questions separately, or by themselves, in the following manner, viz.\n\nThe middle term, with any one pair of similar extremes, make the first simple question, and the answer to this question must be made the middle term to the next similar pair of extremes; and the answer to this second question, must in like manner be made the middle term to the following similar pair of extremes, &c.; and the answer to the last simple question is the number sought.\n\nBut the joint operation prescribed in Rule III, is the shorter as well as the easier method; for in working some of the simple questions, there may happen to be a remainder, and consequently the middle term of the next simple question will have some fractional part; which inconvenience is avoided by working jointly.\n\nIn every simple question, when the divisor is an extreme found in the supposition, the proportion is direct; but when the divisor is an extreme found in the demand, the proportion is inverse.\n\nThe three rules delivered above are indeed so calculated, as to make no difference between direct and inverse, or so as to render that distinction needless, the left-hand extremes being all divisors; but yet, as questions consisting entirely of direct proportions are the plainest and easiest, it will be proper, in the first place, to exemplify the rules by questions of the direct kind, and afterwards introduce such as are inverse.\n\nAnd as questions in the rule of five are by far more numerous, and occur much oftener, than questions in the rule of seven, nine, or eleven; we shall, first of all, give questions in the rule of five, wherein both proportions are direct; then those wherein one or both proportions are inverse; and, lastly, give a few examples of the rules of seven, nine, and eleven.\n\nI. The Rule of Five Direct.\n\nQUEST. I. If 14 horses eat 56 bushels of corn in 16 days, how many bushels will 20 horses eat in 24 days?\n\nThe supposition in this question is, If 14 horses eat 56 bushels in 16 days; and the three terms contained in it are, 14 horses, 56 bushels, and 16 days: The demand is, How many bushels will 20 horses eat in 24 days? and the two terms contained in it are 20 horses, and 24 days.\n\nThe number sought is bushels, and the term in the supposition of the same kind is 56 bushels; therefore, according to Rule I, place 56 bushels in the middle. The remaining four terms are extremes, which you class into similar pairs, by making each pair consist of one term taken from the supposition, and another of the same kind taken from the demand. Thus, 14 horses, and 20 horses make one pair; again, 16 days, and 24 days make another pair.\n\nOut of the several similar pairs, joined with the middle term, you form so many simple questions, according to Rule II. viz. by saying,\n\n1. If 14 horses eat 56 bushels in a certain number of days, how many bushels will 20 horses eat in the same time?\n\n2. If 16 days eat up, or consume, 56, or any other number of bushels, how many bushels will 24 days consume?\n\nIn the first simple question it is obvious, that the answer will be greater than the middle term; for 20 horses will eat more bushels than 14 horses will do in the same time; and so the least extreme, viz. 14, is the divisor; and because 14 is an extreme found in the supposition, the proportion is direct.\n\nIn the second simple question it is also plain, that the answer will be greater than the middle term; for 24 days will consume more bushels than 16 days; and consequently the least extreme, viz. 16, is the divisor; and because 16 is an extreme found in the supposition, the proportion is direct.\n\nAccording to Rule III.\n\nJoint operation.\n\n| Horses | Bushels | Horses |\n|--------|---------|--------|\n| 14     | 56      | 20     |\n| da.    | 16      | 24 da. |\n\n84 480\n\n14 56\n\n224 288\n\n240\n\n224)26880(120\n\n224\n\n448\n\n448\n\n(0)\n\nAns. 120 bushels.\n\nThe quotient or answer comes out of the same name with the middle term, viz. 120 bushels.\nThe two simple questions into which the compound question is resolved, are stated, and wrought separately, as follows.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\nH.

The Rule of Five Inverse.\n\nThe questions that fall under this rule have commonly one of the proportions inverse, and the other direct, and sometimes the upper, and sometimes the lower, is the inverse proportion; and in some few questions both proportions are inverse. Now, though the three rules delivered above make no difference betwixt direct and inverse; yet, to bring the learner to some measure of acquaintance with this useful distinction, we shall, in stating the following questions, expose the same to view, by affixing an asterisk to the extremes of every inverse proportion.\n\nQuest. If 14 horses eat 56 bushels of corn in 16 days, in how many days will 20 horses eat 120 bushels at that rate?\n\nIn this question the supposition is, that 14 horses eat 56 bushels in 16 days; and the demand is, In how many days 20 horses will eat 120 bushels.\n\nThe number sought is days, and the term in the supposition of the same kind is 16 days; and accordingly place 16 days in the middle. The remaining four terms are extremes; which clasps into similar pairs, by making each pair consist of one term taken from the supposition, and another of the same kind taken from the demand. Thus, 14 horses and 20 horses make one pair; again, 56 bushels and 120 bushels make another pair.\n\nOut of the similar pairs, joined with the middle term, form so many simple questions; namely,\n\n1. If 14 horses eat a certain number of bushels in 16 days, in how many days will 20 horses eat the same quantity?\n\n2. If 56 bushels are eaten up in 16 days, in how many days will 120 bushels be eaten up by the same eaters?\n\nIn the first simple question it is plain, that the answer must be less than the middle term; for 20 horses will eat the same number of bushels in fewer days than 14 horses; and so the greatest extreme, viz. 20, is the divisor; and because 20 is an extreme found in the demand, the proportion is inverse.\n\nIn the second simple question it is also obvious, that the answer must be greater than the middle term; for 120 bushels will require more days to be eaten up in than 56 bushels; and therefore the least extreme, viz. 56, is the divisor; and because 56 is an extreme found in the supposition, the proportion is direct.\n\nVol. I. No. 17.\n\nWe now proceed to state the question, by placing the divisors on the left hand, and the other extremes on the right; then multiply and divide, as directed in Rule III. and the answer comes out of the same name with the middle term, viz. 24 days.\n\nJoint operation.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\nHorf. days. \\quad horf. \\\\\n*20 : 16 :: 14* \\\\\nbush. 56 \\quad 120 bush. \\\\\n1120 \\quad 1680 \\\\\n16 \\\\\n1008 \\\\\n168 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\ndays.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n1120 \\quad 26880(24 An. \\\\\n224 \\\\\n448 \\\\\n448 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n(o)\n\nThe two simple questions into which the compound question is resolved, are stated and wrought separately, as follows.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\nHorf. day. \\quad horf. \\\\\n*20 : 16 :: 14* \\\\\n56 : 11\u20144\u201448 :: 120 \\\\\n14 \\quad 24 \\\\\n64 \\quad 48 \\\\\n16 \\quad 22 \\\\\n20 \\quad 24 (11 days. \\\\\n24 \\quad 60 \\\\\n96 (4 hours. \\\\\n16 \\quad 120 \\\\\n60 \\quad 60 \\\\\n56(1935360(34560 \\\\\n96(48 min. \\\\\n168 .... \\\\\n24)576(24 days. \\\\\n255 \\quad 48 \\\\\n224 \\quad \u2014 \\\\\n96 \\\\\n313 \\quad 96 \\\\\n280 \\quad \u2014 \\\\\n336 \\\\\n336 \\\\\n(o)\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nIII. The Rule of Seven, Nine, &c.\n\nQuest. If 15 men eat 156 d. worth of bread in 6 days, when wheat is sold at 12 s. per bushel, in how many days will 30 men eat 520 d. worth of bread when wheat is at 10 s. per bushel?\n\nThis question belongs to the rule of seven, the number sought is days, and the term of the same kind in the supposition is 6 days, which place in the middle. The remaining five terms are extremes, which clasps into similar pairs, by taking one term of each pair out of the supposition, and another of the same kind out of the demand.\nOut of the similar pairs, joined with the middle term, form so many simple questions, in each of which you find the divisor by Rule II.; then place the divisors on the left hand, and the other extremes on the right, as directed in Rule III., and multiply and divide, as follows.\n\n**Joint operation.**\n\n| Men. days. men. |\n|-----------------|\n| *30 : 6 :: 15* |\n| *10 : d. 156*   |\n| 4680            |\n| 10              |\n| 75              |\n| 46800           |\n| 7800            |\n| 12              |\n| 93600           |\n| 6               |\n| 468100          |\n| 561600(12 days.) |\n\n**Ans.**\n\nThis compound question is resolved into three simple ones, as follows.\n\n\\[ \\frac{30}{156} = \\frac{6}{3} = \\frac{15}{520} = \\frac{3}{10} \\]\n\n**Examp.** If 100 lb. of Venice weigh 70 lb. of Lyons, and 120 lb. of Lyons weigh 100 lb. of Roan, and 80 lb. of Roan weigh 100 lb. of Toulouse, and 100 lb. of Toulouse weigh 74 lb. of Geneva, how many pounds of Geneva will 100 lb. of Venice weigh?\n\nThis question belongs to the rule of nine; and because pounds of Geneva is the number sought, the given pounds of Geneva, viz. 74, must be the middle term: the remaining terms are extremes; which may be classed into similar pairs, and stated as follows.\n\n| Tol. Gen. Tol. |\n|----------------|\n| Ven. Ly. 100 : 74 :: 100 Ly. Ven. |\n| 120 : Roan 80 : 100 Roan : 70 : 100 |\n\n\\[ \\frac{8000}{120} = \\frac{10000}{70} = \\frac{960000}{100} = \\frac{700000}{100} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{9600000}{74} = \\frac{518100000}{480} = \\frac{53252\\text{ lb of Geneva}}{380} = \\frac{288}{92} \\]\n\nBut the question becomes more simple, and is wrought with greater ease and advantage, by being stated in the fractional form, as follows.\n\n\\[ \\frac{100 \\times 70 \\times 100 \\times 100 \\times 74}{100 \\times 120 \\times 80 \\times 100} = \\frac{7 \\times 10 \\times 74}{12 \\times 8} = \\frac{5180}{96} = \\frac{53252\\text{ lb of Geneva}}{380} \\]\n\nWe shall conclude by observing, that every compound question, whether in the rule of five, seven, nine, or eleven, &c. properly speaking, consists but of three given terms. For the first term, or divisor, is to be considered as one compound term made up, or produced, by the continual multiplication of the extremes on the left hand, as so many component parts. In like manner, the third term is to be considered as one compound term, made up by the continual multiplication of the extremes on the right, as component parts. Suppose the question to be,\n\nIf L. 100 in 12 months gain L. 5 interest, what will L. 75 gain in 19 months?\n\nHere it is obvious, that it is neither the L. 100 principal, nor the 12 months of time, taken separately, that gains the L. 5 interest; but both contribute their share; that is, they conspire, as joint causes, to produce one effect; and therefore their product, viz. the first term, is to be considered as the cause producing the effect; that is, the first term, viz. 100 \u00d7 12, causeth, produceth, or gains L. 5 of interest. And in like manner, the product of the extremes on the right hand, or the third term, viz. 75 \u00d7 9, is to be esteemed the cause that produceth a similar effect; that is, gains a like sum of interest, namely, the fourth term, or answer. In reference to this way of considering the first and third terms, the question might be stated as under.\n\n\\[ \\text{If } 100 \\times 12 : 5 :: 75 \\times 9 \\]\n\n**Chap. VIII.

It yields very much in swellings; but not so much as the skin, without breaking or cracking.\n\nHard and reiterated frictions loosen it insensibly, and presently afterward, a new stratum arises, which thrusts the first outward, and may itself be loosed and thrust outward by a third stratum, and so on.\n\nThe epidermis adheres very closely to the cutaneous papillae, from which it may be separated by boiling; or by steeping, for a long time, in cold water.\n\nIt adheres still closer to the corpus reticulare, which is easily raised along with it; and they seem to be true portions or continuations of each other.\n\nThe epidermis covers the skin through its whole extent, except at the places where the nails lie. It is marked with the same furrows and lozenges as the skin, and has the same openings and pores; and though it may be said to pass the bounds of the skin, where it is continued inward, through the great openings, yet at these places it loses the name of epidermis.\n\nWhen we examine narrowly the small pores or holes, through which the sweat passes, the epidermis seems to enter these, in order to complete the excretory tubes of the cutaneous glands. The fossulae of the hairs have likewise the same productions of the epidermis, and it seems to give a sort of coat or bark to the hairs themselves. Lastly, the almost imperceptible ducts of the cutaneous pores are lined by it.\n\n**USES OF THE SKIN.**\n\nIt is chiefly and properly the filamentary substance, called the body of the skin, which is the universal integument of the body, and the basis of all the other cutaneous parts; each of which has its particular uses.\n\nThe skin is able to resist external injuries to a certain degree, and such impressions, frictions, strokes, &c., to which the human body is often liable, as would hurt, wound, and disorder the parts of which it is composed, if they were not defended by the skin.\n\nThe papillae are the organ of feeling, and contribute to an universal evacuation, called insensible transpiration. They likewise serve to transmit from without, inwards, the subtle particles or impressions of some things applied to the skin. The first of these three uses depends on the extremities of the nerves, the second on the arterial productions, and the third on the productions of the veins.\n\nThe cutaneous glands secrete an oily humour of different consistencies, and they are likewise the origin of sweat.\n\nThe epidermis serves to keep the pencils or nervous filaments of the papillae in an even situation, and without confusion; and it likewise moderates the impressions of external objects.\n\nAnother use of the epidermis is to regulate the cutaneous evacuations already mentioned, the most considerable of which is insensible transpiration.","sp":301,"ep":301},{"h":"THE HAIRS","t":"The hairs belong as much to the integuments as the nails. They are a kind of reeds or rushes, the roots or bulbs of which lie toward that side of the skin which is next the membrana adiposa. The trunk or beginning of the stem perforates the skin, and the rest of the stem advances beyond the outer surface of the skin, to a certain distance, which is very various in the different parts of the body.\n\nWhen the different hairs are examined by a microscope, we find the roots more or less oval, the largest extremity being either turned toward, or fixed in the corpus adiposum.\n\nThis oval root is covered by a whitish strong membrane, in some measure elastic; and it is connected either to the skin, to the corpus adiposum, or to both, by a great number of very fine vessels and nervous filaments.\n\nWithin the root, we observe a kind of glue, some very fine filaments of which advance toward the small extremity, where they unite and form the stem, which passes through this small extremity to the skin. As the stem passes through the root, the outer membrane is elongated in form of a tube, which closely invests the stem, and is entirely united to it.\n\nThe stem having reached the surface of the skin, pierces the bottom of a small fossula between the papillae, or sometimes a particular papilla, and there it meets the epidermis, which seems to be inverted round it, and to unite with it entirely. A sort of unctuous matter transudes through the sides of the fossula, which is bestowed on the stem, and accompanies it, more or less, as it runs out from the skin, in form of an hair.\n\nSect. II. Of the Abdomen.\n\nThe Abdomen begins immediately under the thorax, and terminates at the bottom of the pelvis of the osa innominata. Its circumference, or outer surface, is divided into regions, of which there are three anterior, viz., the epigastric or superior region, the umbilical or middle region, and the hypogastric or lower region. There is but one posterior region, named regio lumbaris.\nThe epigastric region begins immediately under the appendix ensiformis, at a small superficial depression, called the pit of the stomach, and ends above the navel at a transverse line, supposed to be drawn between the last false ribs on each side.\n\nThis region is subdivided into three parts; one middle, named epigastrium; and two lateral, termed hypochondria. The epigastrium takes in all that space which lies between the false ribs of both sides, and the hypochondria are the places covered by the false ribs.\n\nThe umbilical region begins above the navel, at the transverse line already mentioned, and ends below the navel at another transverse line, supposed to be drawn parallel to the former, between the two crista of the os ilium.\n\nThis region is likewise divided into three parts; one middle, which is properly the regio umbilicalis; and two lateral, called ilia, or the flanks; and they comprehend the space between the false ribs and upper part of the os ilium on each side.\n\nThe hypogastric region is extended downward from the inferior limit of the umbilical region, and is divided into three parts; one middle, called pubis; and two lateral, called inguina, or the groins.\n\nThe lumbar region is the posterior part of the abdomen, and comprehends all that space which reaches from the lowest ribs on each side, and the last vertebra of the back, to the os sacrum and neighbouring parts of the os ilium. The lateral parts of this region are termed the loins, but the middle part has no proper name in men.\n\nLastly, the bottom of the abdomen, which answers to the pelvis of the skeleton, is terminated anteriorly by the pudenda or parts of generation, and posteriorly by the clunes and anus. The buttocks are separated by a fossa, which leads to the anus; and each buttock is terminated downward by a large fold, which distinguishes it from the rest of the thigh.\n\nThe space between the anus and the parts of generation, is called perineum, and is divided into two equal lateral parts by a very distinct line, which is longer in males than in females.\n\nThe cavity of the abdomen, formed by the parts already mentioned, (all which are covered by the skin and membrana adiposa) is lined on the inside by a particular membrane, called peritoneum. It is separated from the cavity of the thorax by the diaphragm, and terminated below by the musculi levatores ani.\n\nThis cavity contains the stomach, and the intestines. It contains likewise the mesentery, mecolon, omentum, liver, gall bladder, spleen, pancreas, glands of the mesentery, vasa lactea, receptaculum chyli, kidneys, renal glands, ureters, bladder, and the internal parts of generation in both sexes.\n\nThe whole fore-part of the abdomen forms an oblong convexity, like an oval vault, more or less prominent in the natural state, in proportion to the quantity of fat upon it, and of food contained in it, or to the different degrees of pregnancy in women. The hypogastric and umbilical regions are more subject to these varieties, than the epigastric region.\n\nThe appendix ensiformis of the sternum, the cartilaginous portions of the last pair of true ribs, those of the first four pairs of false ribs, all the fifth pair, the five lumbar vertebrae, the osa innominata, the os sacrum, and os coccygis, form the bony sides of the cavity of the abdomen.\n\nThe diaphragm, the muscles called particularly musculi abdominis, the quadrati lumborum, psoai, iliaci, the muscles of the coccyx, and of the intestinum rectum, form the chief part of the circumference of this cavity.\n\nThe cavity of the abdomen is of an irregularly oval figure, but still symmetrical. On the foreside it is uniformly arched or oval, and its greatest capacity is even with the navel, and nearest part of the hypogastrium. On the upper side it is bounded by a portion of a vault, very much inclined. On the backside, it is in a manner divided into two cavities by the jutting out of the vertebrae of the loins. On the lower side, it contracts gradually all the way to the little edge of the pelvis, and from thence expands again a little as far as the os coccygis and tubercles of the ilchium, terminating in the void space between these three parts.\n\nPERITON\u00c6UM.\n\nHaving carefully removed the muscles of the abdomen, the first thing we discover is the peritoneum, a membranous covering, which adheres immediately to the inner surface of the musculi transversi, and of all the other parts of this cavity; and involves and invests all the viscera contained therein, as in a kind of bag.\n\nThe peritoneum in general is a membrane of a pretty close texture, and yet very limber, and capable of a very great extension; after which it can recover itself, and be contracted to its ordinary size; as we see in pregnancy, dropsies, corpulency, and repletion.\n\nIt seems to be made up at least of two portions, one internal, the other external; which have been looked upon by many anatomists as a duplicature of two distinct membranous laminae. But, properly speaking, the internal portion alone deserves the name of a membranous lamina, as being the main body of the peritoneum. The external portion is no more than a kind of fibrous or follicular apophysis of the internal; and may properly enough be termed the cellular subfascia of the peritoneum.\n\nThe true membranous lamina, commonly called the internal lamina, is very smooth, and polished on that side which is turned to the cavity and viscera of the abdomen, and continually moistened by a serous fluid discharged through almost imperceptible pores.\n\nThe cellular subfascia, or external portion of the peritoneum, adheres very closely to the parts which form the infolded of the cavity of the abdomen.\n\nThe cellular subfascia has several elongations, which have been called productions of the peritoneum. Two of these productions accompany and invest the spermatic ropes in males, and the vascular ropes, commonly called the round ligaments, in women. There are other two, which pass under the ligamentum Fallopii, with the\ncrural vessels, which they involve, and are gradually lost in their course downward.\n\nTo these four productions of the cellular substance of the peritoneum, we may add a fifth, which is spread on the neck of the bladder, and perhaps a sixth, which accompanies the intestinum rectum. All these elongations pass out of the cavity of the abdomen, and may be termed external, to distinguish them from others that remain in the abdomen, and are called internal, of which hereafter.\n\nThe great blood-vessels, that is, the aorta and vena cava, are likewise involved in this cellular substance of the peritoneum. In a word, it involves immediately and separately all the parts and organs which are commonly said to lie in the duplicature of the peritoneum.\n\nIt has; nevertheless, productions of its own, but they are very different from those of the cellular substance; for they run from without, inward, that is, they advance from the convex side of the great bag of the peritoneum, into the cavity of that bag, some more, some less, and also in different manners; as if the sides of a large ball or bladder were thrust inward into the cavity of the ball or bladder.\n\nOf these internal elongations or intropressions of the true lamina of the peritoneum, some are simply folded, like a duplicature; some are expanded like inverted bags or sacculi to contain some viscous; some begin by a simple duplicature, and are afterwards expanded into a cavity, which contains some organ; some are alternately extended in the form of simple duplicatures, and of cavities; and lastly, some form only a small eminence on the inner surface of the great cavity of the peritoneum.\n\nThe chief uses of the peritoneum are, to line the cavity of the abdomen, to invest the viscera contained in that cavity as in a common bag, to supply them with particular coats, to form productions, ligaments, connexions, folds, vaginae, &c.\n\nThe fine fluid which transudes through the whole internal surface of the peritoneum, prevents the inconveniences which might arise from the continual frictions and motions to which the viscera of the abdomen are exposed either naturally or by external impulses.","sp":302,"ep":304},{"h":"THE MEMBRANA ADIPOSA","t":"AND FAT.**\n\nThe second universal integument of the human body,\nis the membrana adiposa, or corpus adiposum. This is not, however, a single membrane, but a congeries of a great number of membranous laminae, joined irregularly to each other at different distances, so as to form numerous interstices of different capacities, which communicate with each other. These interstices have been named cellulae, and the substance made up of them, the cellulous substance.\n\nThe thickness of the membrana adiposa is not the same all over the body, and depends on the number of laminae of which it is made up. It adheres very closely to the skin, runs in between the muscles in general, and between their several fibres in particular, and communicates with the membrane which lines the inside of the thorax and abdomen.\n\nThe structure is demonstrated every day by butchers, in blowing up their meat, when newly killed; in doing which, they not only swell the membrana adiposa, but the air infuses itself likewise in the interstices of the muscles, and penetrates even to the viscera, producing a kind of artificial emphysema.\n\nThese cellular interstices are so many little bags or fathoms, filled with an unctuous or oily juice, more or less liquid, which is called fat.\n\nThis substance increases in quantity in the body, by rest and good living; and on the contrary, diminishes by hard labour and a spare diet.\n\nThe proportional differences in the thickness of this membrana adiposa, are determined, and may be observed to be regular in some parts of the body, where either beauty or use required it.\n\nThus we find it in great quantities, where the interstices of the muscles would otherwise have left disagreeable hollow or void places; but being filled, and as it were padded with fat, the skin is raised, and an agreeable form given to the part.\n\nIn some parts of the body the fat serves for a cushion, pillow, or mattress; as on the buttocks, where the laminae and cells are very numerous.\n\nThe fat is likewise of great use to the muscles, in preserving the flexibility necessary for their actions, and in preventing or lessening their mutual frictions.","sp":301,"ep":302},{"h":"THE NAILS","t":"The substance of the nails is like that of horn, and they are composed of several planes of longitudinal fibres soldered together. These strata end at the extremity of each finger, and are all nearly of an equal thickness, but of different lengths.\n\nThe external plane or stratum is the longest, and the rest decrease gradually, the innermost being the shortest; so that the nail increases in thickness from its union with the epidermis, where it is thinnest, to the end of the finger, where it is thickest.\n\nThe graduated extremities or roots of all the fibres of which these planes consist, are hollowed for the reception of the same number of very small oblique papillae, which are continuations of the true skin, which having reached to the root of the nail, forms a semilunar fold, in which that root is lodged.\n\nAfter this semilunar fold, the skin is continued on the whole inner surface of the nail. The fold of the skin is accompanied by the epidermis, to the root of the nail exteriorly, to which it adheres very closely.\n\nThree parts are generally distinguished in the nail, the root, body, and extremity. The root is white and in form of a crescent; and the greatest part of it is hid under the semilunar fold already mentioned.\n\nThe crescent and the fold lie in contrary directions to each other. The body of the nail is naturally arched, transparent, and appears of the colour of the cutaneous papillae which lie under it.\n\nThe principal use of the nails is to strengthen the ends of the fingers and toes, and to hinder them from being inverted towards the convex side of the hand or foot, when we handle or press upon anything hard.","sp":302,"ep":302},{"h":"THE PARTS OF GENERATION IN FEMALES","t":"The parts of generation in females are several in number, some of them external, and some internal; and they are all subordinate to one principal internal part, called the uterus.\n\nThe uterus lies between the bladder and intestinum rectum. It is a body inwardly hollow, outwardly of a whitish colour, of a pretty solid substance, and, except in time of pregnancy, of the figure of a flat flask, being in adults about three fingers breadth in length, one in thickness, and two in breadth at one end, and scarcely one at the other.\n\nThe broadest portion is termed the fundus, and the narrowest the neck. Its situation is oblique, the fundus being turned backward and upward, and the neck forward and downward; the broad sides lie next the rectum and bladder, and the narrow sides are lateral.\n\nThe cavity of the uterus is flat, and resembles an oblong triangle, the shortest side of which answers exactly to the fundus, and the two longest sides lie one on the right-hand, the other on the left.\n\nOf the three angles of this cavity, the two which terminate the fundus are perforated each by a narrow duct, which with difficulty admits a hog's bristle. The third angle forms a flat duct wider than the former, which perforates the neck of the uterus lengthwise, and terminates at the extremity of that neck by a transverse opening.\n\nThis opening is termed the internal orifice of the uterus; and, in the natural state, is narrower than the duct of the collum uteri, so that only a small fillet can be passed through it. At the edge of this orifice, are several small holes, answering to the same number of glandular corpules, which discharge a viscid lymph.\n\nThe inner surface of the cavity of the uterus is lined by a very fine membrane, which at the fundus or broad portion is smooth and even, but in the narrow portion which leads to the orifice it is wrinkled in a particular manner.\n\nThe portion of this membrane, which covers the bottom of the cavity, is perforated by a great number of considerable holes, through which small drops of blood may be observed to pass when the whole uterus is compressed.\n\nIn the narrow part, which answers to the collum, each side\nside is divided into two lateral parts, by a kind of prominent longitudinal line, which is larger in the upper or anterior side, than in the lower or posterior.\n\nOn each side of these two longitudinal lines, there are lines or rugae obliquely transverse, and disposed like branches, the longitudinal lines representing trunks. Between and round these rugae, there are small lacunae, through which a mucilaginous fluid is discharged that closes the orifice of the uterus.\n\nThe substance of the body of the uterus is spongy and compact, with a copious intertexture of vessels. Its thickness is nearly equal and uniform in the sides and edges, but the fundus is thicker toward the middle, than toward the two angles; where the thickness decreases gradually. The edges are likewise much thinner near their angles, than near the extremity of the neck.\n\nThe uterus is covered by a portion of the peritoneum, which serves it for a coat, and is the continuation of that which covers the bladder and intestine rectum, running up from the lower and posterior part of the bladder, over the anterior part of the uterus, and from thence over the fundus, and down the backside, and afterwards going to the rectum.\n\nOn each lateral part or edge of the uterus, this portion of the peritoneum forms a broad duplicature, which is extended on each side, more or less directly to the neighbouring lateral parts of the pelvis, forming a kind of membranous septum between the anterior and posterior halves of the cavity of the pelvis; and it is afterwards continued in a loose manner with the peritoneum, on the sides of the pelvis.\n\nThese two broad duplicatures have the name of ligamenta lata, and vesperitiumum ale. The upper edge of each is partly double or folded, forming two small distinct duplicatures.\n\nThe laminae of all these duplicatures are connected by cellular substance, in the same manner as the other duplicatures of the peritoneum; and they contain the Fallopian tubes, the ovaria, a part of the spermatic vessels, and of those that go to the body of the uterus, the ropes called the round ligaments, the nerves, &c.\n\nThe ovaria are two whitish, oval, flat, oblong bodies, situated on the sides of the fundus uteri; to which they are fixed by a kind of short round ligament, and inclosed together with it, in the duplicature of the posterior pinion of the ligamenta lata.\n\nThey are composed of a compact spongy substance, and of several little balls, or transparent vesicles, which are called ovum. The spongy substance surrounds each of these vesicle very closely, and seems likewise to furnish them with distinct spongy coverings or calices.\n\nThe ligaments of the ovaria lie in the edges of the posterior pinions of the ligamenta lata, much in the same manner as the umbilical vein in the anterior or umbilical ligament of the liver. They are round ropes of a filamentary texture, fixed by one extremity to the corner of the fundus uteri, a little above and behind the level of that fundus. They were formerly believed to be hollow, and looked upon as vasa deferentia.\n\nThe Fallopian tubes are two flaccid, conical and vermiform canals, situated more or less transversely on each side of the uterus, between the fundus and the lateral parts of the pelvis, and included in the anterior duplicatures or pinions of the ligamenta lata.\n\nEach of them is fixed by its narrow extremities in the corner of the fundus uteri, into which it opens, though by so narrow a duct, as hardly to admit a large brittle. From thence their diameter augments by degrees all the way to the other extremity, where it is about one third part of an inch. The body of the tube goes in a winding course, and their large extremity is bent toward the ovaria.\n\nThese large extremities are irregularly round, and terminate by a narrow orifice, a little plaited, and turned toward the ovarium, where it presently expands its form of a membranous fringe, full of plaits and incisions. These fringes are called the broad ends of the Fallopian tubes.\n\nThese tubes are composed of fleshy fibres, whereof some are longitudinal, and some obliquely circular, with an intertexture of another very fine substance.\n\nThe anterior pinions of the ligamentum latum serve for a common or external coat to both tubes, and also to connect them, in the same manner as the mesentery connects the intestines. From thence the tubes, and especially their fringes, come to be loose.\n\nThe pubes is that broad eminence at the lower part of the hypogastrium, between the two inguina, on which hairs grow at a certain age. This eminence is owing to a particular thickness of the membrana adiposa which cover the fore-part of the os pubis, and some small portions of the neighbouring muscles.\n\nThe longitudinal cavity which reaches from the middle and lower part of the pubes, within an inch of the anus, was by the ancients termed sinus; and they called the lateral parts of that cavity ale, which is a more proper name than that of labia, commonly given to them. The places where the ale are joined above and below are termed commissures; and may likewise be called the extremities or angles of the sinus.\n\nThe ale are more prominent, and thicker above than below, and lie nearer each other below than above. They are chiefly composed of the skin, cellular substance, and fat. The exterior skin is a continuation of that of the pubes and inguina. It is more or less even, and furnished with a great number of glandular corpuscles, from which a whitish ceruminous matter may be expressed; and after a certain age it is likewise covered in the same manner with the pubes.\n\nThe inner side of the ale is something like the red portion of the lips of the mouth; and it is distinguished everywhere from the external side by a kind of line, in the same manner as the red portion of the lips from the rest of the skin; being likewise thinner and smoother than the outward skin. A great number of pores are observable in it, and also numerous glandular corpuscles which furnish a liquor more or less sebaceous.\n\nNear the inner edge of the inner surfaces of the ale, on each side of the orifice of the canal of the uterus, we find a small hole more visible than the rest. These two holes are termed lacunae; and they communicate by two small ducts with the same number of follicular bodies lying...\ning in the substance of the alae, and which may be looked upon as small prostates answering to the glandular prostates in males. When compressed, they discharge a viscid liquor.\n\nAbove the superior commissure, a thin flat ligament runs down from each small branch of the osa pubis, which penetrates the fat in the substance of each ala, and is lost therein insensibly near the edge. These may be looked upon as the ligamenta suspensoria of the alae. The inferior commissure of the alae is very thin, or like a membranous ligament, and, together with the neighboring parts of the inner sides, it forms a fossula, termed navicularis or scaphoides. The space between the inferior commissure and anus, termed perineum, is about a large finger's breadth in length.\n\nThe other external parts are situated in the sinus, and hid by the alae. Directly under the superior commissure lies the clitoris, with its covering called preputium. A little lower is the orifice of the urethra; and below that is the orifice of the great canal of the uterus. The circumference of this orifice is bordered either by a membranous circle, called hymen, or by fleshy portions, termed carunculae myrtiformes. On each side of the clitoris begins a very prominent fold like a crista, which runs down obliquely on each side of the orifice of the urethra. These folds are termed nymph\u00e6, and they might likewise be named crist\u00e6 clitoridis.\n\nThe clitoris appears at first sight like a small imperforated glans. Its upper and lateral sides are covered by a kind of preputium, formed by a particular fold of a portion of the inner side of the alae; which appears to be glandular, and to discharge a certain moisture, and its inside is granulated.\n\nBy dissection, we discover in the clitoris a trunk and two branches, as in the penis, made up of a spungy substance, and of very elastic coats, but without any urethra. The trunk is divided into two lateral parts of a middle septum, from the bifurcation, to the glans, where it is insensibly lost.\n\nThe bifurcation of the trunk is on the edge of the cartilaginous arch of the osa pubis; and the branches which resemble the roots of the corpora cavernosa are inserted in the inferior rami of these bones, and in those of the osa ischium, where they terminate by degrees; but there is sometimes a membranous tube on each side, which reaches to the tuberosity of the ischium.\n\nThe trunk of the clitoris is sustained by a ligamentum suspensorium fixed in the symphysis of the osa pubis, and containing this trunk in its duplicature, nearly as in the other sex.\n\nFour muscles or fasciculi of fleshy fibres are inserted in the trunk of the clitoris, two on each side. One of them runs down on the foreside of the neighbouring corpus cavernosum, and is inserted by a tendinous or aponeurotic portion, partly in the extremity of the corpus cavernosum, and partly in the tuberosity of the ischium. These two muscles are called erectores.\n\nThe other muscle on each side lies under the former, and runs down on the side of the urethra and great orifice of the uterus, all the way to the anus; increasing gradually in breadth in its passage, and terminating partly like that which is called accelerator in males.\n\nThese two muscles surround very closely the lateral parts of the urethra, and of the great orifice. They expand very much as they descend, and are spread on the lower and lateral parts of the great orifice; for which reason several anatomists have looked upon them as muscular sphincters.\n\nThe nymph\u00e6, crist\u00e6 clitoridis, or, as they may likewise be termed, alae minores five intern\u00e6, are two prominent folds of the inner skin of the great or external alae, reaching from the preputium of the clitoris to the two sides of the great orifice of the uterus. They begin very narrow, and, having increased in breadth in their course downward, they are again contracted at their lower extremity.\n\nThey are of a spungy substance, intermixed with glands, several of which may be perceived by the naked eye. Their situation is oblique, their upper extremities lying near each other, and the lower at a much greater distance. In married women they are more or less flaccid and decayed.\n\nBy the urethra in females, we mean the urinary duct, the orifice of which is between the nymph\u00e6 below the glans of the clitoris. The sides of this orifice are a little prominent and wrinkled, and perforated by small lacun\u00e6, from which a viscid or mucilaginous liquor may be squeezed.\n\nThe body of the urethra is a spungy duct of the same structure as in males, but much shorter, situated directly under the trunk of the clitoris, and above the great canal of the uterus, adhering to each of these canals between which it lies, by membranous filaments. It passes under the cartilaginous arch of the osa pubis, and terminates by an oblique opening at the neck of the bladder.\n\nThe great canal is situated below the urethra, and above the extremity of the intestinum rectum, a little obliquely, being more raised on the inner and back part, than on the outer and fore part.\n\nIts inner or posterior extremity joins the extremity of the body of the uterus, and surrounds its orifice much in the same manner as the duodenum surrounds the pylorus, or as the ilium is surrounded by the c\u00e6cum and colon.\n\nThe anterior extremity forms the great orifice, which lies under that of the urethra, and above the fossula of the inferior commissure of the alae.\n\nThe body of the canal is chiefly made up of a spungy substance, interwoven with numerous blood-vessels; and it is commonly longer and narrower in virgins, than in married women.\n\nIts inner or concave surface, has several transverse rug\u00e6, and is covered by a particular membrane. The rug\u00e6 are formed by oblong narrow eminences, incurved like portions of arches, placed very near each other, and disposed in such a manner as to divide the cavity of the canal into an upper and lower side.\n\nBy the union of the extremities of the upper and lower rug\u00e6, a kind of raphe or future is formed on the right and left sides; and both arches are sometimes intersected in the middle, and so form two half-arches.\nIn general, these arches are very considerable in young persons; become gradually more superficial in married women, and are quite lost in time of delivery.\n\nThe inner or posterior extremity of this great canal surrounds the orifice of the uterus, a little obliquely, in such a manner, as that the upper side of the canal lies very near the orifice, and the lower side at a greater distance from it; and this makes the extremity of the uterus appear to advance more into the canal on the lower than on the upper part.\n\nThe exterior or anterior extremity of the great canal in virgins, and especially before the first eruption of the menes, is commonly bordered by a circular membranous fold, of different breadths, more or less smooth, and sometimes semilunar, which in some subjects leaves but a very small opening, in others a large opening, and in all renders the external orifice narrower than the rest of the cavity. This fold, called hymen, is formed by the union of the internal membrane of the great canal with that on the inside of the ale, and represents a membranous circle of different breadths, and sometimes uneven.\n\nThis membranous circle is commonly ruptured after the consummation of marriage; is quite lost in delivery; and afterwards only some irregular portions of it remain, which, from their supposed resemblance to myrtle leaves, have been termed earunculae myrtiformes. This circle may likewise suffer some disorder by too great a flux of the menses, by imprudence, levity, and other particular accidents.\n\nEach side of the anterior portion of the great canal is covered exteriorly by a thin broad cavernous and vascular plexus, called the plexus retiformis of that canal. These two planes run down on each side of the clitoris behind the nymph\u00e6, and likewise cover the urethra like a collar, before they are spread on the great canal.\n\nThis plexus is strictly united to the muscular portions commonly taken for accelerators or constrictors, lying between these portions and the lateral parts of the urethra and of the great canal.\n\n**Sect. III. Of the Thorax.**\n\nBy the thorax, we commonly understand all that part of the body which answers to the extent of the sternum, ribs, and vertebrae of the back, both outwardly and inwardly.\n\nThe thorax is divided into the anterior part called commonly the breast, the posterior part called the back, and the lateral parts called the right and left sides.\n\nThe external parts of the thorax, besides the skin and membrana adipofa, are principally the mammae, and the muscles which cover the ribs and fill the spaces between them. In the mammae we see the papill\u00e6 or nipples, and a small coloured circle, which surrounds them.\n\nThe internal parts of the thorax are contained in the large cavity of that portion of the trunk, called the middle venter, or cavity of the breast. This cavity is lined by a membrane named pleura, and divided into two lateral cavities by a membranous septum named mediastinum, which is a production or duplicature of the pleura.\n\nThese parts are the heart, pericardium, trunk of the aorta, a portion of the aspera arteria and of the oesophagus, the ductus lacteus or thoracicus, the lungs, &c.\n\nThe hard parts, which form the sides of the cavity of the thorax, are the twelve vertebrae of the back, all the ribs, and the sternum. The soft parts, which complete the sides, are the membrane called pleura, which lines the cavity, and the musculi inter-costales, sterno-costales, and diaphragma.\n\nAll these hard and soft parts taken together represent a kind of cage, in some measure of a conical figure, flattened on the foreside, depressed on the backside, and in a manner divided into two nooks by the figure of the vertebrae of the back, and terminated below by a broad arched basis inclined backward. The intercostal muscles fill up the interspaces betwixt the ribs, and to complete the sides of the cavity; the basis is the diaphragm, and the pleura not only covers the whole inner surface of the cavity, but, by forming the medianum, divides it into two, one on the right hand, the other on the left.\n\n**MAMM\u00c6.**\n\nThe name of mamm\u00e6, or breasts, is given to two eminences more or less round, situated in the anterior and a little toward the lateral parts of the thorax.\n\nThe body of the mamma is partly glandular, and partly made up of fat; or it is a glandular substance mixed with portions of the membrana adipofa, the cellular pellicule of which support a great many blood-vessels, lymphatics, and serous or lactiferous ducts, together with small glandular molecules which depend on the former; all of them being closely surrounded by two membranes continued from the pellicule.\n\nThe innermost of these two membranes, which is in a manner the basis of the body of the mamma, is thick and almost flat, adhering to the musculus pectoralis major. The second or external membrane is thinner, forming a particular integument for the body of the mamma, more or less convex, and adhering closely to the skin.\n\nThe corpus adiposum of the mamma in particular, is a spongy clutter, more or less interlarded with fat, or a collection of membranous pelliculae, which, by the particular disposition of their outer sides, form a kind of membrane in shape of a bag, in which all the rest of the corpus adiposum is contained. The anterior or outer portion of this bag, or that which touches the skin, is very thin; but that side next the pectoralis major, is thick.\n\nThe glandular body contains a white mass, which is merely a collection of membranous ducts, narrow at their origin, broad in the middle, and which contract again as they approach the papilla, near which they form a kind of circle of communication. They are named ductus lactiferi.\n\nThe coloured circle or disk is formed by the skin, the inner surface of which sustains a great number of small glandular molecules. They appear very plainly all over the areola, even on the outside, where they form little flat heights or eminences at different distances quite round the circle.\nThe thymus is an oblong glandular body, round on the upper part, and divided below into two or three lobes, of which that toward the left hand is the longest. In the fetus it is of a pretty large size, less in children, and very little in aged persons.\n\nThe greatest part of the thymus lies between the duplicature of the superior and anterior portion of the mediastinum, and the great vessels of the heart; from whence it reaches a little higher than the tops of the two pleurae, so that some part of it is out of the cavity of the thorax.\n\nIts particular inward structure and secretions are not yet sufficiently known to determine its uses, which however seem to be designed more for the fetus than for adults.","sp":324,"ep":328},{"h":"THE PARTS OF GENERATION IN MALES","t":"The spermatic arteries go out most commonly from the anterior part of the inferior aorta, near each other, and about an inch lower than the arteriae renales.\n\nThey run down obliquely in the posterior part of the abdomen, within the cellular substance of the peritoneum, passing infensibly from behind forward; and so parting gradually more and more from the aorta, they cross over the foreside of the ureters, and run through the openings or rings of the abdominal muscles, along with the elongations or productions of the cellular portion of the peritoneum.\n\nThey are small at their origin; and in their course downward, they give off pretty considerable lateral ramifications to the membrana adiposa, peritoneum, and also to the mesenteries.\n\nThey sometimes pass through the areolae, or meshes of the spermatic veins; and before they go out of the abdomen, they are divided into very fine rami, which run in a more or less winding course, almost parallel to each other.\n\nAfterwards they enter the cellular productions of the peritoneum, which serve them for vaginae. They do not fluctuate indifferently from one side to the other of these vaginae; but are connected along their inner surface by thin membranous laminae, which are likewise continuations of the cellular substance of the peritoneum.\n\nThe arteries continue the same winding course within these vaginae, passing before the vasa deferentia, which are likewise contained in them; and at length they terminate by ramifications in the epididymis and testes.\n\nThe testes are two glandular bodies, situated near each other, without the abdomen, below the interstice between the groins in an adult. The ancients named them didymi or gemini. Their size is nearly that of a pigeon's egg, and they are of an oval figure, a little flattened at each side. We may consider in each testicle, two extremities, two edges, and two sides. One extremity is situated forward, and a little upward; the other backward, and a little downward; and their edges lie upward and downward.\n\nAt the upper edge, they have each an appendix, called epididymis, together with which it is involved in several coverings; and they are both suspended in a common covering, called the scrotum.\n\nEach testicle is a spermatic gland formed by a vast number of fine whitish tubes, folded and twisted in different manners, and distributed in different fasciculi, between membranous septa; the whole being surrounded by a strong common covering, named tunica albuginea.\n\nThese septa are disposed longitudinally, divercating from each other on one side, and approaching on the other. They approach each other along one edge of the testicle, and terminate in a long narrow whitish body, as in a kind of axis.\n\nFrom thence they divercate in a regular manner, and are fixed by their opposite edges in the inner surface of the tunica albuginea, of which they appear to be a continuation. This white body may be termed the nucleus of the testicle.\n\nFrom this description, we see that all these septa are not of an equal breadth; that the interstices between them are in some measure triangular; and that the extent of the small tubes, which lie therein, must be very considerable. They have been reckoned to amount to many ells, by taking the sum of all their several portions; and they may be easily unfolded by a long maceration, which destroys the delicate substance by which all their folds and convolutions are connected and tied down.\n\nAll these small canals seem to terminate by a smaller number of common trunks at the white body or nucleus already mentioned; which trunks do afterwards pierce the upper part of the anterior extremity of the testicle, and are disposed in several folds along the lateral external part of the upper edge, all the way to the posterior extremity. From this union arises a long whitish plaited fasciculus or bundle, called epididymis, or appendix to the testicle.\n\nThe epididymis thus formed, may be reckoned a production of the testicle, or a kind of testis accessorius;\nand it resembles in some measure an arch supported by its center or frame. It is more contracted at the middle, than at the extremities, by which it is closely united to those of the testicle.\n\nBetween its extremities it does not immediately touch the testicle, but is only loosely connected to it, by the duplicature of a very fine and almost transparent membrane, as by a kind of ligament. This membrane is the continuation and duplicature of the tunica albuginea or proper coat of the testicle, which having supplied the place of a ligament to the epididymis afterwards invests it.\n\nThe epididymis is flat, a little concave on the under side, or that next the testicle, irregularly convex on the upper side, or that turned from the testicle; and these two sides are distinguished by two angular edges; by the innermost of which, it is connected to the testicle, in the manner already said; but the outer edge and flat side are loose and free.\n\nThe anterior extremity or head of the epididymis arises from the testicle; and the posterior extremity or tail, which likewise adheres very closely to it, is incurvated from behind, forward, and a little upward, and contracting by degrees, forms a particular canal, termed vas deferens, which shall be described after the scrotum.\n\nThe scrotum is the cutaneous covering of the testes. Outwardly, it is a bag common to both, formed by a continuation of the skin of the neighboring parts, and commonly very uneven, having a great number of rugae on its outer surface. Internally it is fleshy, and forms a muscular capsule for each testicle, termed dartos.\n\nThe exterior or cutaneous portion of the scrotum is nearly of the same structure with the skin in general, of which it is a continuation; only it is something finer, and it is likewise plentifully stored with sebaceous glands and bulbs or roots of hairs.\n\nThough it is a common covering for both testicles, it is nevertheless distinguished into two lateral parts by a superficial and uneven prominent line which appears like a kind of suture, and from thence has been termed raphe.\n\nThis line is a continuation of that which divides in the same manner the cutaneous covering of the penis; and it is continued through the perineum, which it divides likewise, all the way to the anus. It is only superficial, and does not appear on the inside of the skin.\n\nThe inner surface of this cutaneous bag is lined by a very thin cellular membrane, through which bulbs and glands appear very distinctly when we view its inside.\n\nThe dartos, or fleshy portion of the scrotum, is a true cutaneous muscle; the fibres of which are for the most part strongly connected to the skin, running through the cellular substance which lies between these two portions in place of a membrana adiposa, but without the least appearance of fat. This muscle is thin, and by the disposition of its fibres forms a bag with two cavities, or two small bags joined laterally to each other, and contained within the cutaneous portion.\n\nThe lateral parts of these two bags, which are turned from each other, are longer than those which are joined together; and by this union a septum is formed between the testes, which may be called mediastinum scroti.\n\nThe raphe or suture already mentioned adheres to the edge of this septum, and thereby braces down the middle of the cutaneous portion, which from thence appears to have in part two cavities.\n\nThe aponeurotic or ligamentary expansion of the dartos is fixed in the ramus of the os pubis, between the musculus triceps and the origin of the corpus cavernosum of the same side, all the way to the lower part of the symphysis of these bones.\n\nThe vasa deferentia are two white solid flattened tubes, one lying on the right side, the other on the left. From the epididymis, of which they are continuations, each of them runs up in the cellular vagina of the spermatic vessels, as high as the openings in the abdominal muscles; the blood-vessels lying forward, and the vas deferens behind them.\n\nThis fasciculus, thus formed by the blood-vessels, vas deferens, and their common covering, is termed the spermatic rope. The covering is smoother on the outer than on the inner side, and for that reason it has been looked upon as a vagina; the internal substance of which is most cellular, and connects all the vessels together, while the external forms a covering to invest them.\n\nThe vas deferens having reached the membranous lamina of the peritoneum, where that lamina runs over the orifice of the vagina, separates from the blood vessels, and runs backward, in form of an arch, in the cellular substance of the peritoneum, as far as the nearest side of the bladder.\n\nIt passes afterwards behind the body of the bladder, to which it adheres very closely, as also to the lamina of the peritoneum which covers it, and then continues its arched course towards the neck of the bladder, where both vasa deferentia meet, and their arches terminate.\n\nIn this course, the vas deferens passes behind and crosses the neighbouring umbilical artery; crosses the extremity of the ureter of the same side, in its passage between that extremity and the bladder; and having got behind the bladder, it meets the vas deferens of the other side between the insertions of the ureters, and they run down together to the neck of the bladder.\n\nThis canal, which at the origin of the epididymis is pretty large and plaited, becomes immediately afterward smaller and smoother, and continues in that form till it gets behind the bladder, where it begins again to be larger and more uneven.\n\nIt arises from the angular portion or posterior extremity of the epididymis, and from thence runs forward in a very oblique course, on the posterior half of the epididymis, where it is a little incurvated as it joins the backside of the spermatic vessels.\n\nThe cavity of the vas deferens is cylindrical, though the whole tube is flat, and its external circumference oval; and the cavity enlarges as it passes behind the bladder. The termination of these canals must be referred to the history of the urethra.\n\nThe particular coverings of the testes are commonly called coats; and they are reckoned to be three in number; the tunica musculosa, named cremaster, vaginalis and albuginea. The first two are common to each testicle, and to the spermatic rope that belongs to it; and the third is peculiar to the testicle alone.\nThe tunica vaginalis is the most considerable of the three, and must be described first, in order to conceive the structure and connection of the cremaster, which is very improperly called a coat. The albuginea has been already described with the testes.\n\nThe tunica vaginalis is a continuation of the vagina of the spermatic rope, which, as it approaches the testicle, is gradually dilated, and forms two capsules, one contained within the other, the external being the longest and broadest at bottom; so that there is a void space there left between them, in which the testicle is lodged.\n\nThe inner surface of this coat is lined by a fine membrane, which strengthens the bottom of the vagina, and forms a kind of diaphragm, which prevents all communication between the vagina of the spermatic rope and the tunica vaginalis of the testicle.\n\nThe cremaster, improperly termed a coat, is a thin muscle or fleshy plane, which runs down round the vagina of the spermatic rope, and terminates in the tunica vaginalis of the testicle.\n\nIt surrounds almost the whole vagina, and afterwards expands itself on the upper and external part of the tunica vaginalis, in which it is inserted and loosed.\n\nIt arises partly from the ligamentum Fallopii, and partly from the lower edge of the internal oblique muscle of the abdomen; and on this account it seems sometimes to arise from the spine of the os ilium.\n\nThe corpora cavernosa are two ligamentary and very limber tubes, united laterally to each side, through the greatest part of their length, and solid at their two extremities, two of which are connected together, and rounded like the end of a finger; the other two divericate, like the branches of the greek Y, and diminishing gradually in size after the divarication, terminate in an oblique point. These divericated and pointed extremities may be called the roots, and the round extremities the heads.\n\nThese two bodies are almost cylindrical, being round, and of an equal diameter from the roots to the heads, where they are in some measure conical. The ligamentary substance of their sides is elastic, and composed of fine close fibres, which are partly transverse, and partly more or less oblique.\n\nThe cavity of these ligamentary tubes is entirely filled by a strong cellular or cavernous substance, which does not seem to be a continuation of the substance of the sides. These cells communicate with each other, and are always more or less full of blood, resembling pretty much the cellular substance of the spleen; only with this difference, that the sides of the cells are thicker in these cavernous bodies, and without any additional substance.\n\nBy the union of the two corpora cavernosa, two external grooves are formed, one on the upper side, the other on the lower. The lower groove is something broader than the upper, and it is filled through its whole length by a third tube, narrower than the corpora cavernosa, called the urethra.\n\nThe roots of the corpora cavernosa are fixed, each to the edge of the small ramus of the os ilchium and os pubis. They meet at the symphysis of the os pubis, where each of them becomes a cylindrical tube, and unites with the other in the manner already said.\n\nThe heads or rounded extremities join the basis of a distinct body, called the glans, which is an expansion of the urethra, and closely united to it.\n\nBy the union of the corpora cavernosa from their roots to their round extremities or heads, a particular septum is formed by the transverse fibres of both. Between the fibres of this septum several small void spaces are left, by which the corpora cavernosa communicate with each other.\n\nThe urethra is the third spungy tube which composes the penis, and it adheres to the corpora cavernosa through the whole length of the inferior groove formed by their union. It differs from the other two, both as it is narrower, and as it forms a true hollow canal. Its substance is spungy or cavernous, except a small portion next the bladder, and its inner and outer surfaces are membranous.\n\nIt is at first no more than a membranous canal continued from the anterior opening of the bladder, at the place called the neck of the bladder.\n\nAbout a finger's breadth and an half from its origin, it joins a cavernous substance like that of the two other tubes, only smaller, which surrounds it through the whole extent of the inferior groove of the corpora cavernosa.\n\nBut before this spungy substance begins to surround the urethra, it forms a distinct oblong body, like a pear or onion, which is connected only to the lower convex side of the canal, and afterwards, being split on each side, invests it quite round. This body is called the bulb of the urethra, being larger than any other part of that canal, and divided interiorly by a very fine membranous septum, into lateral parts; and therefore when it is inflated, it appears to be double or with two heads.\n\nThe first portion of the urethra, or that which is not covered by the cavernous substance, and which from the bladder to the bulb is only a membranous canal, is sustained by a large solid whitish mass, of the figure of a chestnut, and situated between the bladder and the bulb of the urethra, its basis being toward the bladder, the apex or point toward the urethra, and the sides lying upward and downward.\n\nThis body is termed the prostates, from a greek word that expresses its situation before the vesicule seminales, and implies a plurality, because it appears to be divided into two lateral lobes, by a hollow groove which runs through its upper side from the basis to the apex. The first portion of the urethra lies in this groove, adhering very closely to the prostates which surround it.\n\nThe body of the prostates lies on the intestinum rectum, and the apex is under the internal labium of the cartilaginous arch of the os pubis. The inner substance is spungy, but very compact; and in each lobe there are several folliculi which open into the first portion of the urethra, toward the bottom of the groove.\n\nThe spungy substance of the urethra, having reached the extremity of the corpora cavernosa, forms a large head, called the glans, which crowns the three spungy pillars,\npillars; with this difference however, that it is a continuation of the spungy substance of the urethra, and only adheres to the extremity of the corpora cavernosa without any direct communication.\n\nThe figure of the glans is that of a rounded cone, a little flattened at the lower part, and with an oblique prominent basis, the circumference of which is something greater than that of the corpora cavernosa.\n\nThe spungy substance of the glans is thick and uniform next the corpora cavernosa; but next the urethra, it is perforated by a continuation of that canal, and is there no thicker than the urethra before the formation of the glans.\n\nTherefore the canal of the urethra does not lie in the middle of the glans, but continues its direct course thro' the lower flat side of it, all the way to the extremity, where it terminates by an oblong orifice.\n\nAll the convex surface of the glans is covered by a fine villous substance; and that again by a fine membrane, resembling the red part of the lips. The circumference of the basis of the glans has a double row of small papillae, which may be reckoned sebaceous glands, from which a thick matter is discharged.\n\nAt the bottom of the cavity of the first portion of the urethra, or that which lies within the prostates, there is a small oblong oval eminence; pretty large on the back part, and terminating forward in a point, called caruncula or verumontanum. The large portion of it is commonly perforated by two holes, sometimes only by one, and very seldom by three; and these are the excretory orifices of the vesiculae seminales. Each orifice has a small thin membranous border, which may serve for valves to the excretory ducts of the vesiculae.\n\nOn each side of the large portion of the caruncula, there are five or six holes ranked in form of a crescent round its lateral parts; which are the orifices of the excretory ducts of the prostates that come from the folliculi already mentioned, and run in an oblique course to the orifices, in a kind of membranous duplicature.\n\nThe vesiculae seminales are soft whitish knotty bodies, about three or four fingers breadth in length, one in breadth, and about three times as broad as thick, situated obliquely between the rectum and lower part of the bladder, in such a manner, as that their superior extremities are at a distance from each other, and their lower extremities united between those of the vasa deferentia, of which they imitate both the obliquity and the incurvation.\n\nThey are irregularly round on the upper part, and their breadth decreases gradually from thence. By the union of their lower extremities, they form a kind of fork, the branches of which are broad, and bent like rams horns. These extremities are very narrow, and form a small neck, which runs behind the bladder toward its orifice, and continues its course in the groove of the prostates, through the substance of the contiguous portion of the urethra, till its extremities pierce the caruncula in the manner already said.\n\nThe inner substance of the vesiculae is plaited, and in a manner distinguished into several capsulae, by contorted folds. Their external surface is covered by a fine membrane, which serves for a border and frenum to the folds, and is a true continuation of the cellular substance of the peritoneum. The vesiculae may easily be unfolded, and all their convolutions straightened, and by this means they become much longer than in their natural state.\n\nTheir inner surface is villous and glandular, and continually furnishes a particular fluid, which exalts, refines, and perfects the semen, which they receive from the vasa deferentia, and of which they are the reservoirs for a certain time.\n\nThe passage of the vasa deferentia into the vesiculae is very particular. It was observed, that these canals are incurved behind the bladder, and that their contracted extremities unite at that place. They unite in an angle, and run between the contiguous extremities of the vesiculae; and this union is so close, that the adhering portions seem to form only one middle septum, between two small tubes, each of which is formed, partly by the extremity of one vas deferens, and partly by that of the neighbouring vesicula.\n\nThis lateral union of the extremities of the vas deferens, and vesicula seminalis on each side, forms likewise a kind of short septum, which terminates in a crescent, like a small semilunar valve, and the extremity of the vas deferens is narrower than that of the vesicula. By this mechanism, the fluid contained in each vas deferens has liberty to enter the contiguous vesicula, but that contained in the vesicula cannot return into the other canal.\n\nAfterwards the two small tubes, formed each by the extremities of the vas deferens and vesicula, run in between the basis of the prostates, and canal of the urethra; and perforating the sides of that canal obliquely, they terminate in the caruncula.\n\nThe inside of the canal of the urethra is lined by a fine membrane, full of capillary blood-vessels; and its surface is perforated by a great number of oblong holes or small lacunae of different sizes, the largest lying near the glans.\n\nThese lacunae, or orifices of the excretory ducts of the same number of small glands, are dispersed through the substance of the urethra. Which ducts run for some way in the spungy substance, along the convex side of the internal membrane of the urethra, and open obliquely from behind, forward into the great canal. The edges of the lacune are semilunar, or like a crescent.\n\nA little way from the beginning of the cellular substance of the urethra, we meet with two lacunae more considerable than the rest, and their ducts are very long. These lacunae and ducts lead to two glandular bodies, situated on the two convex sides of the spungy substance of the urethra near the bulb. Each of them is about the size of a cherry-stone, but they are oblong and flat, and covered entirely by the muscles called acceleratores. These two bodies are commonly called prostatic inferioris.\n\nThe cavity of the urethra resembles nearly that of a small writing pen. It is not everywhere round, and towards the gland becomes broader and flatter on one side, especially in the gland itself, where there is a kind of oval or navicular fossula.\n\nThis canal terminates at the extremity of the glans\nby a narrow oblong orifice or fissure, which is much less than the rest of the cavity. The commissures of this small fissure are turned one toward the convex, the other toward the flat side of the glans; and the labia of the fissure are its lateral parts; and it seems to be surrounded by fleshy fibres.\n\nThe preputium is a continuation of the skin of the pubis and scrotum, and it adheres all the way to the basis of the glans. The rest of the cutaneous integument covers the glans without adhesion, and terminates by an opening. This portion is named preputium, and along the whole lower or back side, both of the whole integument in general, and of the preputium in particular, there runs a fine fissure, which is a continuation of the raphe of the perineum and scrotum.\n\nThe inner surface of the preputium is lined with a fine membrane from the opening all the way behind the basis of the glans; and the same membrane is folded from behind, forward, round the glans, forming the proper integument thereof, and covering very closely its whole villous surface, as far as the orifice of the urethra, where it joins the membrane, which lines the inside of that canal.\n\nThis proper membrane of the glans, and internal membrane of the preputium, form conjointly along the flat part of the glans, from its basis to the orifice of the urethra, a membranous duplicature, which like a septum or mediastinum divides this part into two lateral portions, and limits the motions of the preputium; for which reason it is called frenum preputii.\n\nThe surface of the internal membrane of the preputium discharges a fluid which prevents it from adhering to the glans.\n\nSeveral muscles are inserted in the parts which we have described in this paragraph.\n\nThe first two muscles are commonly termed erectores, or acceleratores urinae. The next two are called acceleratores. The four small muscles, two of which are superior, and two inferior, may be called prostatici.\n\nThe erectores lie along the roots of the corpora cavernosa; each of them being fixed by one extremity very obliquely, in the internal labium of the ramus of the os ilium, from the tuberosity upward. From thence it accompanies the root of the corpus cavernosum, all the way to the symphysis of the os pubis, and is fixed by its other extremity in the corpora cavernosa, near their union; where the fibres of both bodies meet, and are reciprocally expanded over both corpora. They lie a little lower, and more interiorly, than the roots of these cavernous bodies.\n\nThe musculi transversi, called also triangulares, are two long, narrow, fleshy fasciculi, inserted each by one extremity in the root or beginning of the ramus of the os ilium; from whence they run transversely along the edge of the interosseous ligament of the os pubis, as far as the apex of the prostates, where their other extremities meet, and form commonly a kind of digastric muscle, the middle of which gives insertion to the muscles of the urethra, and to the cutaneous sphincters of the anus.\n\nThe superior prostatici are two thin planes, fixed in the upper part of the inside of the small rami of the os pubis; from whence they are spread over and inserted in the prostates. Their insertions in the os pubis are on one side of those of the obturatores interni.\n\nThe prostatici inferiores are small transverse planes, each of which is fixed in the symphysis, between the ramus of the os pubis and os ilium, and from thence runs transversely, till it meets its fellow from the other side under the prostates, to which they are both strongly connected, and they serve like a girth to sustain these glands.","sp":320,"ep":324},{"h":"THE SKIN","t":"The skin is a substance of very large extent, made up of several kinds of tendinous, membranous, vascular, and nervous fibres, the intertexture of which is so much the more wonderful, as it is difficult to unfold; for their directions are as various as those of the stuff of which an hat consists.\n\nThis texture is what we commonly call leather, and it makes, as it were, the body of the skin. It is not easily torn, may be elongated in all directions, and afterwards recovers itself, as we see in fat persons, in women with child, and in swellings; and it is thicker and more compact in some places than in others.\n\nIts thickness and compactness are not, however, always proportionable; for on the posterior parts of the body, it is thicker and more lax than on the fore-parts; and on the palms of the hands, and soles of the feet; it is both very thick and very solid.\n\nThe outer surface of this substance is furnished with small eminences, which anatomists have thought fit to call papill\u00e6, in which the capillary filaments of the cutaneous nerves terminate by small radiated pencils.\n\nThese papill\u00e6 differ very much in figure and disposition in the different parts of the body, and they may be distinguished into several kinds.\n\nThe greatest part of them is flat, of different breadths, and separated by fulci, which form a kind of irregular lozenges. The pyramidal figure ascribed to them, is not natural, and appears only when they are contracted by cold or by diseases.\n\nThe papill\u00e6 of the palm of the hand, of the sole of the foot, and of the fingers and toes, are higher than on the other parts of the body; but they are likewise smaller, closely united together, and placed as it were endwise, with respect to each other, in particular rows, which represent on the skin all kinds of lines, straight, crooked, waving, spiral, &c. These several lines are often distinctly visible in those parts of the palm of the hand which are next the first phalanges of the fingers.\n\nThe red part of the lips is made up of papill\u00e6, representing very fine hairs or villi, closely united together.\n\nThere is another particular kind under the nails; the papill\u00e6 being there more pointed, or in a manner conical, and turned obliquely towards the ends of the fingers.\nThose which are found in the hairy scalp, scrotum, &c., are still of other kinds.\n\nThe papillae of the first and second kinds appear to be surrounded at their bases by a soft mucilaginous and pretty viscid substance, which fills the interstices between them, and represents a kind of net-work or sieve, the meshes or holes of which surround each papilla. This substance is commonly called corpus reticulare, or mucosum.\n\nThis vascular texture is of various forms and figures in the different parts of the body.\n\nThe inner surface of the skin is covered by very small tubercles, commonly called cutaneous glands, or glandulae miliares.\n\nThese tubercles are partly fixed in small fossulae, in the substance of the skin, which answer to the same number of small cavities in the corpus adiposum. Their excretory ducts open on the outer surface of the skin, sometimes in the papillae, and sometimes on one side of them.\n\nThe greatest part of them furnishes sweat, and others a fatty oily matter of different thicknesses, as in the hairy scalp, in the back, behind the ears, and at the lower part of the nose, where this matter may be squeezed out, in form of small worms.\n\nBesides these corpulecules, there are other small solid bodies, almost of an oval figure, contained in the substance of the skin. These are the roots or bulbs from whence the hairs arise, and some of them are situated within the inner surface of the skin.\n\nThe skin has several considerable openings, some of which have particular names; such as the fissure of the palpebrae, the nares, the mouth, the external foramen of the ears, the anus, and openings of the parts of generation.\n\nBesides these, it is perforated by an infinite number of small holes, called pores, which are of two kinds. Some are more or less perceivable to the naked eye; such as the orifices of the milky ducts of the mammae, the orifices of the excretory canals of the cutaneous glands, and the passages of the hairs.\n\nThe other pores are imperceptible to the naked eye, but visible through a microscope; and their existence is likewise proved by the cutaneous transpiration, and by the effects of topical applications; and from these two phenomena, they have been divided into arterial and venal pores.","sp":300,"ep":301},{"h":"THENAR","t":"This is a very thick fleshy muscle, in some measure pyriform, lying on the first phalanx of the thumb toward the palm of the hand, the large eminence in which is chiefly formed by it.\n\nIt is fixed to the bone which supports the thumb, and to the neighbouring part of the great internal annular ligament of the carpus.

It is fixed, by one end, in the fore-part of the great tuberosity of the os calcis; and running forward from thence, it terminates in a kind of short tendon, which is fixed in the tuberosity and posterior part of the lower side of the fifth bone of the metatarsus.\n\n**PARATHENAR MAJOR.**\n\nThis is a pretty long muscle, forming part of the outer edge of the sole of the foot.\n\nIt is fixed backwards by a fleshy body, to the outer part of the lower side of the os calcis, from the small posterior external tuberosity, all the way to the anterior tuberosity. There it joins the metatarsus, and at the basis of the fifth metatarsal bone separates from it again, and forms a tendon, which is inserted in the outside of the first phalanx of the little toe, near its basis, and near the insertion of the parathenar minor.\n\n**PARATHENAR MINOR.**\n\nThis is a fleshy muscle, fixed along the posterior half of the outer and lower side of the fifth bone of the metatarsus. It terminates under the head of that bone, in a tendon which is inserted in the lower part of the basis of the first phalanx of the little toe.\n\nUses of the Muscles which move the Tarsus and the other Bones of the Foot.\n\nThe tibialis anticus bends the foot, that is, turns the point of the foot toward the leg; which motion is performed by the ginglymoid articulation of the astragalus with the tibia and fibula. It likewise bends the leg on the foot, or hinders its extension.\n\nBy its lateral insertion in the os cuneiforme maximum, it moves this bone in particular over the anterior extremity of the os calcis; by which the sole of the foot is turned inward toward the other.\n\nThe peroneus medius bends the foot, and hinders the leg from falling back in the same manner as the tibialis anticus. By its insertion in the tuberosity of the fifth metatarsal bone, it turns the sole of the foot outward at the same time that it bends it, when it acts without the assistance of the tibialis anticus.\n\nThe peroneus minimus is an assistant to the medius in the flexion of the foot, in preserving the equilibrium of the leg, and in turning the sole of the foot outward.\n\nThe gastrocnemii and soleus make a kind of triceps; and, by their common tendon, extend the foot, and keep it extended against the strongest resistance. It is by their means that we raise the whole body, even with an additional burden, when we stand a tip-toes; and that we walk, run and jump.\n\nThe gastrocnemii, by their insertion in the os femoris, may, in great efforts, move the leg on the thigh, and the thigh on the leg, as assistants to the biceps, semimembranosus, semi-tendinosus, gracilis internus, and sartorius.\n\nThe soleus, by the multitude of its fleshy fibres and its penniform structure, is more proper for strong than large motions, and seems principally to sustain the gastrocnemii in the motions begun by them. The tendinous portions of this muscle and of the gastrocnemii, though they form a strong tendon all together, seem nevertheless to slide a little upon each other in the different flexions and extensions of the foot.\n\nAnatomists are not agreed with regard to the use of the tibialis gracilis.\n\nWhen the tibialis posterior acts alone, it extends the foot obliquely inward. When it acts together with the gastrocnemii and soleus, it changes the straight direction of their motion to an oblique one. When it acts with the tibialis anticus, the sole of the foot is turned more directly inward, or toward the other foot.\n\nWhen the peroneus longus or maximus acts alone, it may extend the foot hanging freely in the air; but then this extension is obliquely outward. Together with the gastrocnemii and soleus, it likewise changes their direction to an oblique extension outward.\n\nThe extensor pollicis longus extends the two phalanges of the great toe; and it may likewise be an assistant to the tibialis anticus.\n\nThe flexor pollicis longus not only bends the second phalanx of the great toe, but may likewise serve, in great efforts, as an assistant to the extensors of the tarsus. This muscle is of great use in climbing up a steep place.\n\nThe thenar bends the first phalanx of the great toe. When the portion nearest the inner edge of the foot either acts alone, or acts more than the rest, the great toe is separated from the other toes, especially if it be at the same time extended.\n\nThe antithenar, acting with the thenar, bends the first phalanx of the great toe. When it acts alone, especially if the great toe is bent, it brings it nearer the other toes, in proportion to the degrees of action of its different portions.\n\nThe two extensores digitorum communes concur in extending the four small toes; and, as the extensor longus is not near so fleshy as that of the hand, this difference is made up by the extensor brevis. The longus alone seems to extend the first phalanges; and they both join in the extension of the second and third phalanges; the brevis, by the obliquity of its direction, moderating the\naction of the longus, which otherwise would have turned\nthe toes obliquely the contrary way.\n\nThe perforatus or flexor digitorum brevis, bends the\nsecond phalanges; and the perforans or flexor longus,\nthe third; the use of these muscles being nearly the same\nwith those of the perforatus and perforans of the hand.\n\nThe flexor accessorius is an assistant to the perforans,\nincreasing its force on some occasions. It likewise di-\nrects the tendon of that muscle; for by contracting, at\nthe same time that the fleshy belly of the perforans is in\naction, it makes the tendons go in a straighter line to the\ntoes than they would otherwise do, because of their obli-\nquity.\n\nThe lumbricales have nearly the same functions in the\nfoot as in the hand; and they are partly assisted, and\npartly directed, by the flexor accessorius.\n\nThe interossei of the foot have the same uses as in the\nhand. The first superior muscle brings the second toe\nnear the great toe; the other three bring the second,\nthird, and fourth toes near the little toe. The three\ninferior muscles move the last three toes toward the other\ntwo.\n\nThe metatarsius moves the last bone of the metatarsus,\nmuch in the same manner as the metacarpus does that\nof the metacarpus.\n\nThe transversalis may assist the metatarsius in this\naction, which is supposed to be of use to tilers in climb-\ning. The antitendinous may likewise concur, and the pe-\nronaeus minimus may serve to counterbalance these mus-\ncles, and to bring the metatarsus back to its natural si-\ntuation.\n\nThe paratenar major serves particularly to separate\nthe little toe from the rest; and the paratenar minor\nbends the first phalanx of that toe.\n\nSect. XIII. The Muscles employed in Respiration.","sp":253,"ep":255},{"h":"TRANSVERSO-SPINALIS LUMBORUM","t":"SACER VETERIBUS.**\n\nThis muscle is composed of several oblique converging or transverso-spinal muscles, in the same manner as in the back and neck; and it lies between the spinal and oblique apophyses of the loins, reaching to the os sacrum.\n\nThe lowest of these muscles are fixed to the superior lateral parts of the os sacrum, to the ligamentum sacro-iliacum, and to the posterior superior spine of the os ilium. The rest are fixed to the three lowest transverse apophyses, and to the four lowest oblique apophyses of the loins, and to their lateral tubercles. From thence they run up to all the spinal apophyses of these vertebrae, the external, or those that appear first, being longer than the internal, which lie immediately on the vertebrae, especially toward the lower part.\n\n**SPINALES ET TRANSVERSALES LUMBORUM.**\n\nThere are some fasciculi which run up from the superior false spines of the os sacrum, to the lower spinal apophyses of the loins, which may be looked upon as so many spinales lumborum majores. There are likewise some spinales minores between the spinal apophyses of the loins, and transversales minores between the transverse apophyses, which are sometimes of a considerable breadth.\nQuadratus Lumborum sive Lumbaris Externus.\n\nThis is a small, oblong, flat muscle, irregularly square, narrower at its upper than at its lower part, lying along the sides of the vertebrae lumborum, between the last false rib and the os ilium.\n\nIt is fixed below to the external labium of almost all the posterior half of the crista ossis ilium, to the ligamentum sacro-iliacum, and a little to the os sacrum, by a fleety plane, the fibres whereof run obliquely backward.\n\nFrom thence it runs up between the sacro-lumbaris and psoas, by both which it is partly hid, and is inserted in the extremities of all the transverse apophyses of the loins by oblique tendinous digitations. It is likewise fixed by a broad insertion in the twelfth rib, on the inside of the ligament that lies between it and the longissimus dorsi, by which that rib is connected to the first vertebra of the loins.\n\nMusculi Ossis Coccygis.\n\nThese are small, thin, radiated muscles, lying on the inner or concave side of the os sacrum, and neighbouring parts of the pelvis. They are four in number, two on each side, whereof one is placed more forward, the other more backward; for which reason the first may be termed coccygeus anterior, five iohio-coccygeus; the other coccygeus posterior, five sacro-coccygeus.\n\nThe coccygeus anterior is fixed by a broad insertion in the anterior portion of the small transverse ligament, at the upper part of the foramen ovale of the os innominatum, which is no more than a particular fold of the great transverse ligament of the pelvis. From thence it runs between this great ligament and the musculus obturator internus, and, contracting in breadth, it is inserted in the lower part of the os coccygis.\n\nThe coccygeus posterior, or sacro-coccygeus, is fixed to the inner or concave edge of the two first vertebrae of the os sacrum, to the inner and lower edge of the ligamentum sacro-sciaticum, and to the spine of the os ilium. From thence, contracting in breadth, it is inserted in the inside of the os coccygis above the former muscle.\n\nPsoas Parvus.\n\nThis is a long slender muscle, lying upon the psoas major.\n\nIt is fixed above by a short tendon, sometimes to the last transverse apophysis of the back, or higher; sometimes to the first of the loins, and sometimes to both. From thence it runs down wholly fleety, and more or less complex, on the great psoas, in a direction a little oblique.\n\nHaving reached the middle of the regio-lumbaris, or thereabouts, it forms a slender flat tendon, which gradually increasing in breadth, like a thin aponeurosis, runs over the psoas major and iliacus internus, at their union, and from thence down to the symphysis of the os pubis and os ilium, and is inserted chiefly in the crista of the os pubis, above the insertion of the pectines, sometimes sending an aponeurotic lamina further down.\n\nUses of the Muscles which move the Vertebrae.\n\nThe scaleni, when they act on each side at the same time, may assist in bringing the neck forward, when we lean back in any respect. When those of one side act by themselves, they make a lateral inflection, either of all the vertebrae of the neck together, as in bending the middle of the neck; or of some only, as in bending the lower part of the neck alone.\n\nThe longi colli bring the neck forward by the lower part of their inferior portions. When one of them acts alone, or acts more than the other, this motion is more or less oblique.\n\nBy the upper and greatest part of the lowest portion, they counterbalance the posterior muscles of these vertebrae, and hinder the neck from bending backward by the contraction of the sterno-mastoidei, when, lying on the back, we raise the head.\n\nThe transversalis major, transversalis gracilis, and the little transversales, acting on one side, can have no other use but to bend the neck laterally, and to hinder these inflexions when they act on both sides.\n\nThe semi-spinales or transverso-spinales of both sides acting together, extend the neck upon the trunk, to keep it from inclining forward in standing or sitting, and bend it backward. The semi-spinales of one side acting alone, produce the same motions in an oblique direction; and in that case they are assisted by the inferior or vertebral portion of the neighbouring splenius, under which they cross.\n\nThe semi-spinales of both sides may likewise serve for the rotation of the neck, but then the inferior splenius of the opposite side must assist them.\n\nThe inter-spinales are afflators to the semi-spinales in their mutual action, and may likewise serve to bring back the neck to its natural situation, after small motions of rotation.\n\nThe vertebrae of the back are moved by being bent forward, by being extended or straightened, and by being inflected directly or obliquely toward each side. The motion of rotation has no place here, because of the particular structure of the joints of these vertebrae, and their connexion with the ribs, which likewise hinder the flexion backward. Flexion and extension are the two principal motions, and much more apparent than the others.\n\nThe flexion of the back forward is not performed by any particular muscles, but depends, both in standing and sitting, on the relaxation of the muscles that extend or straighten it, and keep it in that erect posture.\n\nThe two sacro-lombares maintain the back and the regio-lumbaris in their natural situation when we stand or sit; and by the relaxation of their fibres more or less, the trunk is proportionally bent forward by the weight of the head and breast. They likewise extend the back and loins in all postures, keep them steady and fixed under the weight of burdens, and bend the loins backward.\n\nThe longissimus dorsi is an afflator to the sacro-lumbaris, especially to the vertebral portion of that muscle, which it helps very powerfully, both by the multiplicity and insertion of its fibres, in sustaining the vertebrae of the\nthe back and loins while extended, whether in sitting or standing, and in preventing their sinking under the weight of the body, or of any additional burden. It assists in performing and in counterbalancing all the motions and inflexions of which these vertebrae, especially those of the loins, are capable in all postures of the body.\n\nAll the spinales and transversales of the back and loins belonging to the clasps of the vertebrae recti, the spinales to the middle muscles, and the transversales to the lateral, their chief uses must be to assist, moderate, and maintain the motions of extension and lateral inflexion, whether simple and direct, or oblique and compound.\n\nThe semi-spinales, or transverso-spinales, being oblique, converging, vertebral muscles, are assistants to the sacro-lumbaris and longissimus dorsi, which they cross on each side.\n\nThe quadratus lumborum and psoas parvus are of the same use to the vertebrae of the loins, as the scaleni to those of the neck. When both quadrati act, they keep the lumbar pillar straight, that is, so as not to incline to either side, and then they may assist the recti of the abdomen in the inflexions forward, and the superior portions of the obliqui in lateral inflexions.\n\nThey may likewise serve to support the haunches alternately in walking; and, in standing on one foot, the quadratus of the opposite side may support the haunch of that side.\n\nThe psoas parvus, serves to sustain the pelvis much in the same manner with the musculi recti of the abdomen, in climbing, &c.\n\nThe coccygeus anterior may sustain the coccyx in \u00e6quilibrio, and hinder it from being bent backward, and from being luxated in great strains, as in the excretion of hardened faeces, &c.\n\nThe coccygeus posterior can only serve to replace the os coccygis when it has been forced backward, and to hinder it from being luxated backward.\n\n**Sect. XVI. The Muscles which move the Lower Jaw.**\n\n**MASSETER.**\n\nThis is a very thick fleshy muscle, situated at the back part of the cheek. It seems to be made up of three portions, like a triceps, viz. one large and external portion, one middle, and one small and internal.\n\nThe external portion is fixed by one tendinous extremity to all the inferior edge of the os maxill\u00e6, and a little to the neighbouring parts of the os maxillare and apophysis zygomatica of the os temporum. From thence it runs down obliquely backward, being wholly fleshy, and is inserted by the other extremity in the rough impression on the outside of the angle of the lower jaw.\n\nThe middle portion is fixed by one end to the lower edge of the whole apophysis zygomatica of the os temporum, and a very little to that of the os maxill\u00e6. From thence it runs down a little obliquely forward in an opposite direction to the first portion, under which it crofs\n\nfe\u00e6, and is inserted by its other extremity in the middle of the inside of the ramus of the lower jaw, near the insertion of the external portion with which it mixes.\n\nThe third portion, which is least and most internal, is fixed by one extremity to the inner labium of the lower edge, and also to the inside of almost all the zygomatic arch; and by the other, to the root or basis of the coronoid apophysis, where it mixes wholly fleshy with the insertion of the middle portion.\n\n**TEMPORALIS.**\n\nThis is a broad flat muscle, resembling the quadrant of a circle in figure. It occupies all the semi-circular or semi-oval plane of the lateral region of the cranium, the temporal fossa, and part of the zygomatic fossa. From this situation it has its name.\n\nTo conceive justly the insertions of this muscle, it must be observed, that the pericranium is divided into two laminae. The internal lamina, sometimes taken for a particular periosteum, covers immediately all the bony parts of this region. The external lamina separated from the other, is spread out like an aponeurotic or ligamentary tent, by means of its adhesions to the external angular apophysis of the os frontis, to the posterior edge of the superior apophysis of the os maxill\u00e6, and to the upper edge of all the zygomatic arch, all the way to the root of the mastoid apophysis.\n\nThis muscle is composed of two planes of fleshy fibres, fixed to the two sides of a tendinous plane nearly of the same breadth with them, like a concealed middle tendon; as may be plainly seen by dividing the muscle all the way to the bone, according to the direction of its fibres. The body of the muscle thus formed is inclosed between the two aponeurotic or ligamentary laminae in the following manner.\n\nThe internal fleshy plane is fixed, by a broad radiated insertion, to all the semi-circular plane of the cranium, by the intervention of the internal lamina of the periosteum.\n\nThus it is fixed to the lateral external part of the os frontis, and to its external angular apophysis, to the lower part of the os parietale, to the squamous portion of the os temporis, to the great ala or temporal apophysis of the sphenoidal bone, by which the temporal fossa is formed; and a little to the backside of the internal orbitary apophysis of the os maxill\u00e6, which forms part of the zygomatic fossa.\n\n**PTERYGOID\u00c6US MAJOR sine INTERNUS.**\n\nThis muscle lies on the inside of the lower jaw, almost in the same manner as the masseter does on the outside, being of the same figure with that muscle, only smaller and narrower.\n\nIt is fixed above in the pterygoid cavity, chiefly to the inside of the external ala of the apophysis pterygoide\u00e6.\n\nIt runs down obliquely toward the angle of the lower jaw, and is inserted a little tendinous in the inequalli-\nties on the inside thereof, opposite to the insertion of the masticator.\n\n**PTERYGOID\u00c6US MINOR** _five EXTERNUS._\n\nThis is an oblong fleshy muscle, much smaller than the other, and situated almost horizontally between the outside of the apophysis pterygoidea, and the condyloid apophysis of the lower jaw, the subject being considered in an erect posture.\n\nIt is fixed by one extremity to the outside and edge of the outer ala of the pterygoid apophysis, filling the fossula which is at the basis of this apophysis, near the basis of the temporal apophysis, of the sphenoidal bone.\n\nFrom thence it runs backward, and a little outward, into the void space between the two apophyses of the lower jaw, and is inserted anteriorly in the condyloid apophysis, at a small fossula immediately under the inner angle of the condyle. It is also fixed to the capsular ligament of the joint.\n\n**DIGASTRICUS.**\n\nThis is a small long muscle, situated laterally between the whole basis of the jaw and the throat. It is fleshy at both extremities, and tendinous in the middle, as if it consisted of two small muscles joined endwise by a tendon, and from thence it is called digastricus in Greek, and biventer in Latin.\n\nIt is fixed by one fleshy extremity in the fulcrum of the mastoid apophysis. From thence it runs forward, inclining towards the os hyoides, where the first fleshy body ends in a round tendon, which is connected to the lateral part and root of the cornua of that bone by a kind of aponeurotic ligament, and not by a vagina or pulley.\n\nHere the tendon is incurvated, and presently ends in the other fleshy body, which is fixed immediately above the internal labium of the basis of the chin near the symphysis, in a small unequal depression. This insertion is broader than that of the other extremity.\n\n**Uses of the Muscles which move the Lower Jaw.**\n\nThe two temporales acting together, raise the lower jaw, press the teeth in that jaw against the upper teeth, and pull it back when it has been carried so far forward as that the lower incisors got before the upper. They perform the last motion by their most posterior portion, which passes over the root of the zygomatic apophysis, and the other motions by the co-operation of all their muscular radii.\n\nThe two masticators serve to raise the lower jaw, and to push the lower teeth against the upper, in which use they co-operate with the temporales. They likewise bring this jaw forward by their external and largest portion; draw it back by their middle portion; and move it laterally by their superior portions acting alternately. By the co-operation of all the three portions, they press the lower teeth against the upper.\n\nBoth pterygoid\u00e6 interni serve to raise the lower jaw, to bring the lower teeth near the upper, and to move the jaw laterally, as in grinding the food.\n\nThe two pterygoid\u00e6 externi bring the lower jaw forward, in order to set the lower incisors before the upper; in which action they are antagonists to the posterior portion of the temporales, and the great portion of the masticators. When one of them acts, it carries the chin obliquely forward, or turns it toward the other side. This oblique motion is performed alternately by these two muscles acting singly.\n\nThe two digastrici serve to depress the lower jaw, and to open the mouth.\n\nThe force of these muscles is very considerable, as may be shewn by laying the elbow on a table, and leaning with the chin on the hand, while we endeavour at the same time to depress the lower jaw; for as in that case this jaw cannot descend, the digastrici, by their insertions in the apophysis mastoidea, raise the upper jaw, by bending the head backward on the condyles of the lower jaw.\n\n**Sect. XVII. The Muscles which move the Os Hyoides.**\n\n**MYLO-HYOID\u00c6US.**\n\nThis is a broad, thin, penniform muscle, situated transversely between the internal lateral parts of the basis of the lower jaw, and lying on the anterior portions of the two digastric muscles.\n\nIt is made up of two equal fleshy portions, one lying on the right side, the other on the left, both in the same plane, and joined to a small middle tendon, which is inserted anteriorly in the middle of the basis of the os hyoides, and from thence runs directly forward, diminishing gradually in its course.\n\nEach portion is fixed, by fleshy fibres, to the internal lateral part of the lower jaw, between the oblique prominent line and the basis, under the first four dentes molares and canines. The anterior and greatest part of the other fibres of each portion run obliquely from before backward, to the middle tendon, in which they are regularly fixed, the anterior fibres being the shortest, and a small triangular void space being formed between them and the symphysis of the chin.\n\nThe posterior fibres of each portion, which make about a fourth part of the whole, run likewise on each side to the basis of the os hyoides, and are inserted along the lower edge of its anterior or convex side, and from thence a little upward.\n\n**GENIO-HYOID\u00c6US.**\n\nThis is a small and pretty long fleshy muscle, situated between the symphysis of the chin and the os hyoides, close by its fellow.\n\nIt is fixed, by its anterior extremity, to a rough, and sometimes prominent surface, on the inner or posterior side of the symphysis of the lower jaw, a little above the chin. From thence it runs backward, and is inserted anteriorly in the upper edge of the basis of the os hyoides,\ndes, having first sent off a small lateral portion, which is fixed a little higher to the root of the cornu.\n\n**STYLO-HYOIDEUS.**\n\nThis is a small fleshy muscle, lying obliquely between the apophysis styloides and os hyoides.\n\nIt is fixed laterally, by one extremity, to the root or basis of the apophysis styloides, and, by the other, to the os hyoides, at the place where the basis and cornu unite, and likewise to the cornu itself, from whence it has been called stylo-cerato-hyoideus.\n\n**OMOPLATO-HYOIDEUS** *vive* **OMO-HYOIDEUS vulgo CORACO-HYOIDEUS.**\n\nThis is a very long small muscle, much narrower than the sterno-hyoideus, and situated obliquely on the side of the neck or throat, between the scapula and os hyoides.\n\nIt is commonly fixed, by the lower extremity, to the superior colta of the scapula, between the small notch and the angle, and sometimes very near the angle.\n\nFrom thence it passes over the coracoid apophysis, adhering sometimes to it by a kind of aponeurosis, or membranous ligament, and from this adhesion the name of coraco-hyoideus was given it by some who had not discovered its main insertion.\n\nIt is likewise often fixed to the clavicle by ligamentary or fleshy fibres; and has sometimes been seen inserted in the whole middle portion of that bone, being inseparably united with the sterno-hyoideus.\n\nHaving passed the clavicle, it is bent forward, and runs between the sterno-mastoideus and internal jugular vein, the small middle tendon being situated in this place. From thence it runs up to its insertion in the inferior lateral part of the basis of the os hyoides, near the cornu, and insertion of the sterno-hyoideus, which it covers a little.\n\n**STERNO-HYOIDEUS** *vive* **STERNO-CLEIDO-HYOIDEUS.**\n\nThis is a long, thin, flat muscle, broader at the lower than at the upper part, and situated, together with its fellow, on the fore-side of the throat.\n\nIt is fixed, by its lower extremity, in the superior and lateral part of the inner or posterior side of the sternum, in the posterior part of the external extremity of the clavicle, in the transverse ligament which connects these two bones, and in the inner or back-side of the cartilage of the first rib. All these other insertions are more considerable than that in the sternum, which is sometimes scarce perceivable.\n\nFrom thence it runs up on the fore-side of the aspera arteria, joined to its fellow by a membrane, which forms a sort of linea alba, and is inserted laterally in the lower edge of the basis of the os hyoides.\n\n**Uses of the Muscles which move the Os Hyoides.**\n\nThe mechanism observed in the motions of the os hy-\n\noideus, as well as in those of the scapula, is very particular, and very different from what we find in all the other bones of the human body. All these bones have solid fulcra, on which they are either moved or kept fixed by the proper muscles, after the manner of a lever or otherwise; whereas the os hyoides is merely suspended, having nothing to fix it but these very muscles which move it in different manners.\n\nThe mylo-hyoideus represents a moveable floor or bed, which sustains the tongue with its muscles and glands, and forms the bottom of the cavity of the mouth. When the two portions of this muscle act together, they draw the os hyoides a little forward, and fix it in that situation, raising the whole tongue at the same time, and compressing the glandula sub-lingualis. If one lateral portion acts more than the other, it puts the os hyoides in an oblique situation, and in a condition to serve as a fixed point for the motions of the tongue.\n\nThe genio-hyoidei pull the os hyoides much more forward than the mylo-hyoideus; and as they are very narrow, and closely united together, there seems to be very little occasion for one of them to act without the other.\n\nThe stylo-hyoidei move the os hyoides upward and backward in a middle direction, between those in which they lie; and they draw it more upward and backward when they act freely; that is, without being checked or confined by other muscles, in the manner which we shall see hereafter. When one acts more than the other, the bone is moved obliquely.\n\nThe omo-hyoidei, or coraco-hyoidei, act as the stylo-hyoidei, in a middle direction between the oblique directions in which they lie, and draw the os hyoides downward and backward, when they are not counterbalanced by the stylo-hyoidei. When one acts more than the other, the bone is drawn obliquely to the right or left hand.\n\nWhen these muscles and the stylo-hyoidei act together, the os hyoides is drawn backward by a direct motion compounded of four oblique motions. This compound motion is directed more upward or more laterally, according to the degree of action of the stylo-hyoidei, or omo-hyoidei, or of any one muscle of each pair; and in all these motions the four muscles are counterbalanced by the genio-hyoidei.\n\nThe sterno-hyoidei draw the os hyoides directly downward, and serve to counterbalance the different motions of the stylo-hyoidei, omo-hyoidei, and genio-hyoidei. They may, in some cases, be assisted by the sterno-thyroidei, and thyro-hyoidei, as we shall see hereafter.\n\nAccording to the method commonly observed in complete treatises of myology, the following muscles remain still to be described, viz. The muscles of the forehead, occiput, palpebrae, eye, external ear, nose, lips, tongue, uvula, ductus Eustachianus, pharynx, larynx, parts of generation, anus, and bladder; and to these we ought even to add the heart, as Mr Cowper has done in the late edition of his Myotomy. But the description of these will be better understood when we treat of the parts to which they belong.

They compels the abdomen, in order to clear it of what ought to pass off by the natural outlets; to relieve the stomach, by vomiting, from whatever might be hurtful to it; and, lastly, to drive out, by a violent expiration, whatever may incommode the organs contained in the thorax.\n\nThe musculi recti serve to support the trunk of the body when inclined backward, and to bend or bring it forward again; to raise the body up when lying; and, lastly, to climb.\n\nThe pyramidales seem only to assist the action of the recti; though, when we consider the oblique direction of their fibres toward the linea alba, there may be some reason to think that they compels the bladder, especially when very full of urine.\n\nThe transversales seem to have no other use than that of bracing or girding the abdomen in different degrees.\n\nSECT.

It likewise moves the second row of the carpus on the first.\n\nThis muscle, acting alone, draws obliquely, and toward the external angle of the radius, that portion of the hand which answers to the first metacarpal bone, and to the index.\n\nThe ulnaris gracilis, commonly called palmaris longus, seems to be an assistant to the ulnaris and radialis interni in bending the wrist; and it seems likewise particularly to assist the radialis internus in the motion of pronation.\n\nThe metacarpus serves to turn the fourth bone of the metacarpus toward the thumb, and at the same time to increase the convexity of the back of the hand, which is called making Diogenes's cup. The fourth bone thus moved carries the third along with it by reason of their connection, which still augments the hollow on one side, and the convexity on the other.\n\nSect. VIII. The Muscles which move the Fingers.","sp":241,"ep":242},{"h":"VENTRICULUS","t":"or STOMACH.**\n\nThe stomach is a great bag or reservoir, situated partly in the left hypochondrium, and partly in the epigastrium.\n\nThe figure of the stomach is like that of a bag-pipe, oblong, incurvated, large and capacious at one end, and small and contracted at the other.\n\nThe curvature of the stomach gives us occasion to distinguish two arches in it; one large, which runs along the greatest convexity; and one small, directly opposite to the former. The sides of the stomach, are the two lateral portions which lie between the two arches.\n\nThe stomach has two extremities, one large, and one small like a crooked funnel. It has two openings, called the orifices of the stomach, one between the great extremity and the small curvature, the other at the end of the small or contracted extremity. The first opening is a continuation of the oesophagus; the other joins the intestinal canal, and is called pylorus.\n\nThe great extremity of the stomach is in the left hypochondrium, and for the most part immediately under the diaphragm.\n\nThe small extremity of the stomach does not reach to the right hypochondrium. It bends obliquely backward toward the upper orifice, so that the pylorus lies about two fingers breadth from the body of the vertebrae immediately under the small portion of the liver, and consequently lower down, and more forward than the other orifice by almost the same distance.\n\nAccording to this natural situation, the stomach, especially when full, lies so as that the great curvature is turned more upward than downward, and the small curvature more backward than upward.\n\nOne of the lateral convex sides is turned upward, the other downward; and not forward and backward, as they appear in dead bodies, where the intestines do not support them in their natural situation.\n\nThe stomach is composed of several parts, the chief of which are the different strata which form its substance, to which anatomists give the name of tunicae or coats. These coats are commonly reckoned to be four in number, the outer or common, the fleshy or muscular, the nervous or aponeurotic, and the villous or inner coat; and they are afterwards subdivided several ways.\n\nThe first or outermost coat is simply membranous, being one of the internal productions of the peritoneum.\n\nThe second or muscular coat is made up of several planes of fibres, which may all be reduced to two, one external, the other internal. The external coat is longitudinal, though in different respects, following nearly the direction of the curvatures and convexities of the stomach; and the internal plane is transversely circular.\n\nBetween the outer and inner planes, round the superior orifice, there are two distinct planes, about the breadth of a finger, and very oblique, which surround this orifice in opposite directions, and intersect each other where they meet on the two lateral sides.\n\nAlong the middle of each lateral side of the small extremity, there runs a tendinous or ligamentary flat portion, above a quarter of an inch in breadth, which terminates in the pylorus. These two portions lie between the common and muscular coats, and adhere very strongly to the first.\n\nBetween the same two coats, there is a cellular substance which adheres very closely to the external coat, and infiluates itself between the fleshy fibres of the second, all the way to the third.\n\nThe third coat, called commonly tunica nervosa, sustains, on its convex side, a very large reticular distribution of capillary vessels and nerves. On the concave side, it seems to be of a very loose texture, and as it were spungy or filamentary, containing a great number of small glandular bodies, especially near the small curvature and small extremity of the stomach.\n\nThe fourth coat of the stomach is termed villosa, because, when it swims in clear water, some have imagined they saw something in it like the pile of velvet.\n\nThese two coats are of a larger extent than the two, former,\nThe Intestines in general, and Intestinum Duodenum in particular.\n\nBetween the pylorus and the very lowest part of the abdomen, lies a long canal, bent in a great many different directions, by numerous convolutions or turnings, called the intestins.\n\nThis canal, thus folded and turned, forms a considerable bulk, which fills the greatest part of the cavity of the abdomen; and it is connected, through its whole extent, to membranous productions or continuations of the peritoneum, principally to those called the mesentery and mesocolon.\n\nThe incurvations of the intestinal canal form two arches, a small one by which it is connected to the mesentery and mesocolon, and a great one on the opposite side, which lies loose. The whole canal is generally about seven or eight times as long as the body.\n\nThe intestines in general are composed of several coats, much in the same manner with the stomach. The first and outermost is a continuation of the mesentery, or of some other elongation or duplicature of the peritoneum.\n\nThis is commonly termed the common coat; and it has a cellular sublance on its inner surface, like that of the stomach.\n\nThe second coat of the intestines is fleshy or muscular, and made up of two planes, one external, the other internal. The external plane is very thin, and its fibres longitudinal; the internal plane is thicker, and its fibres run transversely round the circumference of the intestinal cylinder.\n\nThe third coat is called nervosa, and is something like that of the stomach. It has a particular plane, which serves as a basis to sustain it, made up of very fine, strong, oblique fibres, which seem to be of the ligamentary or tendinous kind.\n\nThis coat sustains two reticular substances which are both vascular, one arterial, the other venal, accompanied by a great number of nervous filaments. These vessels and nerves are productions of the mesenteric vessels and nerves; and as they surround the whole canal of the intestines, some anatomists have formed them into a distinct coat, by the name of tunica vasculosa.\n\nThe nervous coat sends off from its inner surface a great number of portions of septa, more or less circular, which contribute to the formation of what are called valvula conniventes.\n\nThe fourth or innermost coat is very soft, and is named tunica villosa. It has the same extent with the third coat, which supports it, and it lines all the septa of that third coat.\n\nThe small intestines form one continued uniform canal; and though three portions of it have three different names, yet we have no sufficient marks whereby to distinguish them, to fix the precise extent or length of each portion, to settle its just limits.\n\nThe first and shortest portion of the whole canal, is called duodenum; the second, which is much longer, jejunum; and the third, which is still longer than the second, ileum.\nThe duodenum having arisen from the pylorus, is immediately bent a little backward, and obliquely downward; then it bends a second time toward the right kidney, to which it is a little connected, and from thence passes before the renal artery and vein, ascending insensibly from right to left, till it gets before the aorta and last vertebra of the back. It continues its course obliquely forward, by a gentle turn.\n\nThrough this whole course, the duodenum is firmly bound down by folds of the peritoneum, especially by a transverse duplicature which gives origin to the mecocolon.\n\nThe villi of this intestine are thicker than in the stomach; but the texture of them in man is not like hairs, as they are commonly represented in figures; but rather like that of a fungous granulated substance, composed of an infinite number of very fine papillae of different figures, in which we see, through a microscope, a multitude of depressed points or pores, by which their whole surface seems to be pierced.\n\nBy the same help we observe, on different places of the inner surface of this intestine, several round villous tubercles, rising like small verrucae at different distances from each other.\n\nThis substance sustains an infinite number of capillary vessels, of different kinds; for besides the blood-vessels, we sometimes observe a great number of white filaments which run through it, and end at its inner surface, like so many capillary roots of the vessels, called ven\u00e6 lact\u00e6.\n\nThe internal surface of the duodenum is furnished with a great number of small flat glandular tubercles, raised on the sides, and depressed in the middle, by a kind of fossula; and they are more numerous near the beginning of this intestine than anywhere else.\n\nThese glands appear like little bladders, with the orifices turned toward the cavity of the intestine, and the bodies fixed in the spungy substance next the nervous coat. They furnish a particular viscid fluid.\n\nIn the inner surface of the duodenum, almost at the lower part of the first incursion, and on the shortest side, there is a longitudinal eminence, in the point or apex of which lies a particular opening, which is the orifice of the ductus bilarius, within which the ductus pancreaticus likewise opens.\n\n**Intestinum Jejunum.**\n\nThe jejunum, so called, because it is oftener found empty than the ilium, begins at the last incursion of the duodenum, and is there connected to the beginning of the mecocolon.\n\nFrom thence it bends downward from left to right, and obliquely forward, or from the vertebrae, and makes several convolutions, which lie chiefly in the upper part of the umbilical region. Through all this course it is connected to the mecoenteric.\n\nThe jejunum and ilium may be distinguished by dividing both intestines into five parts; and to allow nearly two fifths to the jejunum, and three fifths and a little more to the ileum.\n\nThe coats of the jejunum are nearly of the same structure with those of the duodenum, but thinner.\n\n**Intestinum Ileum.**\n\nThe convolutions of the intestinum ileum surround those of the jejunum on the two lateral and lower sides, and it passes in a winding course from the left side, by the hypogastrum, to the right side, where it terminates a little below the right kidney, joining the intestina crassa.\n\nThe structure of the ileum is much the same with that of the jejunum; only the internal duplicatures or valvulae conniventes decrease gradually both in number and size.\n\n*The Intestina Crassa in general, and Intestinum c\u00e6cum in particular.*\n\nThe great intestines are one continued canal, divided into three portions, like the small ones. This canal begins by a kind of sacculus or bag, which is reckoned the first of the three portions, and called c\u00e6cum. The second portion, called colon, is the longest of the three, and is distinguished from them by a great number of particular eminences or convexities, which appear on its outer surface through its whole length. The last portion is named rectum, being more uniform, narrower, thicker, and much shorter than the colon.\n\nThe structure of the great intestines is nearly the same with that of the small ones, in regard both to the number and disposition of their coats. They are shorter, and have fewer convolutions, but are much more capacious. The coats in general are stronger, but especially the muscular coat.\n\nThe intestinum c\u00e6cum is only a round short broad bag, the bottom of which is turned downward, and the mouth or opening upward. It lies under the right kidney, and is hid by the last convolution of the ileum. It is about three fingers breadth in length, and its diameter is more than double that of the small intestines.\n\nOn one side of the bottom of the c\u00e6cum lies an appendix, resembling a small intestine, nearly of the same length with the c\u00e6cum, but very slender. It is termed appendicula vermiformis, from its supposed resemblance to an earth-worm. Its common diameter is not above a quarter of an inch. By one extremity it opens laterally, and a little obliquely, into the bottom of the c\u00e6cum; and the other extremity is closed, being sometimes greater, sometimes smaller, than the rest of the appendix.\n\nThrough the membranous or common coat of the c\u00e6cum, we see three white ligamentary bands, which adhere very closely both to the outer and muscular coat. One of them is hid by the adhesion of the mecocolon; and all the three divide the c\u00e6cum longitudinally into three parts more or less equal.\n\nThey all unite in the appendicula vermiformis, and cover its whole outer side immediately under the common coat.","sp":304,"ep":306},{"h":"VESICA URINARIA","t":"The bladder is a kind of membranous and fleshy pouch or bottle, capable of dilatation and contraction, situated in the lower part of the abdomen, immediately behind the symphysis of the os pubis, and opposite to the beginning of the intestinum rectum. The figure of it is nearly that of a short oval. It is broader on the fore and back sides, than on the lateral parts; rounder above than below when empty, and broader below than above when full.\n\nIt is divided into the body, neck, and bottom; into an anterior, posterior, and two lateral parts. The upper part is termed the fundus or bottom; and the neck is a portion of the lower part, which is contracted like the gullet of some vessels.\n\nThe bladder is made up of several coats. That part of the external coat which covers the upper, posterior, and lateral sides of the bladder, is the true lamina or membrane of the peritoneum; and the rest of it is surrounded by a cellular substance, by the intervention of which, the peritoneum is connected to the muscular coat.\n\nThe proper coats are three in number, one muscular, one nervous, and one villous, which is the innermost. The muscular coat is composed of several strata of fleshy fibres; the outermost of which are mostly longitudinal; the next to these are more inclined toward each hand; and the innermost, more and more oblique; and they become at length almost transverse.\n\nThe nervous coat is nearly of the same structure with the tunica nervosa of the stomach.\n\nThe internal coat is something granulated and glandular, and a mucilaginous serum is continually discharged through it, which moistens the inner surface of the bladder and defends it against the acrimony of the urine.\n\nAt the top of the bladder, above the symphysis of the os pubis, we observe a ligamentary rope, which runs up between the peritoneum and the linea alba of the abdomen, all the way to the navel, diminishing gradually in thickness as it ascends. This rope had a particular use in the fetus, as shall be said in another place. It is sufficient to add here, that it is in part originally a production of the inner coats of the bladder, which production is termed urachus.\n\nThis rope is composed likewise of two other ligamentary elongations, which are the extremities of the umbilical arteries. These arteries come from the hypogastric\u00e6, run up by the sides of the bladder, and remain hollow and filled with blood, even in adults, as high as the middle of the bladder, through all which space they likewise send off ramifications. Afterwards they lose their cavity, and become ligamentary as they ascend.\nAt the upper part of the bladder, they approach each other; and, joining the urachus, form that rope, which may be termed the superior ligament of the bladder.\n\nThe lower part of the bladder, which deserves the name of fundus much better than the upper part, is perforated by three openings, one anterior, and two posterior. The anterior opening is formed by an elongation of all the proper coats, in form of a gullet, turned much in the same manner with the inner orifice of the rostrum of the head of an alembic. This elongation is called the neck of the bladder, the description of which belongs to that of the parts of generation in men.\n\nThe other two openings in the true fundus of the bladder, are formed by the ureters, which, in their course downward already described, run behind the spermatic vessels, and then behind the lower part of the bladder, approaching each other. Each ureter lies between the umbilical artery and vas deferens of the same side, the artery lying on the outside of the ureter, and the vas deferens on the inside.\n\nAfterwards they get between the vasa deferentia and the bladder, crossing these canals: and then at about a finger's breadth from each other, they begin to pierce the coats of the bladder. They run a little way between the mucular and nervous coats, and open into the bladder obliquely, something nearer each other than when they first entered its coats.\n\nThe orifices of the ureters in the bladder, are something oval, and narrower than the cavity of the ureters immediately above them. The edge of these orifices is very thin, and seems to be formed merely by the union of the internal coat of the bladder with that of the ureters.\n\nBesides the ligaments already mentioned, there are likewise two small ones, by which the anterior part of the true fundus of the bladder is connected to the osseous pubis, which shall be described with the neck and sphincter after the history of the parts of generation in both sexes.","sp":319,"ep":320},{"h":"WASTE-BOOK","t":"Edinburgh, the 1st of January 1769.\n\nAn Inventory of the money, goods, and debts belonging to me A.
